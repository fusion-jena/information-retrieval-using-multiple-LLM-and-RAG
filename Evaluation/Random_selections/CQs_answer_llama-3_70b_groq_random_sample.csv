The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that some measures were taken to address this issue.

For instance, the context mentions that the authors ""sought to explore different network sizes in conjunction with pre-training with additional acoustic reference data from outside of our audio domain, followed by fine-tuning with ROI data from our study site.""

One measure taken was to split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

Another measure taken was to keep the integrity of events during data splitting. Since the camera trap image datasets (SS and LSM) comprised capture events, where multiple images in succession were captured, the authors made sure to put all images of an event into the same dataset. This was done to prevent splitting images within an event into training and test sets, which could lead to poor generalization of the model.

Although cross-validation is mentioned in the context, it is stated that conducting large CV experiments with deep learning-based models is often infeasible due to their high computational costs. Therefore, the strategy of separating data into training, validation, and testing was used to reduce over-training issues and evaluate the model's generalization in a specific domain when cross-validation is not feasible.

This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and random sampling of batches. By setting a random seed value, researchers can ensure that their results are reproducible and comparable across different runs of the experiment.

In the context of this study, it is likely that the authors employed some strategy to handle randomness, but the details are not provided.

However, it is mentioned that ""our dataset was balanced"", which suggests that the dataset may have been preprocessed to ensure class balance, but the specific technique used is not mentioned. Additionally, the context mentions that various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes were used during training, which can help reduce overfitting and improve model robustness, but these are not specifically aimed at addressing data bias.",Publication_99.pdf_CQ26.txt

These techniques were used to augment the data during the training of the classification model. However, it is not specified whether these techniques were also applied to the PConv networks or Pix2Pix networks.",Publication_99.pdf_CQ4.txt
"What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?","The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is ImageNet. This is mentioned in the context where it is stated that the input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Additionally, it is mentioned that the classification model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets in the provided context.",Publication_99.pdf_CQ5.txt
"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","According to the provided context, the preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaling between 0 and 1. This is mentioned in the text as ""All input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1.""",Publication_99.pdf_CQ6.txt
"What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?","Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the model architectures, hyperparameters, and training procedures for PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks. It does mention the use of a validation set for model evaluation and saving the best model based on validation loss, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets.
