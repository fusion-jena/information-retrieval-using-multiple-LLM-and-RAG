The provided text focuses on the application of Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms to classify the maturity of Chilean hake.  

While the text mentions machine learning in general and its use in reproductive biology, it doesn't specify the purpose of the deep learning model. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what the purpose of the deep learning model is.
