The provided text describes the dataset creation process but doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used. It mentions that spectrogram images were "manually labeled via visual inspection" by trained graduate students into sound categories. 

While it doesn't explicitly state techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, the description suggests a **classification** approach.  The annotators likely assigned each spectrogram image to a predefined sound category (biophony, anthrophony, geophony).
