The provided text describes the model optimization process but doesn't specify the exact hyperparameters used (e.g., learning rate, optimizer).  It mentions that the model architecture involves a large number of hyperparameters related to convolutional and recurrent layers, but it doesn't list them. 

The text focuses on the Hyperband algorithm for optimizing these hyperparameters and a "successive halving" strategy to identify promising configurations.
