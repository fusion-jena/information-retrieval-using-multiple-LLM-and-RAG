The text states that the overall accuracy results were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.  Specifically, it mentions:

* **Accuracy:**  The text reports accuracy for both training (96.34%) and test data (97.53%) for the four-class classification model. 

* **Confusion Matrix:** The text provides confusion matrices for both the four-class and five-class models. Confusion matrices are a common tool for evaluating classification models by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class.
