The provided text describes the training process and mentions the use of metrics like accuracy and error rate. It also states that the model's performance is tracked and saved after each epoch. 

However, it doesn't explicitly detail the specific strategy used to monitor performance *during* training.  We know the training loss is tracked (as shown in the output), but details about how accuracy, error rate, or other potential metrics are visualized or used for real-time monitoring are not given.
