The provided text mentions that the dataset used for training the deep learning model may not fully capture the diverse range of bird populations present in the wild. It highlights potential biases in the dataset due to factors like geographical bias, limited sample sizes, or underrepresentation of certain bird species. 

However, the text does not explicitly describe specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:** While it acknowledges the potential lack of diversity, it doesn't state whether efforts were made to collect a more comprehensive dataset.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the data was split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling to maintain the class distribution. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
