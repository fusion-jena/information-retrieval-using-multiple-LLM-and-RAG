The provided text describes the use of data augmentation during the training process, but it doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used to create the initial dataset for training the deep learning models. 


Therefore, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques were used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation).
