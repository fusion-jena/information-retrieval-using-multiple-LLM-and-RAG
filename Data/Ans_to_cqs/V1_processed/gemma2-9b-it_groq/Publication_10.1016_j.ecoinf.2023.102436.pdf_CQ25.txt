The provided text focuses on the use of image-based methods and 3D models in landscape planning and design.  While it mentions a convolutional neural network used for recognizing woody regrowth vegetation, it doesn't explicitly state the purpose of the model beyond that specific application. 

Based on the context, we can infer that the convolutional neural network is likely used for **object detection** in this case. It identifies and locates woody regrowth vegetation within landscape photographs.
