The provided text focuses on the methodology for developing machine learning models to predict chlorophyll-a concentrations using water quality data. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model architecture.
