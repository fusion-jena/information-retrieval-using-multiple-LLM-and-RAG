The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of specific deep learning models (SegFormer and EPDNet) and doesn't delve into general preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps often include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) or min-max scaling can be used to ensure features have similar scales.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:**  Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for many machine learning algorithms.

* **Image Preprocessing:** For image data, this might involve resizing, cropping, color adjustments, and converting images to a suitable format (e.g., RGB or grayscale). 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
