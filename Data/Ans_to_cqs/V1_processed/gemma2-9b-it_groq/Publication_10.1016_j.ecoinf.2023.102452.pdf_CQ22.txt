The provided text focuses on a study comparing different deep learning models for streamflow forecasting.  It mentions several statistical performance metrics used to evaluate these models. 

The key metrics listed are:

* **MEE (Mean Error)**:  This metric likely measures the average difference between the predicted streamflow and the actual streamflow.
* **DW (Data Window)**: This metric is not clearly defined in the context provided. It might refer to a specific data windowing technique used in the models.
* **DWE (Data Window Error)**: Similar to DW, this metric is not fully explained but likely relates to errors associated with a specific data windowing approach.
* **NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency)**: This is a widely used metric in hydrology and water resources to assess the goodness of fit of a model. It ranges from -âˆž to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit.

The text also mentions **GP (Genetic Programming)** and **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)** in the context of these models.
