The provided text focuses on text mining and semantic analysis techniques for understanding perceptions of hikers from Wikiloc posts. It doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on general knowledge of machine learning best practices, here are some techniques commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target variables as the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards certain groups during model training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from underrepresented classes to balance the dataset and give them more weight during training.

* **Undersampling:** This technique removes instances from overrepresented classes to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  The most effective way to mitigate bias is to collect data from a diverse range of sources and ensure it represents the population you aim to model.
