The provided text states that training was conducted for 100 epochs.  It also mentions using a validation set to check for overfitting. 

However, it does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training was complete.  We can infer that the training process likely stopped after 100 epochs, regardless of whether the validation loss plateaued or not.
