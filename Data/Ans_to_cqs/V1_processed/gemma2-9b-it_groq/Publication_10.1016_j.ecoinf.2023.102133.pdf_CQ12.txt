The provided text states that a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is used.  While MLPs are a type of artificial neural network, they are not typically categorized as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers. 

CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are specialized for image data, RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) are designed for sequential data, and Transformers are powerful architectures for natural language processing. 

The MLP used in this pipeline is a general-purpose feedforward network suitable for various types of data.
