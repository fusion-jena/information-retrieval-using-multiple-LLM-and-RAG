Several techniques are used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. These techniques aim to create a more balanced and representative dataset, mitigating the potential for biased model outcomes. Here are some common approaches:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets maintain the same proportions of different classes or groups present in the original dataset. This helps prevent overrepresentation of certain groups during training, leading to more balanced model performance.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from underrepresented classes to increase their frequency in the dataset. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can generate synthetic samples for minority classes, further enhancing their representation.

* **Undersampling:** This approach reduces the number of instances from overrepresented classes to balance the dataset. It's important to note that simply removing data can lead to information loss, so careful selection of instances to remove is crucial.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Addressing bias at the source is essential.  Actively seeking out and incorporating data from diverse sources and representing various demographics, backgrounds, and perspectives can help create a more inclusive and representative dataset from the outset.

* **Reweighing:** Assigning different weights to instances during training can compensate for class imbalances. Instances from underrepresented classes can be given higher weights, ensuring they contribute more significantly to the learning process.

The choice of technique depends on the specific nature of the bias, the dataset size, and the desired outcome.  It's often beneficial to combine multiple techniques for a more comprehensive approach to mitigating data bias.
