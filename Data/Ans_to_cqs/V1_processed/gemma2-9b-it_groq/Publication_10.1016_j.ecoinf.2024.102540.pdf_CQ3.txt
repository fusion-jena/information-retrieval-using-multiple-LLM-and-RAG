The provided text describes the use of polygon tools within the Roboflow environment for annotating images of alates on sorghum leaves.  

Specifically, it mentions:

* **Polygon annotation:** This technique is used to draw polygons around the alates in the images. This allows the model to learn the precise shape and boundaries of the target object. 

The text doesn't explicitly mention other data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, but it's likely that these techniques could also be used in this pipeline.
