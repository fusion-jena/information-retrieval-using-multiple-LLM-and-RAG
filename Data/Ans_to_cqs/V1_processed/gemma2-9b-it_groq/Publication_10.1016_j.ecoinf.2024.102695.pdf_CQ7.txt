The provided text states that the dataset is divided chronologically into three sets:

* **70% for the training set:** This is the largest portion used to train the deep learning model. 
* **10% for the validation set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to tune hyperparameters. 
* **20% for the test set:** This set is held out until the very end to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final trained model's performance on unseen data. 


The chronological split aims to better simulate real-world scenarios by ensuring that the validation and test sets contain data different from the training set, thus enhancing the model's generalizability.
