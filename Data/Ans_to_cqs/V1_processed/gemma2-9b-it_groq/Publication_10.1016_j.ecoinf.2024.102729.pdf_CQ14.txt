The provided text does not specify the exact method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the random forest (RF) model.  

It mentions that the RF model with 25 trees as hyperparameters achieved the highest accuracy for a particular season. However, it doesn't describe the process of determining the optimal number of trees or any other hyperparameter tuning techniques employed.
