The provided text focuses on a deep learning method for phylogenetic placement called DEPP and doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the pipeline.  

However, we can infer some information:

* **Sequence data:** The core of the method involves analyzing biological sequences (likely DNA or protein). These sequences are represented as strings of characters (e.g., A, C, G, T for DNA). 
* **Distance matrices:** DEPP calculates distances between sequences, which are likely represented as numerical matrices.
* **Tree structures:**  Phylogenetic trees are used as reference structures and are likely represented in a tree-like data structure.

Therefore, while the text doesn't explicitly mention formats like CSV, it strongly suggests that the pipeline deals with sequence data, numerical distance matrices, and tree structures.
