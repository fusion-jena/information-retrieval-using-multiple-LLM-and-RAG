The data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include:

* **Rotation:** Images are rotated by a certain angle.
* **Reflection bias:** The reflectance of the image is randomly adjusted by ±10%.
* **Random noise:** Random noise of ±10% reflectance is added to 15% of the input image.
