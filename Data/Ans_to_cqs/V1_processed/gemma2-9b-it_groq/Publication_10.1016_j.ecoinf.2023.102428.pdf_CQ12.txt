The provided text states that the model uses a "multi-layer perceptron (MLP)" algorithm.  

While MLPs are a type of artificial neural network, they are not typically categorized as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers. 

CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are specialized for image data, RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) are good for sequential data, and Transformers are designed for processing text and have gained popularity in natural language processing.
