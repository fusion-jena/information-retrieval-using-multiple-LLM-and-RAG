The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for improving NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study.  

While it mentions using "deep-learning enhanced fusion methods," it doesn't explicitly state the specific type of deep learning model used (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine the precise purpose of the deep learning model.
