The provided text focuses on using random forest models for grassland analysis and doesn't delve into the specifics of data splitting for deep learning. 

Deep learning typically uses a similar data splitting strategy as other machine learning models:

* **Training Set:** The largest portion of the data, used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation Set:** A subset of the data used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

* **Test Set:** A separate, unseen portion of the data used only once at the end of training to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's final performance.

The exact proportions of each set can vary, but a common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. 

The choice of splitting criteria depends on the specific dataset and the task.
