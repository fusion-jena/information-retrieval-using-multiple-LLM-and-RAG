The provided text does not specify the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.  It only mentions the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 


While ANNs are a broad category,  the text doesn't give details that would allow us to narrow it down to a more specific type like CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), or Transformer.
