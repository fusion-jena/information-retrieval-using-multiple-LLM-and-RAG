The provided text focuses on the data preprocessing and model training stages using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR).  It doesn't delve into post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are used to visualize which input features are most influential in the model's predictions.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Common metrics for evaluating model performance include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and R-squared.
* **Confusion matrix:** This matrix shows the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing insights into the types of errors the model makes. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
