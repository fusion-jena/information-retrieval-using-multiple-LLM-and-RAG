The provided text describes the use of bounding box annotation for the dataset. 

It states: "Subsequently, an object detection network (YOLOv5) was trained on the manually annotated subset and then applied for detection on the remaining images. However, due to the small and unbalanced nature of the dataset, the detection of pollen-bearing bees was often missed. Consequently, the results underwent manual verification to establish the ground truth bounding boxes." 


This indicates that humans manually drew bounding boxes around pollen-bearing bees in the images to create the training dataset for the object detection model.
