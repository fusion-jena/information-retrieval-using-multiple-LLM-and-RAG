The provided text describes the model evaluation strategy rather than the performance monitoring strategy during training. 

The text states that the performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix calculated on 20% of the data not used for training.  It also mentions the use of 5 K-Folds cross-validation, where each iteration used a different portion of the data for testing. 

However, it does not explain how the model's performance was monitored *during* the training process.
