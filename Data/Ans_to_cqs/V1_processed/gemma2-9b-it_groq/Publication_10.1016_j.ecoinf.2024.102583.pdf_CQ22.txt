The text provides information about four metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models:

* **AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve):**  A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between landslide and non-landslide pixels. 
* **Overall Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified landslide and non-landslide pixels.
* **Kappa Score:**  A statistic that measures the agreement between the model's predictions and the actual landslide occurrences, taking into account the possibility of agreement due to chance.
* **F1-Score:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.
