The provided text mentions using transfer learning with pre-trained COCO weights. It also states that the utility of these pre-trained CNNs is constrained by how relevant the novel input data are to the data the CNN was originally trained on. 

However, the text doesn't specify details about other measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While it mentions the taxonomic imbalance in existing datasets, it doesn't describe the specific diversity of the dataset used for training or evaluation.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention any cross-validation techniques used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken beyond transfer learning to ensure the generalizability of the model.
