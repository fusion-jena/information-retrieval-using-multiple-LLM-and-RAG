The provided text describes the use of data augmentation techniques (horizontal flip, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction) to increase the size of the training dataset.  

However, it does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model beyond this data augmentation.  The text does state that the model was trained and tested on data from two field sites (Pelican Mountain and Calling Lake) and that a third field site (Conklin) was used solely for independent validation. This suggests a form of hold-out validation, but it doesn't explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.
