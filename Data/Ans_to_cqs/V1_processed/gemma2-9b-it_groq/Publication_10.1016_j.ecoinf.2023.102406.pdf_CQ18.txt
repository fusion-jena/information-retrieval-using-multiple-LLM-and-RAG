The provided text describes the evaluation of model performance using a separate testing dataset, comprising 25% of the total samples. This testing data was withheld from the training process.  

The accuracy of the classifier was assessed using metrics such as the true positive rate (sensitivity) and the true negative rate (specificity). These metrics measure the model's ability to correctly classify instances belonging to a particular class. 

The text doesn't explicitly mention any strategies implemented to monitor model performance *during* training.
