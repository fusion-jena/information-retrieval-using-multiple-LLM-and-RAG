While the provided text describes a framework for classifying bleached and healthy coral using deep learning, it doesn't explicitly detail the preprocessing steps taken before training the model. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer some likely preprocessing steps:

* **Image Resizing:**  The input images from the underwater drone are likely resized to a standard size compatible with the chosen deep learning model (e.g., 224x224 pixels).

* **Normalization:**  Pixel values are often normalized to a range between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps improve model training stability and convergence.

* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like random cropping, flipping, and rotation might be applied to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, making the model more robust.

* **Feature Extraction:** As mentioned, handcrafted features and features extracted from a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (AlexNet in this case) are used. This suggests that the raw image data is first processed to extract relevant features.


It's important to note that without the full details of the implementation, these are just educated guesses.
