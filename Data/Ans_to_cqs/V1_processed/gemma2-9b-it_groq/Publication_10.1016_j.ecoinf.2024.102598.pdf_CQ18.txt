The text describes a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) strategy for monitoring model performance during training. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Data Split:** The forest fire occurrence data is divided into 10 equal parts.

2. **Training and Validation:** In each iteration of the 10-fold CV, 70% of the data is used for training the model, while the remaining 30% is reserved as a validation set.

3. **Model Generation:** This process is repeated 10 times, with each of the 10 data subsets serving as the validation set once. This results in 10 different models.

4. **Performance Evaluation:** The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like AUC, TSS, kappa, and phi on the corresponding validation set.

5. **Averaging Results:** The performance results from all 10 iterations are averaged to provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.



This rigorous validation methodology helps to ensure that the models are generalizable and perform well on unseen data.
