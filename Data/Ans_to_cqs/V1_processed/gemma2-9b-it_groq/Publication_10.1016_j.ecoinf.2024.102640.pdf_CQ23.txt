To improve the generalizability of the deep learning model in GreenCam, the researchers took several measures:

* **Diverse Dataset:** The model was trained on a customized dataset that encompassed a wide range of urban settings, including different types of green spaces and varying levels of urban green density. This helps the model learn to recognize green spaces in diverse environments.

* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images were implemented during dataset construction. This artificial increase in data diversity helps the model generalize better and prevents overfitting to specific image characteristics.

* **Future Expansion:** The researchers plan to further expand the dataset to include photos from different cities and climates, as well as images captured across all seasons. This will expose the model to a broader range of urban environmental conditions and enhance its generalizability.
