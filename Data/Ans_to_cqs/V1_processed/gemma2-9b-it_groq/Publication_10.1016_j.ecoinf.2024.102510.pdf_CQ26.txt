The provided text focuses on the impact of imbalanced datasets on deep learning models and the use of data augmentation to improve performance.  While it mentions the importance of diverse datasets, it doesn't delve into specific preprocessing techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I can only say that collecting more comprehensive and diverse datasets is crucial to mitigate data bias.  The text doesn't provide information on other techniques you mentioned.
