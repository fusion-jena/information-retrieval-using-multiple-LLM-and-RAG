The provided text states that the GRU-DNN model  "uses the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function, which is provided by equation (5). That is, the proposed GRU-DNN model is trained with the goal of minimizing the loss function given a training data observations. "

It also mentions that "the proposed model hyperparameters is a part of machine learning methods. "

However, the specific optimization techniques (e.g., SGD, Adam) used to train the model are **not mentioned** in the given context.
