The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It focuses on comparing the performance of an LSTM model and a VR + SVR model, highlighting the VR + SVR's ability to handle missing data. 

There is no mention of techniques like data diversification, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
