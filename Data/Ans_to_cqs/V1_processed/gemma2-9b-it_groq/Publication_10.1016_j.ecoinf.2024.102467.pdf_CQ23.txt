The provided text focuses on describing the architecture and efficiency of different deep learning models (Xception, R-FCN, EfficientNetV2) and doesn't offer details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of any particular model. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
