While the provided text describes the Mask R-CNN model and its training process, it doesn't specify the exact criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. 

Data splitting for deep learning is a common practice and there are several approaches:

* **Percentage-based Split:** The most common method is to divide the data into percentages, for example, 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. 

* **Stratified Split:** This method ensures that the proportion of different classes in the dataset is maintained in each split. This is important when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

* **Time-based Split:** For time-series data, the data can be split based on time, using a chronological order.

The specific criteria used depend on factors like the size of the dataset, the nature of the problem, and the desired balance between model performance and generalization ability.
