The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (SLSTM).  It only mentions that the model's performance was evaluated using MAPE and RMSE metrics and compared to other models like ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, and SLSTM. 


There is no information about data splitting techniques (like cross-validation or stratified splitting) or the diversity of the dataset used for training and evaluation.
