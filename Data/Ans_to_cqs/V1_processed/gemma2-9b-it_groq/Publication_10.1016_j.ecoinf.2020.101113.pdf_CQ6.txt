The provided text focuses on the specific preprocessing steps taken for a CNN model used in analyzing animal calls. It mentions that the input images (spectrograms) need to be of equal size, and a 2-second time-frequency window was chosen. 

While the text doesn't explicitly detail other common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, these are generally important for training deep learning models. 

Normalization and scaling techniques help ensure that the input data has a similar range, which can improve model training stability and performance. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies in the data.
