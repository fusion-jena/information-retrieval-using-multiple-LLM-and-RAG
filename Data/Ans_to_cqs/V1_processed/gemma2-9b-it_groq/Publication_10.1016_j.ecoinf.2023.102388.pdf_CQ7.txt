The provided text describes the data split for a specific scenario involving a target model and an attack model. It doesn't explicitly detail the general criteria used to split data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). 

However, we can infer some common practices based on the description:

* **Training Set (Dtrain):** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the model. The goal is to teach the model to recognize patterns and relationships within the data.

* **Validation Set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to fine-tune hyperparameters. It's a separate subset of the data that the model hasn't seen during training.

* **Test Set:** This set is held out entirely from the training process and is used only once at the end to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance on unseen data.

In general, the data is split into these sets to ensure that the model is:

* **Generalizable:**  It performs well on data it hasn't encountered before.
* **Robust:** It's not overly sensitive to small changes in the data.
* **Evaluated fairly:** The final performance assessment is not influenced by the training data.


The specific proportions of the data allocated to each set can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the specific task.
