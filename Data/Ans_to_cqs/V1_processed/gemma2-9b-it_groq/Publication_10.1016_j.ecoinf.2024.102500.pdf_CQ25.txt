The provided text focuses on describing the process of hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning models, particularly Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost, for predicting water quality parameters like nitrate and dissolved oxygen. 

It doesn't explicitly state the overall purpose or goal of the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what the purpose of the deep learning model is.
