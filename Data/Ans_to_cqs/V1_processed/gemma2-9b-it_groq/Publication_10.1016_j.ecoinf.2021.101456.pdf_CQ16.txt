The provided text focuses on the dynamic adjustment of the β parameter in a β-VAE model and doesn't explicitly state the criteria for determining the completion of training. 

It does mention that the β value is adjusted based on the changes in reconstruction and regularization losses throughout the training process.  Specifically:

*  β is increased if the regularization loss increases above a historical minimum.
*  β is decreased if the reconstruction loss increases above a historical minimum.

The text also illustrates how β fluctuates during training, eventually stabilizing around epoch 2000 in the example shown.

However, it doesn't mention other common training completion criteria like validation loss plateau, epoch limit, or a specific target loss value.
