The provided text focuses on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, particularly their applications in sequential data processing. It doesn't delve into data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines. 

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are primarily used for image data to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. This helps improve the model's generalization ability and performance. 

While the text doesn't mention these techniques, they are fundamental concepts in computer vision and deep learning.
