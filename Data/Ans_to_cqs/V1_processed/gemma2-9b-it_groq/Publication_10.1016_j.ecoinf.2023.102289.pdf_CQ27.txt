The provided text describes the LaDeco platform's functionality and underlying components but doesn't explicitly detail the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. 

We know LaDeco uses the deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269 model by default. This model is likely pre-trained and readily available through the GluonCV library, as mentioned in section 2.3. 

However, the text doesn't specify:

* **Model Serialization:** Whether the model is saved in a specific format (e.g., ONNX, HDF5) for later use.
* **Platform Selection:**  The exact steps taken to choose and set up the computational environment (CPU or GPU) and the MXNet framework for running the model.
* **Deployment Details:**  How the model is integrated into the LaDeco platform's workflow, including data input, processing, and output generation. 



Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively answer the query about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
