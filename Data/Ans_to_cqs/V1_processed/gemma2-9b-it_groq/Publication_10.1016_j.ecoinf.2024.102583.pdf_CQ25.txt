The provided text focuses on XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, and mentions other algorithms like Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks in the context of landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM). 

However, it doesn't explicitly state the purpose of deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) within LSM. 

Based on common applications of these models in computer vision, it's likely they are used for **segmentation** or **detection** tasks in LSM. This could involve:

* **Segmenting** landslide-prone areas from satellite imagery.
* **Detecting** potential landslides in real-time using sensor data. 


It's important to note that this is an inference based on general knowledge about deep learning and the context of landslide modeling. The text itself doesn't confirm this.
