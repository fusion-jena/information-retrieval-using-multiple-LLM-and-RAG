The provided text focuses on comparing hyperparameter optimization approaches for a deep neural network (DNN) used in land cover/land use classification.  

While it mentions the use of deep neural networks and hyperparameter optimization, it doesn't specify the exact hyperparameters used in the DNN model. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the specific hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, optimizer) employed in the deep learning model described in the context.
