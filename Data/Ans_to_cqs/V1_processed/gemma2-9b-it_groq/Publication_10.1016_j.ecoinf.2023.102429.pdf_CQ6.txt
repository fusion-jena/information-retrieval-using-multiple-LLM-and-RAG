The provided text focuses on spectral analysis and pre-processing techniques in the context of soil nutrient concentration analysis, primarily mentioning methods like R/PLSR, SG/PLSR, and variations thereof. It doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps typically involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.
* **Cleaning:** Handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal), removing outliers, and transforming categorical data into numerical representations. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
