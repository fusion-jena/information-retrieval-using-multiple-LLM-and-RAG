The provided text focuses on the applications of deep learning in ecological research, particularly using camera trap images. It doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on general knowledge of machine learning practices, here are some common techniques used to mitigate data bias:

* **Stratified Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets while proportionally maintaining the class distribution present in the original data. This ensures that each subset represents the overall data characteristics.

* **Oversampling:** Increasing the representation of minority classes by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic data points. This helps balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

* **Undersampling:** Reducing the number of samples in the majority class to match the size of the minority class. This can help prevent overfitting to the majority class and improve the model's performance on underrepresented classes.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Actively seeking out and incorporating data from a wide range of sources and perspectives to minimize the impact of biases inherent in a specific dataset.


It's important to note that addressing data bias is an ongoing challenge in machine learning, and the most effective techniques may vary depending on the specific dataset and problem.
