While the provided text discusses the application of deep learning in water quality analysis, it doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on the context, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Hyperspectral imagery:** The paper by Hong et al. (2022) mentions using hyperspectral imagery to estimate cyanobacteria pigments. Hyperspectral sensors capture a wide range of electromagnetic spectrum bands, providing detailed spectral information about the water body.
* **Remote sensing data:** The text refers to Landsat data continuity mission (Irons et al., 2012), suggesting the use of satellite-based remote sensing data for water quality monitoring.
* **In-situ measurements:**  The study by Hwang et al. (2003) focuses on water quality and limnology of Korean reservoirs, implying the use of in-situ measurements (e.g., water samples) to collect water quality parameters.

It's likely that a combination of these methods is employed in a real-world deep learning pipeline for water quality analysis.
