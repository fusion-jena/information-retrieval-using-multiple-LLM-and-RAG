The provided text states that the most common performance evaluation metrics for image classification and object detection are average precision and recall. 

Specifically, the text mentions:

* **Mean Average Precision (mAP):**  This metric combines precision, recall, and a mean value.
* **Precision:**  The ratio of correctly classified positive samples (True Positives) to the total number of classified positive samples (both correct and incorrect).
* **Recall:** The ratio of correctly classified positive samples (True Positives) to the total number of actual positive samples. 

The text also mentions **accuracy** as a metric used by other researchers, but it doesn't provide a definition within the context.
