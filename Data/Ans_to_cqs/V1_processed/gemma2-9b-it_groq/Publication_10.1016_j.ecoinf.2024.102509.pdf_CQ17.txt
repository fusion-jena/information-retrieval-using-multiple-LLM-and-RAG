The provided text focuses on the structure and training of a backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) for a specific application. It doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about dropout and L2 regularization based on the given context.
