The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It mentions using a machine learning ensemble (RandomForest, Treenet, CART, MARS) and  "multi-year field work" to train the model. 

However, it doesn't detail techniques like data splitting (e.g., cross-validation, stratified splitting), dataset diversity strategies, or methods for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, which are all crucial for assessing generalizability.
