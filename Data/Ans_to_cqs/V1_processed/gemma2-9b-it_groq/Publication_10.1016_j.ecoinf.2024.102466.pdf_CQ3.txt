The text describes the use of two main data annotation techniques:

1. **Bounding Box Annotation:** YOLO v7, a pre-trained object detection model, is used to initially predict the bounding boxes around potential birds in the images. This provides a rough outline of the bird's location.

2. **LabelImg Adjustments:**  The bounding boxes and class labels generated by YOLO v7 are further refined using LabelImg. This tool allows manual adjustments to the bounding box boundaries and the classification of bird species. Incorrect identifications are deleted, and coordinates are adjusted for accuracy. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention instance segmentation, which would involve creating a pixel-level mask for each individual bird.
