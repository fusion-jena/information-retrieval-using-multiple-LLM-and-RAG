The provided text focuses on pseudo-labeling techniques in semi-supervised learning for ecological studies and doesn't delve into data bias mitigation during preprocessing. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning pipelines, here are some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target variable classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards certain classes during training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances of underrepresented classes to balance the class distribution in the dataset. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be used to generate synthetic samples for minority classes.

* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from overrepresented classes to balance the class distribution. Care must be taken to avoid removing important information from the majority class.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This is a proactive approach that aims to collect data from a wide range of sources and representative of the target population. This helps minimize bias introduced by sampling limitations.


It's important to note that the choice of technique depends on the specific dataset and the nature of the bias present.
