The text mentions the use of stratified sampling to split the AGB observations into training (70%) and validation (30%) datasets. This technique aims to ensure that the distribution of samples across different classes or groups is maintained in both the training and validation sets. 

While the text doesn't explicitly state the use of other techniques like cross-validation or a diverse dataset, the stratified sampling method itself is a step towards improving the generalizability of the model by preventing overfitting to a specific subset of the data.
