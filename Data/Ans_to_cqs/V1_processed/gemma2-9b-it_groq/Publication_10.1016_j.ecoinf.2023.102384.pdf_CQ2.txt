Based on the provided text snippets, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses **image** data. 

Several papers mention image processing techniques, object detection, and computer vision applications in agriculture. For example:

* **Wang et al. (2021)** use images of sticky traps to detect whiteflies and thrips.
* **Zhong et al. (2018)** develop a vision-based counting and recognition system for flying insects.
* **Tian et al. (2020)** review computer vision technology in agricultural automation.
* **Wang et al. (2020)** introduce a dataset of agricultural pests for multi-target detection.

The text also describes techniques like image cropping, augmentation, and patch-based processing, further supporting the use of image data.
