The provided text focuses on object detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and doesn't explicitly mention other data formats used in deep learning. 

However, based on common knowledge, deep learning pipelines can utilize various data formats, including:

* **Image:**  This is a primary data format for computer vision tasks, as discussed in the text.
* **Audio:**  Audio data is used for tasks like speech recognition, music classification, and sound event detection.
* **Video:**  Video data extends image processing to handle sequences of frames, enabling tasks like action recognition and video summarization.
* **Text:**  Text data is processed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and can be used for tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text generation.
* **CSV:**  Comma-separated value (CSV) files are often used to store tabular data, which can be used for supervised learning tasks.
