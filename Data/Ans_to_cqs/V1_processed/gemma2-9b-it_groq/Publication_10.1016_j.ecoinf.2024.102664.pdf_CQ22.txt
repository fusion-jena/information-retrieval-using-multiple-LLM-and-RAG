The provided text mentions two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models:

* **R2 (coefficient of determination):**  This metric indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (chlorophyll concentration) that is explained by the independent variable (the model's predictions). Higher R2 values (closer to 1) indicate better performance.

* **RMSE (root mean squared error):** This metric quantifies the average magnitude of the errors between the model's predictions and the actual chlorophyll concentrations. Lower RMSE values indicate better performance.
