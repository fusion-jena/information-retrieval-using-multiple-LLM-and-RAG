The text describes the use of learning and loss curves to monitor model performance. 

Specifically, it states: "Learning and loss curves were also used to diagnose the learning performance of the three models over time (Fig. 7). The training accuracy curve provides insight into how the model is learning, while the validation accuracy gives insight into the generalizing process. Likewise, the training loss curve shows the model’s performance on the training data when the optimization algorithm adjusts the model parameters to minimize the loss function. The validation loss curve measures the model’s performance on new unseen data." 


These curves allow researchers to observe how well the model is learning from the training data (training accuracy and loss) and how well it generalizes to new, unseen data (validation accuracy and loss).
