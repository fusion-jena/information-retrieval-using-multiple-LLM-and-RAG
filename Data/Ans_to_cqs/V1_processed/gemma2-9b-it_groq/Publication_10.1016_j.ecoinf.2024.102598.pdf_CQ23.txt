The provided text focuses on ensemble modeling using multiple machine learning algorithms, not deep learning.  Therefore, it doesn't describe any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. 

The text does mention the following techniques used for the machine learning models:

* **10-fold cross-validation:** This technique was used to train and validate each model, reserving 30% of the data for validation and 70% for training in each fold. This helps to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Parameter optimization:** The authors used optimized parameters for each model, including setting the number of trees to 500 for the Random Forest algorithm.

While these techniques contribute to building robust models, they are not specific to deep learning and don't directly address the generalizability concerns often associated with deep learning models, which typically require large and diverse datasets.
