The provided text describes the training process and data augmentation techniques used for a deep learning model to classify farm dams.  

However, it doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps performed after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These are not mentioned.
* **Metrics calculation:** While the text mentions an error rate of 0.1538 and a validation loss of 0.4211, it doesn't specify other common metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score.
* **Confusion matrix:** The text states that a confusion matrix was generated for farm dam detection (Figure S1 in the Supplementary Materials), but it doesn't describe its contents or how it was used. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm the calculation of error rate and validation loss and the creation of a confusion matrix.
