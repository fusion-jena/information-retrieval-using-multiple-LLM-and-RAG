The provided text focuses on the model building process, hyperparameter optimization, and performance evaluation using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R2.  

It does not, however, mention any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the dataset's diversity (e.g., geographical coverage, temporal range) is lacking.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to assess model performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting to maintain the class distribution in the training and testing sets. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
