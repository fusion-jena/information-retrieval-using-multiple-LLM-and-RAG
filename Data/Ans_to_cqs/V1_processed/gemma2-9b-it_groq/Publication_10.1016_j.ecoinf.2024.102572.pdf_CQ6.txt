The provided text focuses on land use, land cover, and forest fire analysis using satellite imagery and geospatial data processing techniques within Google Earth Engine (GEE). It doesn't delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance. This could involve combining features, transforming them, or extracting relevant information.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., text labels) into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand. Common techniques include one-hot encoding or label encoding.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to improve model robustness. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
