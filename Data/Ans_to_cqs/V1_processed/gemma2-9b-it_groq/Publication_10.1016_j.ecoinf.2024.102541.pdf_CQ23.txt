The provided text states that the model was evaluated across "three datasets, representing a range of domains, problems, species, and environmental conditions." This suggests an attempt to ensure generalizability by using diverse datasets. 

However, the text does not mention specific techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether these methods were used.
