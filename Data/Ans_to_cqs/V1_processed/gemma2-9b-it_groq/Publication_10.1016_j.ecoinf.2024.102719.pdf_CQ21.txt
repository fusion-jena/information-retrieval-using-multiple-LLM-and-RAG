The provided text focuses on the model training process, particularly the bias-variance decomposition technique used to evaluate model performance. It doesn't delve into post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about post-processing steps.
