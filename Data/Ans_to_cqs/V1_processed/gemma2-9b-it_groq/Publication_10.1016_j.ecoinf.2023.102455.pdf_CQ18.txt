The provided text does not contain information about the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It lists various machine learning models (e.g., MVMD-KELM, CNN-BiRNN), performance metrics (R, RMSE, MAPE), and terms related to model evaluation (Nashâ€“Sutcliffe model efficiency, Correlation Coefficient, etc.). However, it doesn't describe the methods used to track performance during the training process itself.
