The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning to analyze existing aerial imagery for ecosystem monitoring. It doesn't specify the methods used for initially collecting the raw aerial imagery data.  

Therefore, I cannot answer what methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
