The provided text describes a four-fold cross-validation technique used for training a deep learning model.  

In this specific case, the dataset is divided into four mutually exclusive folds through stratified sampling. Each fold serves as the validation set once, while the remaining three folds constitute the training set.  

The text doesn't explicitly state criteria for a general train/test/validation split, but it implies that stratified sampling is used to ensure representation of different classes within each fold. 

It's common practice to split data into these sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the model.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** Used for a final evaluation of the trained model's performance on unseen data.
