The provided text lists the hyperparameters used in various machine learning models, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks. 

However, it does not specify the exact hyperparameters used for the deep learning model.  We only know that the deep learning model has hyperparameters such as:

* **Hidden layer sizes**
* **Activation**
* **Solver**
* **Alpha**
* **Learning rate**
