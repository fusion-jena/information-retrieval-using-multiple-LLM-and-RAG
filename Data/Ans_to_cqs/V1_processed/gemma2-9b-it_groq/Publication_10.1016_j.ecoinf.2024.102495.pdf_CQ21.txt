The provided text describes the process of training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for mosquito classification using audio recordings. It details various aspects of the model, including architecture, hyperparameters, and performance evaluation. 

However, it doesn't explicitly list the post-processing steps involved after model training. 

Based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer some likely post-processing steps:

* **Metrics Calculation:**  The text mentions calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These are standard metrics for evaluating classification models.
* **Confusion Matrix:** The text presents a confusion matrix (Table 5) which is a common tool for visualizing the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
* **Saliency Maps:** The text doesn't mention saliency maps, but these are often used to visualize which parts of the input (in this case, the audio) are most influential in the model's decision.

It's possible that other post-processing steps were performed, such as:

* **Thresholding:** Adjusting the decision threshold to optimize a specific metric (e.g., precision or recall).
* **Ensemble Methods:** Combining predictions from multiple trained models to improve overall performance.
* **Data Augmentation:** Applying transformations to the audio data (e.g., noise addition, time stretching) to further improve the model's robustness.



Without explicit information from the text, we can only speculate on the complete set of post-processing steps.
