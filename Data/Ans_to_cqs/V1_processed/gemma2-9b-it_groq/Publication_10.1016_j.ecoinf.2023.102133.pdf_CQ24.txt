The provided text focuses on Random Forests, a machine learning technique, and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

However, I can offer some general strategies used in deep learning to manage randomness:

* **Random Seed Initialization:**  Setting a random seed ensures that the initial weights of the neural network are the same every time you run the training process. This reproducibility is crucial for comparing results and debugging.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to the input data.

* **Weight Initialization:**  Using specific initialization schemes (e.g., Xavier or He initialization) to initialize weights in a way that promotes faster and more stable training.
