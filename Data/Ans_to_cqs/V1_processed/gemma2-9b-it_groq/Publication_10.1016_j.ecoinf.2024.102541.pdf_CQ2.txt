Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes **image** data. 

Several papers mention object detection tasks, which heavily rely on image input. For example:

* **Liu, W., et al., 2016. SSD: single shot MultiBox detector.** This paper focuses on object detection using images.
* **Schneider, S., Taylor, G.W., Kremer, S., Dec. 2018. Deep learning object detection methods for ecological camera trap data.** This paper applies deep learning for object detection in camera trap images.
* **Dong, X., Yan, S., Duan, C., Aug. 2022. A lightweight vehicles detection network model** This paper deals with vehicle detection, which involves image data.

While the context primarily focuses on image data, there are hints towards other formats:

* **Schindler, F., Steinhage, V., Mar. 2021. Identification of animals and recognition of their actions in wildlife videos using deep learning techniques.** This paper suggests the use of **video** data for animal identification and action recognition.
* **Anders, F., Kalan, A.K., KÃ¼hl, H.S., Fuchs, M., Nov. 2021. Compensating class imbalance for acoustic chimpanzee detection with convolutional recurrent neural networks.** This paper mentions the use of **audio** data for chimpanzee detection.



It's important to note that the context doesn't explicitly state the specific data formats used in all mentioned papers.
