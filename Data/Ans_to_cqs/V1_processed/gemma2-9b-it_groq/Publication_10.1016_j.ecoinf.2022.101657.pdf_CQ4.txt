The provided text does not specify the exact data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for species identification in camera trap images. 

While it mentions the use of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation, it doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps applied to the images before training the model. 

Common data augmentation techniques used in computer vision tasks like this include:

* **Flipping:** Horizontally or vertically flipping images to increase dataset size and improve model robustness to image orientation.
* **Rotation:** Rotating images by a certain angle to make the model invariant to slight rotations.
* **Scaling:**  Resizing images to different proportions while maintaining aspect ratio.
* **Color Jitter:**  Randomly adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue to introduce variations in image appearance.

However, without explicit information from the cited research, we cannot confirm which of these techniques (or others) were employed in this specific deep learning pipeline.
