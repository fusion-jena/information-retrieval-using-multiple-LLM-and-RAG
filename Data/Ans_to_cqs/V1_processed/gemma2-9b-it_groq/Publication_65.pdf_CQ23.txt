The text mentions data augmentation techniques like rotation, noise, and flipping were used to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's robustness and generalization ability.  

It also states that the learning rate was reduced using an SGD scheduler after 50,000 iterations to prevent overfitting. 

However, the text does not specify if a diverse dataset was used, cross-validation was employed, or stratified splitting was applied.
