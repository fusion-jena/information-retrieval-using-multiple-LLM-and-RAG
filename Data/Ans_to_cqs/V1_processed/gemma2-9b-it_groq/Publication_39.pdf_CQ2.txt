The provided text states that the input to the ResNet networks is in the form "3 × T × H × W".  Here, 3 represents the three color channels (RGB), T is the number of frames in a video clip, and H and W are the height and width of the image.  

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline uses **video** data format.
