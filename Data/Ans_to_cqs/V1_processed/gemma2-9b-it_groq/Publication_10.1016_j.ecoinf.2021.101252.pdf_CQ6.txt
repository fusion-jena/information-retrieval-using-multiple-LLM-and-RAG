The provided text focuses on AutoML procedures and doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data (e.g., text, labels) into numerical representations suitable for deep learning models.

The specific preprocessing steps used depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
