The hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model are optimized using the IKHO algorithm.  This algorithm is a combination of the KH algorithm (which is inspired by the swarming behavior of krill) and a free search (FS) operator. The FS operator helps to avoid the local optima problem that can occur with the KH algorithm.
