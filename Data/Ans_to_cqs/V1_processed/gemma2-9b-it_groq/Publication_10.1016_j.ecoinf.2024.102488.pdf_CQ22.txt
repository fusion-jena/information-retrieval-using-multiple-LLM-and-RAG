The provided text focuses on a feature selection process using a Random Forest algorithm (RFECV) and ensemble methods with various base models (TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, TLightGBM) for classification.  

It mentions the calculation of "cross-validation accuracy" as a metric to evaluate the performance of the model.  

However, the text does not explicitly list other common classification metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score.
