Based on the provided text, the following methods are mentioned for collecting raw data used in deep learning pipelines:

* **Surveys:**  The text mentions surveys of breeding penguins and other seabirds conducted in Antarctica (Shuford and Spear, 1988). 
* **Drone Imagery:**  Several studies utilize drone imagery for animal counting and habitat analysis (Weimerskirch et al., 2018; Wood et al., 2021; Tovar-SÂ´anchez et al., 2021; Le et al., 2022).
* **Satellite Imagery:**  An object-based image analysis approach using very high spatial resolution satellite images is mentioned for detecting penguin guano (Witharana and Lynch, 2016).
* **Citizen Science:**  The text highlights the use of citizen scientists in collecting data on Weddell seal habitat affinity (Stammerjohn and Barrington, 2020). 


It's important to note that the text focuses on specific applications in Antarctic research and might not represent the full range of data collection methods used in deep learning pipelines across all domains.
