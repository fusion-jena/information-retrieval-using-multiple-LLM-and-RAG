The provided text states that an early stop approach is used to determine when training is complete. 

This approach monitors the performance of the model on a validation dataset. If the performance fails to improve beyond a predefined threshold for a set number of iterations (patience value of 16 in this case), the training process is halted. 

This prevents overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data, and conserves computational resources.
