The provided text focuses on deep learning applications for fish detection and size monitoring, but it doesn't explicitly detail the raw data collection methods used in the specific studies cited. 

However, we can infer some possibilities based on the context:

* **Underwater Video Footage:**  Several papers mention using underwater video devices for fish observation and size measurement (Coro and Walsh, 2021; Palmer et al., 2021). This suggests that video recordings likely serve as a primary data source.
* **Public Datasets:** The mention of "targeted fish species dataset" implies the existence of pre-existing datasets containing fish images or videos, potentially publicly available.
* **Surveys:** While not directly stated, research on fish consumption and sale by artisanal fishers (da Cunha et al., 2023) might involve surveys or interviews gathering data on fish species caught.

Without further information from the cited sources, it's impossible to definitively list all the data collection methods employed.
