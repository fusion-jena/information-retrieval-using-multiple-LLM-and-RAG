The provided text mentions that the study used Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) to evaluate the performance of the models, including the Deep Neural Network (DNN).  

It states: "Examining the other models in the study offers a broad view of their relative performances. Models like the Random Forest Regressor, Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Bagging Regressor exhibited moderate performances. Their MSE values ranged from 1001.27 to 1025.74, and R2 values hovered around the 0.6 mark. On the other end of the spectrum, models such as the Deep Neural Network, XGBoost Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor showed lower effectiveness, with MSE values exceeding 1100 and R2 values dipping below 0.55."
