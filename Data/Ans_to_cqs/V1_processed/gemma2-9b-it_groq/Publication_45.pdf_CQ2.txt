The provided text focuses on using deep learning for ecological prediction, specifically for modeling bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests.  

While it doesn't explicitly state the data formats used, it heavily implies the use of **image data**. 

Here's why:

* **"bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests"**: This suggests visual data of forest areas, potentially including aerial imagery or satellite data, would be used to identify outbreak patterns.
* **"DNNs for ecological prediction"**:  Deep neural networks are particularly effective at processing image data due to their ability to learn complex spatial patterns.


It's possible that other data formats like **CSV** (for environmental variables, forest management practices, etc.) are also incorporated, but the primary focus seems to be on image-based analysis.
