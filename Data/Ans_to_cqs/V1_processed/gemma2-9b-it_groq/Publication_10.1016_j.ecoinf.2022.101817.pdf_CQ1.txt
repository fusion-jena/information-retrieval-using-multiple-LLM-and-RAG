The provided text snippets do not explicitly describe the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. 

The papers focus on:

* **ImageNet:** A large-scale hierarchical image database used for training and evaluating computer vision models. It's likely the images in ImageNet were collected from various sources like the web, public repositories, and possibly through organized data collection efforts.
* **Freshwater Biodiversity Monitoring:** This paper discusses using digital technology and citizen science for monitoring freshwater biodiversity during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The data collection methods likely involve photographs or videos taken by citizen scientists.
* **Deep Fusion for Motion Segmentation:** This paper focuses on a specific deep learning model for motion segmentation and doesn't delve into data collection methods.

To determine the specific data collection methods used in each case, you would need to consult the full papers or additional sources.
