The provided text focuses on the methodology of a specific study using deep learning for semantic segmentation of fuel types in forest environments. It doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for image data used in deep learning typically include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant information from the images. This might involve techniques like removing dust spots, smoothing edges, or cropping out unwanted portions.
* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. This helps improve model training stability and convergence.
* **Resizing:** Adjusting image dimensions to a consistent size required by the deep learning model.
* **Augmentation:** Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, cropping, and color adjustments. This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the dataset, the deep learning model, and the specific task.
