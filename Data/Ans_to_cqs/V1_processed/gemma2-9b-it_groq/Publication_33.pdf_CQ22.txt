The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning model:

* **Accuracy:**  This is the most commonly used metric, representing the percentage of correct predictions made by the model. The text states that the proposed post-processing method was able to increase the accuracy for all three goals (G1, G2, and G3).

* **Misclassification rate:** This metric measures the percentage of incorrect predictions made by the model. The text states that the post-processing method was able to decrease the misclassification rate by at least 10.05% for all goals. 


The text does not explicitly mention precision or recall.
