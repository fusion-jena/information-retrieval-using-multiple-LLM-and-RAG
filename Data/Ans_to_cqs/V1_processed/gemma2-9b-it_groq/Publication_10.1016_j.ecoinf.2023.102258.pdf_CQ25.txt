The provided text focuses on the challenges and approaches to using deep learning for bioacoustic event detection.  

While it doesn't explicitly state the *purpose* of the deep learning models discussed, we can infer it's primarily **detection**. 

Here's why:

* **Focus on Annotation:** The text emphasizes the need for annotated audio examples, specifically mentioning "temporally-precise and fine-grained annotation of audio" for "sound events of interest." This suggests the goal is to identify and locate specific sound events within audio recordings.
* **Mention of "Detection Challenge":** The text references the "first bird audio detection challenge," further pointing towards the task of detecting specific sound events (birds in this case).
* **Discussion of Post-Processing:** The text highlights the importance of post-processing outputs to handle events spanning multiple audio chunks, a common technique in detection tasks.


Therefore, based on the context, the deep learning models discussed are likely designed for **bioacoustic event detection**.
