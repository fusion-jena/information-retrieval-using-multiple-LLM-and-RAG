The provided text describes a deep learning model called CNN-BiGRU for streamflow forecasting.  It lists several hyperparameters used in this model:

* **CNN Layers:** The number of convolutional layers in the CNN part of the model.
* **BiGRU Layers:** The number of Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers.
* **BiGRU neurons:** The number of neurons in each BiGRU layer.
* **kernel_size:** The size of the convolutional kernel used in the CNN layers.
* **filters:** The number of filters used in each convolutional layer.
* **Optimizer:** The optimization algorithm used to train the model. In this case, it's Adam.
* **activation function:** The activation function used in the model. Here, it's 'relu'.
* **epochs:** The number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the model.
* **batch_size:** The number of samples processed in each training iteration.
* **learning_rate:**  A parameter that controls the step size during weight updates.


The text also mentions hyperparameters used in other models compared to CNN-BiGRU, such as KELM and RVFL, including kernel parameters and regularization coefficients.
