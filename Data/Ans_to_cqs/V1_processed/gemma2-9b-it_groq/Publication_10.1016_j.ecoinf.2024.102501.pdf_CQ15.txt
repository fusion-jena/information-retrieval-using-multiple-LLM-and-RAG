The provided text focuses on optimization techniques used for model parameter problems in the context of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration prediction, not specifically within deep learning pipelines. 

It mentions genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the multi-verse optimizer as techniques used for parameter optimization. However, it doesn't delve into optimization algorithms commonly used in deep learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop.
