The provided text focuses on machine learning models like Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, but it doesn't specify the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation in deep learning. 

Generally, in deep learning, data is split into these sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and fine-tune hyperparameters. 
* **Test set:** Used only once at the end of training to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

The specific split ratios (e.g., 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test) can vary depending on the dataset size and the specific deep learning task.
