The text describes several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

* **Stratified sampling:** This technique is used to ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets have a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset. This helps to prevent overfitting to the majority class and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

* **Data augmentation:** This involves applying random transformations to the existing data to increase its diversity. The text mentions two specific augmentation techniques:
    * **Random spectrogram mixup:** This technique combines two spectrograms with their corresponding labels to create a new spectrogram.
    * **Random tanh distortion:** This technique applies a random hyperbolic tangent distortion to the spectrograms.

* **Targeted augmentation for rare species:**  To address the issue of a long-tailed distribution (where some bird species are much less represented than others), the authors used additional data augmentation techniques specifically for rare and endangered species. These techniques include adding background noise, random clipping, and splicing. 



The text does not explicitly mention oversampling or undersampling techniques.
