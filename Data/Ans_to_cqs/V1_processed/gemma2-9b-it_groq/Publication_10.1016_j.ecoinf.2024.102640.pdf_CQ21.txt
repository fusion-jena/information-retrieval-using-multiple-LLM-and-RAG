The provided text focuses on the architecture and training of the GreenCam system, particularly its eye-level shot detection and Green View Index (GVI) estimation.  It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency map generation, metric calculations, or confusion matrix construction. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
