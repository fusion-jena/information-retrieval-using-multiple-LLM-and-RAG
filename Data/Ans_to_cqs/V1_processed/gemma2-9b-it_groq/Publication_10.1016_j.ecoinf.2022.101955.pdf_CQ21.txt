The provided text focuses on the model training process and parameter tuning for four different ML algorithms (kNN, SVM, ANN, and another unspecified algorithm).  

It doesn't describe any post-processing steps performed *after* model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which input features are most influential in the model's predictions.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  A table showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing a detailed view of classification performance. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
