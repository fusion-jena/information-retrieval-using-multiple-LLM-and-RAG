The provided text focuses on the technical details of the MU-NET model and its training process. It doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used for preparing the training dataset. 

While the text mentions semantic segmentation as the applied technique for assigning category labels to each pixel, it doesn't elaborate on how these labels were created. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what specific data annotation techniques (like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation) were used.
