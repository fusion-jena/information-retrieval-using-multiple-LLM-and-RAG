The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to predict total phosphorus concentration in rivers and doesn't delve into specific data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation based on the given context.
