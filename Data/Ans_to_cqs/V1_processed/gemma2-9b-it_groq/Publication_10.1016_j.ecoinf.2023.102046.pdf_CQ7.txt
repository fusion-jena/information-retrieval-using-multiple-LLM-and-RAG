The provided text doesn't specify the exact criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation.  

It does mention that the model with the smallest validation loss was used for evaluation on the test set. This implies the existence of a validation set used to monitor model performance during training and select the best performing model. 

However, the exact proportions of the dataset allocated to each split (train, validation, test) are not provided.
