The provided text focuses on a study using machine learning algorithms to predict aboveground biomass. It mentions the use of spectral bands from remote sensing data and SRTM DEM data.  

While it discusses machine learning, it doesn't specify the exact data formats used in a "deep learning pipeline."  

Based on the context, it's likely that image data (from satellite imagery) and potentially elevation data (from the SRTM DEM) are involved.  However, the text doesn't explicitly confirm this.
