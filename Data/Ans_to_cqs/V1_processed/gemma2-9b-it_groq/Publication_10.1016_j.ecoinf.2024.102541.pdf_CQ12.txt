Based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. 

Several clues point to this conclusion:

* **"Dense convolutional neural networks"** is explicitly mentioned in the paper by Tiwari et al. (2021).
*  The text discusses **"deep convolutional neural network"** in the context of wild animal detection (Verma & Gupta, 2018).
*  The references to **Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet** (Szegedy et al., 2017) further solidify this, as these are well-known CNN architectures.


While other deep learning models like RNNs or Transformers are mentioned in the context, the primary focus and descriptions clearly indicate the use of CNNs.
