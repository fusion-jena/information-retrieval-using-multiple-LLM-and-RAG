The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning model (LSTM) for forecasting ecological water demand and doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. Common techniques include standardization (z-score normalization) and min-max scaling.
* **Normalization:**  Scaling features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to improve model performance.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.
* **Data Splitting:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets to train the model, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
