The text explicitly states that a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** is used in the pipeline.  

This is mentioned in the section titled "2.2.4. Convolutional network" where it describes CNNs as an algorithm type or neural network model commonly used to process data with high complexity, such as images or sound data.
