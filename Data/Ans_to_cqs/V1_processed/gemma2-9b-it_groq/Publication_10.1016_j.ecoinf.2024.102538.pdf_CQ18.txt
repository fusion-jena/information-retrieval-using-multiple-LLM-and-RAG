The provided text states that the model's performance was monitored using the validation loss. 

Specifically, it mentions:  "The learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs." 


This indicates that the validation loss was tracked during training, and if it plateaued for a certain number of epochs, the learning rate was decreased to help the model continue learning.
