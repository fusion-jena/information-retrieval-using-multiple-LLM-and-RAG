The provided text focuses on the development and application of a deep learning model for fish biomass estimation. While it mentions the use of a deep learning technique for head and mouth detection in Southern Bluefin tuna, it doesn't delve into the specific data annotation techniques employed in the training process. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques were used for training the deep learning pipeline.
