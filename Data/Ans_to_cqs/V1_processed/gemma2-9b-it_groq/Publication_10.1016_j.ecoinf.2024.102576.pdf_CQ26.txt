The provided text focuses on using deep learning for land use and land cover change detection, particularly with Phenological Characteristics Features (PCF) and doesn't delve into specific data bias mitigation techniques during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about techniques used to address data bias (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) based on the given context.
