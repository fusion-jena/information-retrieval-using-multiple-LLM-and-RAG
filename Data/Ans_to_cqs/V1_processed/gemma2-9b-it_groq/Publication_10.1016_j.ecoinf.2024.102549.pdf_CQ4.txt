The provided text does not specify the exact data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.  While it mentions the use of a CNN model (AlexNet) for water quality monitoring, it doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps applied to the data. 

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in image processing to increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve the performance of deep learning models. However, without information from the study itself, we cannot confirm if these techniques were employed.
