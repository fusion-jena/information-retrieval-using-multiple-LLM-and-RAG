The provided text focuses on the methodology used to build a machine learning model for predicting forest fire occurrence. It doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model (if one was used). 

The text mentions using various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, but it doesn't delve into the specifics of whether a deep learning model was employed. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine the purpose of the deep learning model.
