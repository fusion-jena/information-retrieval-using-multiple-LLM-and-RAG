The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (CNN).  It does mention that the model was trained and validated using two independent data sets (ABMI plots and CCMEO) and that the performance was evaluated using overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, and mean F1-score. 

However, it does not provide details about data splitting techniques (e.g., stratified splitting, cross-validation), the diversity of the training data, or any other steps taken to address potential biases or overfitting.
