The provided text describes the parameter optimization process for the SVM model. It states that a grid search was performed by testing various values for the "gamma" and "cost" parameters.  

The optimal values for these parameters were selected based on the highest overall accuracy achieved. 

The text does not mention the optimization method used for the SAE classifier.
