The provided text focuses on machine learning algorithms for animal behavior analysis and doesn't delve into the specifics of data splitting criteria for deep learning models. 

To answer your query about data splitting for deep learning, here's a general explanation:

Deep learning models, like other machine learning models, require training data to learn patterns and make predictions.  Data is typically split into three sets:

* **Training set:** The largest portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns the relationships between input features and output labels from this set.
* **Validation set:** A smaller subset used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps prevent overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data.
* **Test set:**  Held out entirely from the training process. It's used only once at the end to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on completely new data.

The exact proportions of these sets can vary, but a common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. 

The choice of splitting criteria often depends on the size and nature of the dataset.
