The provided text focuses on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in various fields like remote sensing and agroforestry. It doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can offer some general strategies commonly used to address randomness in deep learning:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  As you mentioned, specifying a random seed ensures that the initialization of weights and other random processes within the deep learning framework are reproducible. This allows for consistent results across multiple runs and facilitates debugging.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data samples can help mitigate the impact of randomness in the data itself.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features that are not reliant on any single neuron.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer during training, reducing internal covariate shift and stabilizing the learning process.

Keep in mind that some randomness is inherent in deep learning due to the stochastic nature of gradient descent optimization.
