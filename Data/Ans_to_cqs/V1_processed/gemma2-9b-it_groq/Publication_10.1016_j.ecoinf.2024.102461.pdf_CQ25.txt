The provided text focuses on using deep learning and other machine learning algorithms to create fire risk maps in forest ecosystems.  

While it mentions deep learning as a potential technique, it doesn't specify the exact type of deep learning model used or its purpose within the fire risk mapping process. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively say what specific purpose the deep learning model serves (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection).
