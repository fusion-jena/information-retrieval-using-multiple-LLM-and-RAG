The data was split into three sets: training, validation, and test. 

* **Test dataset:** 10% of the dataset for each trait was randomly selected and held out for independent evaluation of the trained models. It was not used in the training process.

* **Training dataset:** The remaining data was split into a training dataset and a validation dataset in a 4:1 ratio. This dataset was used to train the weights of the CNN model.

* **Validation dataset:** This dataset was used to monitor the training progress after each full training cycle (epoch). The validation MAE (mean absolute error) was computed after each epoch to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
