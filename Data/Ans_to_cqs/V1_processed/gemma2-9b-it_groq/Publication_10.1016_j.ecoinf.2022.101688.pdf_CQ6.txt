The provided text focuses on using pre-trained CNNs for audio classification and doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for audio data often include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling audio amplitudes to a specific range (e.g., -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Windowing:** Dividing the audio signal into smaller segments (frames) to analyze it in manageable chunks.
* **Feature Extraction:** Transforming the audio frames into numerical representations (e.g., Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms) that capture relevant acoustic information.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like adding noise, changing pitch, or time-stretching to existing audio samples.

The specific preprocessing techniques used depend on the nature of the audio data and the chosen deep learning model.
