The data was split into three sets: training, validation, and testing.  

A systematic approach was used to generate these sets. A grid of sample blocks, each 9 by 9 km, was created with 15 km spacing between blocks.  These blocks were then assigned as training, validation, or test sets. 

For the test set, a column was randomly selected from the grid, and every fourth column from that selection was added. Only every second row from the selected columns was included in the test set. 

The final distribution of the data was:

* **Training:** 39,520 samples (60%)
* **Validation:** 23,934 samples (30%)
* **Test:** 6,509 samples (10%)
