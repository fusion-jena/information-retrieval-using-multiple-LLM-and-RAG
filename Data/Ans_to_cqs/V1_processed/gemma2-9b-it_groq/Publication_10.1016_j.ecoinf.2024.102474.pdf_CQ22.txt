The provided text states that the following metrics are used to evaluate the deep learning model:

* **MAD (Mean Absolute Difference)**
* **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**
* **EMD (Earth Mover's Distance)**
* **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)**

These metrics are all transformed and normalized such that higher values indicate better model performance.  The **ENS score**, which is the harmonic mean of these four metrics, is also maximized to represent the overall model performance.
