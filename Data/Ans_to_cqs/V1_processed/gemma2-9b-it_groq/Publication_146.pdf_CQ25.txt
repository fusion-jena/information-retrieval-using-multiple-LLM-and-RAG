The purpose of the deep learning model described in the text is **object detection**. 

The text explicitly states: "The YoloV3 algorithm implemented in this study is based on Darknet-53, a 53-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual connections. ... Yolo is a single stage detector that does not need to divide the image into separate regions, but instead handles the full image at once and hence the name: You Only Look Once. This is achieved by creating feature maps consisting of grid cells through a 3 level pyramid-like structure."
