The provided text describes the use of 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. 

In this strategy, the dataset is divided into ten equal parts (folds). The model is trained nine times, each time using nine folds for training and the remaining fold for testing. This process is repeated, with each fold serving as the test set once. The performance metrics are then averaged across all ten iterations to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.
