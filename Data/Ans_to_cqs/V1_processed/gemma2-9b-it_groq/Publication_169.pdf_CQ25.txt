The purpose of the deep learning model described in the text is **classification**. 

The text states that the model "sorts the plant species images through a fully connected layer to predict whether they belong under any of the 100 categories of the plant species." This clearly indicates a classification task where the model aims to assign input images (plant species) to predefined categories (100 plant species).
