The provided text focuses on the application of Vision Transformers for sika deer identification and doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of features to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:**  Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
