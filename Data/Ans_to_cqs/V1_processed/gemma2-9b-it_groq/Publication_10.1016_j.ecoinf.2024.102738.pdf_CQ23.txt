The provided text focuses on the methodology used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification in the Amazon forest. It details the datasets used, spectral indices calculated, and sampling strategies employed for training and testing the classification model. 

However, the text does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. It primarily discusses a classification approach based on the Random Forest algorithm. 


Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot answer your query about the generalizability of a deep learning model.
