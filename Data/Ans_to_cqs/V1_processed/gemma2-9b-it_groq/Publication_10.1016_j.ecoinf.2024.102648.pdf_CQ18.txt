The text states that "early stopping" was used to monitor the model performance during training.  

Early stopping prevents the model from overfitting the data by halting the addition of more trees/layers/splits when further additions no longer improve the validation statistic. In this case, the R-squared (R2) value was used as the validation statistic for continuous response prediction.
