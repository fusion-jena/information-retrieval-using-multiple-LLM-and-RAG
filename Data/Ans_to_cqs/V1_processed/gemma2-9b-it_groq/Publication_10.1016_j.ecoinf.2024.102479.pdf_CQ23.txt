The text provided describes the use of k-fold cross-validation with a 10-fold design to evaluate the models. It also mentions that the dataset was split into 70% for training and 30% for testing.  

While these techniques contribute to robust model evaluation and help prevent overfitting, the text doesn't explicitly state whether the dataset itself was designed to be diverse.  

Therefore, we can't definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model beyond the use of cross-validation and the train-test split.
