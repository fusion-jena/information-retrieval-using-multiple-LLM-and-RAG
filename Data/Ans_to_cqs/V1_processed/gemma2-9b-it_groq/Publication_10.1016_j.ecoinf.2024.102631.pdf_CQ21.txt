The provided text focuses on the model architecture and training process within a GAN framework. It describes the use of spatial attention and subnetworks for image enhancement but doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency map generation, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
