The provided text focuses on fish detection using deep learning and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  randomness is indeed a common factor in deep learning, often introduced through:

* **Random Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are typically initialized randomly. This prevents symmetry and helps models learn diverse representations.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This popular optimization algorithm uses random mini-batches of data to update model parameters. This introduces noise that can aid in escaping local optima.
* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

**Strategies to Address Randomness:**

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Fixing the random seed ensures that the same random numbers are generated each time you run your code. This allows for reproducibility of results.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) can help mitigate the impact of randomness in the data itself.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Training multiple models with different random initializations and averaging their predictions can reduce the variance introduced by randomness.
