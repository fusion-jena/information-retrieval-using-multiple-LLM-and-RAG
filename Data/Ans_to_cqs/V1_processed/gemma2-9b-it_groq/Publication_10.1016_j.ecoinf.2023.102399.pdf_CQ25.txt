The deep learning model in this context is primarily used for **object detection**. 

The text states that "the use of a deep learning network for high-quality target detection proved crucial in dealing with the complexities of the underwater environment."  

The target being detected is the fish within the underwater images. This detection is essential for accurately estimating the fish biomass.
