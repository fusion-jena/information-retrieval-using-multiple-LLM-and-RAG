Based on the provided text, the deep learning pipeline uses  **image** data. 

The text mentions the use of MODIS Terra MOD11A2 product, which offers infrared radiations measured on channels 31 and 32. These radiations are used to derive the Land Surface Temperature (LST) dataset.  Since MODIS is a satellite sensor, the data it collects is inherently image-based.
