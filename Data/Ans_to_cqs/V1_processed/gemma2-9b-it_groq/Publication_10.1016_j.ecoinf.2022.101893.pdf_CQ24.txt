The provided text focuses on bird song recognition using deep learning and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline.  

To address your query about handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This initializes the random number generator, ensuring that the same "random" values are generated every time you run your code. This is crucial for reproducibility.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing samples. This helps the model generalize better and be less sensitive to small variations in the input data.

* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of each layer during training. This can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of internal covariate shift (changes in the distribution of activations as training progresses).
