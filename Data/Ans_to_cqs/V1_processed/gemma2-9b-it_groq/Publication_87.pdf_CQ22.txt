The text states that three metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance:

* **Accuracy:** The ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.
* **Recall:** A measure of false negatives, calculated as TP / (TP + FN), where TP is the number of true positives and FN is the number of false negatives.
* **Precision:** A measure of false positives, calculated as TP / (TP + FP), where TP is the number of true positives and FP is the number of false positives.
