The provided text focuses on remote sensing data and doesn't mention any deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. 

It describes various Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data batches used in a study, including:

* **Visible bands:** Red, green, and blue bands of Sentinel-2.
* **Microwave (MS) bands:** Twelve MS bands of Sentinel-2.
* **Spectral indices:** Combinations of Sentinel-2 bands to represent specific vegetation properties.
* **Spectral features:**  Derived features from Sentinel-2 data, likely capturing spectral characteristics.
* **Textural features:**  Features describing the spatial patterns in Sentinel-2 data.
* **Sentinel-1 bands:** Data from the Sentinel-1 radar satellite.
* **Digital Surface Model (DSM):** A 3D representation of the Earth's surface. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what deep learning datasets are used in the pipeline.
