The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for biodiversity monitoring and doesn't delve into specific techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as they relate to the deep learning pipeline described in the text.
