The provided text focuses on the process of segmenting audio files for use in a CNN model and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention a few points relevant to randomness:

* **Random data splitting:** The datasets are split into training (60%) and testing (40%) sets by randomly selecting audio files. This introduces randomness in how the data is divided.
* **Random initialization:** The weights in the output layer of the CNN are randomly initialized. This is a common practice in deep learning to break symmetry and allow the network to learn effectively.

To address your query more comprehensively, here are some common strategies used to handle randomness in deep learning:

* **Setting a random seed:**  This ensures that the random number generator starts from the same point each time, making the results reproducible.
* **Using techniques like dropout:** Dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training, preventing overfitting and introducing some randomness.
* **Data augmentation:**  Randomly applying transformations to the data (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) increases the diversity of the training set and reduces the impact of randomness in the data itself.
