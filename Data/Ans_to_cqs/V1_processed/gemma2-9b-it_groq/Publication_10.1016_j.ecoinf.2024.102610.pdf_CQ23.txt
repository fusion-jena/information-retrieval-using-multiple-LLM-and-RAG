The provided text describes the methodology used in a study but doesn't explicitly state the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

The text mentions:

* **Feature elimination and model performance:** This suggests techniques like recursive feature elimination (RFE) were used to select the most relevant features, potentially improving model performance and generalization.
* **Spatial cross-validation:** This technique is used to assess model performance on unseen data and can help ensure the model generalizes well to different spatial locations.
* **Training and spatial mapping:** The text indicates the model was trained and then used for spatial mapping, implying an attempt to apply the model to new areas.

However, the text lacks details about:

* **Dataset diversity:**  Whether the training data represented a diverse range of conditions and locations.
* **Stratified splitting:** Whether the data was split into training and testing sets in a stratified manner to maintain class balance.


Therefore, based on the provided information, we can infer some steps were taken to enhance generalizability, but specific details about data diversity and stratified splitting are missing.
