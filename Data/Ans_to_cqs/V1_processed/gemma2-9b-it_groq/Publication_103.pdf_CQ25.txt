The provided text states that the experiments measured the "top-1 and top-5 accuracy of the trained deep learning model under different circumstances".  

This strongly suggests the purpose of the deep learning model is **classification**.  

Top-1 and top-5 accuracy are standard metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models.
