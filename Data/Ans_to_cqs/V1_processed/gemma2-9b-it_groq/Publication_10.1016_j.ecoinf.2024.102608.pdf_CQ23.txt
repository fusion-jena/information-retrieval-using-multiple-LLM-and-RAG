The provided text focuses on hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning models (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks) and doesn't mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
