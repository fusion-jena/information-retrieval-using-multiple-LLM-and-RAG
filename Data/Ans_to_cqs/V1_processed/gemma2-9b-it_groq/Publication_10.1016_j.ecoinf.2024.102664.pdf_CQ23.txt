The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It focuses on the model's performance evaluation using metrics like POD, HSS, FAR, and RMSE, and compares the performance of different models (CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM) for algal bloom forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. 

The text mentions the use of satellite data for training the model and highlights the model's seasonal variations in performance. However, it does not elaborate on data preprocessing, splitting techniques (like cross-validation or stratified splitting), or strategies for ensuring the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
