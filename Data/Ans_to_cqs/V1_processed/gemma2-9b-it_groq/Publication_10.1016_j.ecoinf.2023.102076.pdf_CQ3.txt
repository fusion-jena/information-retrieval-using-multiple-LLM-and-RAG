The provided text focuses on text classification and doesn't describe data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used for image data. 

The text mentions two main data preparation techniques for text:

1. **Identifying exploitation or sale of a particular taxa:** This involves manually labeling data points as relevant or irrelevant based on the presence of exploitation or sale related to a specific species.

2. **Annotating a randomly selected sample:** Researchers might randomly select data points and label them according to their relevance criteria. 


The text doesn't delve into specific details about the annotation process beyond these high-level descriptions.
