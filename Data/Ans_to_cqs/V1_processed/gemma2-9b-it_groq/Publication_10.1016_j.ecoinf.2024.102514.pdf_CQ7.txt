The provided text describes a data split of 80% for training and 20% for testing. It mentions that this is a common split ratio in machine learning, along with 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%. 

However, the text doesn't explicitly state the criteria used for splitting the data beyond the percentages.  It does mention that 20 random sample locations were selected for training and 10 for testing. 


It's important to note that while the text focuses on a specific study, it doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of data splitting criteria used in deep learning.
