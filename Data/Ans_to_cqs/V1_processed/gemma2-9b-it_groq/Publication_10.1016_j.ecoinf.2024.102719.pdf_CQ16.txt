The provided text describes the process of training and evaluating machine learning models but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

However, it does mention that models were "optimized on the validation set". This suggests that the optimization process likely involved monitoring the performance of the models on the validation set and stopping training when a certain condition is met. 

A common criterion for determining when training is complete is a **plateau in validation loss**.  If the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, it indicates that the model may be overfitting to the training data.
