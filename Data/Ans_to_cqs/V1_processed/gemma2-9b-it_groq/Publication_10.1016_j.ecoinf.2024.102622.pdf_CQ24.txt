The provided text focuses on crop classification and chlorophyll content estimation using remote sensing data and machine learning. It doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes the random number generator, ensuring that the same "random" values are generated every time you run the code. This is crucial for reproducibility.

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing images. This helps the model generalize better and be less sensitive to small variations in the input data.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.
* **Batch normalization:**  Normalizing the activations of each layer in a neural network, which can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of internal covariate shift (changes in the distribution of activations during training).
