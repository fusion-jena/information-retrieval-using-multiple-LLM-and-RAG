The provided text focuses on the Wav2Vec model architecture and training process, particularly its self-supervised learning approach. It doesn't delve into general deep learning preprocessing steps. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) or min-max scaling are used to ensure features have similar scales.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is often necessary for deep learning models.

* **Text Preprocessing (for NLP):** This can include tokenization (breaking text into words or subwords), stemming (reducing words to their root form), and removing stop words (common words with little semantic value). 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of your data and the chosen deep learning model.
