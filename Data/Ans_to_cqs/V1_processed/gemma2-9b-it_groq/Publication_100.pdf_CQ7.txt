The data is split into three sets: training, validation, and test, using a geographical division. 

Each ALS project is divided into horizontal stripes of 900 pixels (9.0 km) wide. Within each stripe:

* The northernmost 5.4 km is used for **training**.
* The next 1.8 km is used for **validation**.
* The southernmost 1.8 km is used for **testing**. 

This method ensures that different regions and modalities within each ALS area are evenly distributed across the three sets.  The overall split follows a "60-20-20" ratio, with 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing.
