The provided text focuses on using deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to enhance the accuracy of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps. It mentions satellite imagery as the data source for training these models. 

While it doesn't explicitly list all methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, we can infer that **satellite imagery** is a primary source in this specific context. 

Generally, deep learning pipelines for various applications can utilize diverse data sources, including:

* **Surveys:**  Structured questionnaires or interviews to gather information.
* **Sensors:** Devices that collect physical measurements (e.g., temperature, pressure, location)
* **Public Datasets:** Collections of data made available by organizations or researchers.
* **Web Scraping:** Extracting data from websites.
* **Text and Audio Data:**  For natural language processing tasks.


The specific methods used depend heavily on the nature of the problem being addressed.
