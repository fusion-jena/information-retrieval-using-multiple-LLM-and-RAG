The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for species identification in ecological communities using camera trap images.  It doesn't delve into the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the data annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) based on the given context.
