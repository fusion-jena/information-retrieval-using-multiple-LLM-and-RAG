The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics:

* **Overall accuracy:** This is the percentage of images correctly classified out of the total number of images.

* **Precision:** For a specific class, precision measures the percentage of images predicted as that class that are actually of that class.

* **Recall:** For a specific class, recall measures the percentage of actual images of that class that are correctly classified.

* **F1-score:** This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
