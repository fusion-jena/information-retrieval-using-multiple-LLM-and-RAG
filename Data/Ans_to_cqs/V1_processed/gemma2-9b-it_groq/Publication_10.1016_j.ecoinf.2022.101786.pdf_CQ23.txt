The text mentions the use of a validation dataset to evaluate the model's performance during training.  

Specifically, it states: "Throughout the training process, the algorithm goes through cycles of training on the training set - evaluating performance on the validation set – adjusting CNN node weights – before repeating the entire cycle."

This process helps to prevent overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data.  

However, the text does not describe the creation of the validation dataset or mention other techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.
