The purpose of the deep learning models described in this text is **classification**. 

The text states: "In this work, we propose deep-learning architectures to classify plant diseases." It goes on to describe various deep learning models and their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, all of which are metrics used to evaluate classification models.
