The provided text focuses on the use of various climate and hydrological datasets for studying groundwater-climate interactions. It mentions datasets like SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index), ENSO (El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation), NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation), and others. 

However, it doesn't specify the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.  Therefore, I cannot answer what data formats are used.
