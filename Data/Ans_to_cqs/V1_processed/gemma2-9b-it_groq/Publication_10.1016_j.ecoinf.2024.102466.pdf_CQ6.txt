The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation of different deep learning models for bird detection using a camera trap dataset. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training these models. 

To answer your query about common preprocessing steps for deep learning models, here are some general techniques:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves removing irrelevant information, such as noise, duplicates, or corrupted data points.

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) helps improve model training stability and convergence.

* **Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the dataset size by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, cropping, and color adjustments. This enhances model robustness and generalization.
* **Labeling:**  Accurately assigning labels to data points (e.g., identifying birds in images) is crucial for supervised learning.

The specific preprocessing steps used depend on the dataset, the chosen deep learning model, and the desired outcome.
