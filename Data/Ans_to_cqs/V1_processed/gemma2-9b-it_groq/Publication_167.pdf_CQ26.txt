The provided text mentions that the training data has an imbalance in the categorical data due to different numbers of samples for each of the five LU suitability categories. 

To address this imbalance, the text states:  "In the training process, a relatively large weight is generated for the categories that have fewer samples, and a small weight is generated for the categories that have more samples, which solves the problem of the performance of the model being poor for the categories that have small sample sizes."

This technique suggests the use of **weighted sampling** during the training process.  While not explicitly named as "oversampling" or "undersampling," this method effectively gives more weight to the minority classes, mitigating the bias caused by their smaller representation in the data.
