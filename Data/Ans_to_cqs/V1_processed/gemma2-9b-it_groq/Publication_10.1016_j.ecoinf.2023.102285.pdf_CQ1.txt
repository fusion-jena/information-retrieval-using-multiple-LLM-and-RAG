The provided text focuses on detecting man-made objects in underwater and surface marine environments using deep learning.  While it mentions aerial surveys and underwater imagery as data sources, it doesn't explicitly list all methods used for collecting raw data in a general deep learning pipeline. 

Based on common practices in deep learning, here are some methods used for collecting raw data:

* **Surveys:**  As mentioned, aerial surveys are used for collecting images of surface marine environments. Similar surveys can be conducted on land or underwater using drones, planes, or boats equipped with cameras.
* **Sensors:** Various types of sensors can collect raw data, including:
    * **Cameras:**  Used for capturing images and videos.
    * **LiDAR:**  Measures distances to create 3D point clouds.
    * **Radar:**  Detects objects and their movement using radio waves.
    * **GPS:**  Provides location data.
    * **Accelerometers and Gyroscopes:**  Measure motion and orientation.
* **Public Datasets:** Many publicly available datasets contain labeled images, text, audio, and other types of data that can be used for training deep learning models.


It's important to note that the specific methods used for collecting raw data will vary depending on the application and the type of deep learning model being used.
