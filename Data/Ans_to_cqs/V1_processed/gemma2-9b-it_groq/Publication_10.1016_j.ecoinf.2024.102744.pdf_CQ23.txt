The provided text focuses on describing the methods and results of the pollen-bearing bee detection project, but it doesn't explicitly mention the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

The text does mention using a dataset called "VnPollenBee," but it doesn't provide details about the dataset's size, diversity, or how it was collected.  

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
