The provided text describes the process of training a model for land cover classification and mentions post-classification refinement. 

Specifically, it states: "Following map production, post-classification refinement was undertaken to improve the classification for certain classes and areas (e.g., swamp in southern Pembrokeshire). This required additional training data in areas known to be misclassified, with this obtained through aerial photograph interpretation and targeted field visits. Following reclassification of the VTs, the final nine-class VT map was generated."

The text does not detail other post-processing steps like saliency map generation, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction.
