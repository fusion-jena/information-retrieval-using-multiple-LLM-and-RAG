The provided text states that deep learning models are used to "fit the drivers and mechanisms of the LUCC, derive the probability maps needed for the SM, and perform further LU simulations." 

Based on this, we can infer that the purpose of the deep learning model is to **understand and predict land use change (LUCC)**. 

It does this by:

* **Identifying the factors that drive land use change:** This could include things like climate, population growth, economic development, and government policies.
* **Creating probability maps:** These maps show the likelihood of different land uses occurring in different areas.
* **Simulating future land use:** By combining the identified drivers and probability maps, the model can simulate how land use is likely to change over time.
