The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of a random forest model and a deep learning model for species richness estimation. It doesn't delve into the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization from this context.
