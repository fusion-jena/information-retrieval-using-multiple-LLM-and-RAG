The provided text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Average accuracy (%)**:  Represents the average accuracy for all classes at an IoU threshold of 0.5.
* **mAP50â€“95**:  Represents the average accuracy across all classes at different IoU thresholds, spanning from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05.
* **Precision (P)**:  Calculated as TP / (TP + FP), where TP is the number of true positives and FP is the number of false positives.
* **Recall (R)**: Calculated as TP / (TP + FN), where FN is the number of false negatives.
* **Time**:  Measured in milliseconds per image, it represents the total runtime for preprocessing, network inference, and post-processing stages.
