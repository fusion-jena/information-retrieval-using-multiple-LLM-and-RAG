The provided text focuses on evaluating the suitability of different models for transfer learning and analyzing embeddings. It mentions using the Brazil extract of the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset for this evaluation, but it doesn't explicitly describe the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model during its training. 

The text does not provide information about:

* **Dataset diversity:** Whether the training dataset encompassed a wide range of bird species, habitats, and recording conditions.
* **Cross-validation:**  Techniques used to split the data into training, validation, and test sets to assess model performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Methods for ensuring that the different classes of bird species are proportionally represented in each data split. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
