The provided text focuses on the application of CNN and LSTM models for drought prediction and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) or min-max scaling can be used to ensure features have similar scales.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical data into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is often necessary for deep learning models.

* **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets is crucial for evaluating model performance and preventing overfitting. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
