The provided text focuses on machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, GBDT, and XGBoost for water quality prediction, and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps specific to deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. This can involve techniques like standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max scaling.
* **Normalization:**  Scaling features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to improve model convergence.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations to existing data points (e.g., rotations, flips, crops for image data).


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning architecture.
