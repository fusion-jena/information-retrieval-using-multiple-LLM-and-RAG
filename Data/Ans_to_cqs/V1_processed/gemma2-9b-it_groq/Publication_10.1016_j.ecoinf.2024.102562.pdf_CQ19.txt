Cell morphology is not predictable from molecular data- sets, and combining morphological data from soil chips with classical molecular  biodiversity  datasets  will  enable  a  deeper  functional  inter- pretation of bacterial communities. We demonstrated the applicability of an interdisciplinary approach combining microfluidics and AI in mi- crobial  ecology  research  using  a  widely  used  model,  Mask  R-CNN. The  synergy  of  AI  and  microfluidics  allows  biologists  to  design  and  fabricate complex  micro-structures,  visualize  the  activities  of  migrated  active microbes, and analyze characteristics of individual or communities in an automated manner. The versatility of the algorithm to adapt to different microscopy  settings  including  a  portable  field  microscope  allows  to bacterial  abundance  and  morphology  for  work  carried  out  on  micro-fluidic platforms. Statistical data of distribution and morphology of live microbe in a soil-analogue environment gained from such methods is valuable  for  community  characterization  since  phenotypic  traits  of living organisms are as important as the commonly used cell biochem- ical  constituents.  Enormous  efforts  have  been  done  to  promote  deep learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise (Berg et al., 2019; G´omez-de Mariscal et al., 2021; In´es et al., 2019; Midtvedt et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2019; Sys et al., 2022; von Chamier et al., 2021). Our work showcases that the approach works under significantly different conditions, allows quantifying bacterial populations, and de-tects differences among bacterial communities from different locations.
