The provided text focuses on the challenges and techniques related to data scarcity and model interpretability in bioacoustics, particularly concerning deep learning. It doesn't delve into specific preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets proportionally reflect the distribution of target classes in the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards majority classes during training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances from minority classes to balance the class distribution. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can generate synthetic samples for minority classes.

* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from majority classes to balance the class distribution.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This is a crucial preventative measure.  Actively seeking out and incorporating data from diverse sources and representing various subgroups can help mitigate bias introduced during data collection.
