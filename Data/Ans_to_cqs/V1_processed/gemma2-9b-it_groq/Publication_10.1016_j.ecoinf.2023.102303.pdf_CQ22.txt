The provided text lists the following metrics for evaluating the performance of deep learning models:

* **Accuracy:**  The percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision:**  The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
* **AUC-ROC:**  The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
