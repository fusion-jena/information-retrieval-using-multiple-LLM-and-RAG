The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for bioacoustic classification and doesn't delve into specific data bias mitigation techniques used during preprocessing. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about techniques used to address data bias (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) based on the given context.
