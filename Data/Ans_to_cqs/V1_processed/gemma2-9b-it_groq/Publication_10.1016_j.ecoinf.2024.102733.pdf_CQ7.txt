The data is split using a stratified train-test split. This method is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets. 

In this case, the split is 80% for training and 20% for validation.  The key point is that the stratified split ensures that the proportion of each class is maintained in both the training and validation sets.  

This means that each class has approximately 80% of its samples in the training set and approximately 20% in the validation set. This helps ensure that all classes are represented proportionally during both the training and validation phases of the model.
