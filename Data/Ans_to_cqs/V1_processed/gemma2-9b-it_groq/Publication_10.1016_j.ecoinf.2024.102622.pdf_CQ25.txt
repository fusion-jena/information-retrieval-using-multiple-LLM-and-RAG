The provided text focuses on the extraction of crop-growing areas using remote sensing data and machine learning, particularly random forest classification.  

While it mentions a "lightweight rice disease identification network based on attention mechanism and dynamic convolution," it doesn't explicitly state the purpose of this deep learning model. 

Based on the name, it's likely that the deep learning model is designed for **disease detection** in rice crops.
