The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning models (ANFIS, ANN, and SVM). 

It does mention that the models were trained using a Best Training Subset (BTS) selected based on historical trends and variations in water quality data.  

However, it doesn't elaborate on the specific stopping criteria used during the training process itself. Common criteria for determining training completion include:

* **Validation loss plateau:** Training is stopped when the validation loss (loss on a separate validation dataset) stops decreasing significantly.
* **Maximum number of epochs:** Training is limited to a predefined number of iterations over the entire training dataset.
* **Early stopping:** Training is stopped if the validation loss starts increasing after a certain number of epochs, indicating potential overfitting.


To know the precise criteria used in this study, you would need to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly.
