The provided text focuses on the application of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) for soil nutrient concentration analysis. It doesn't offer information about data splitting criteria for deep learning models. 

Generally, for deep learning, the data is split into three sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and fine-tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** Used to assess the final performance of the trained model on unseen data, providing an unbiased estimate of its real-world capabilities.

The specific proportions for each set can vary, but a common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
