The provided text does not mention any deep learning pipelines or specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.  It focuses on a study using machine learning algorithms (specifically SVR and Random Forests) to predict aboveground biomass in the Himalayas. 

The datasets mentioned are:

* **Field data:** This likely refers to measurements of aboveground biomass collected in the field.
* **Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM):**  A digital elevation model with a resolution of 30 meters.
* **Vegetation-derived indices:**  These are calculated from satellite imagery and provide information about vegetation characteristics.
