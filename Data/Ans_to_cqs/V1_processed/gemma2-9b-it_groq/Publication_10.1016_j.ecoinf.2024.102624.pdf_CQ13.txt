The provided text does not mention any deep learning models. It focuses on three classification algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). 

The text details the hyperparameters used for tuning these algorithms:

* **RF:** `mtry` (number of input variables randomly sampled for each decision tree)
* **SVM:** `gamma` (influence of training data in the hyperspace defined by variables) and `C` (controls the trade-off between misclassifications and margin width)
* **MARS:** `degree` (maximum degree of interactions between input variables) and `nprune` (controls the complexity of the model)
