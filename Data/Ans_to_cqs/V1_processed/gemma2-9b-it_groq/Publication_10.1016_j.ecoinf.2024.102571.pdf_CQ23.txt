The provided text does not contain information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It only mentions the following:

* **Data Split:** 70% of the data was used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. 
* **Model Architecture:** A three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30â€“20-10 architecture was used.

The text does not discuss data diversity, cross-validation techniques, or stratified splitting.
