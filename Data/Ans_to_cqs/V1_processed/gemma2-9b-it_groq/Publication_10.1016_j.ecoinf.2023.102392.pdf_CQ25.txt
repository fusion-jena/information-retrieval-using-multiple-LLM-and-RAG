The provided text states that the study aims to enhance the use of deep learning models for **overlay categorization** utilizing images from UAVs and SPOT satellites. 

Based on this, the purpose of the deep learning model is likely **classification**. 

The text also mentions the need for reliable forest-type categorization to improve forest fire risk prediction models. This further supports the idea that the deep learning model is being used for classification, specifically to categorize different forest types.
