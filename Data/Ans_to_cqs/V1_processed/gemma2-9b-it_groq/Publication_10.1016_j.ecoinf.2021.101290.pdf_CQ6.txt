The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning in biological research and the use of IT infrastructure for data processing. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.

* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance.
