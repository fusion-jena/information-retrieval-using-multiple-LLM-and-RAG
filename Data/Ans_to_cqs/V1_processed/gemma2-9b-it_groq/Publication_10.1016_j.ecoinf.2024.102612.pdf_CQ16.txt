The provided text states that the training process continues for 1000 epochs.  After each epoch, metrics like MIoU (Mean Intersection over Union) or MA (Mean Accuracy) are calculated to analyze the training performance. 

The training is considered complete when the configuration weights that achieve the best classification performance are selected. This implies that the training process stops after 1000 epochs, and the best-performing model based on MIoU or MA is chosen.
