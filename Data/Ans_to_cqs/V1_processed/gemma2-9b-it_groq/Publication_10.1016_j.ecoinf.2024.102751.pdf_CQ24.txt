The provided text focuses on soil moisture estimation using remote sensing and doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning or strategies for handling randomness within its pipeline.  

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Deep learning models often use random initialization for weights and biases. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that the same "random" values are used each time you run the model, making the results reproducible.

* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This method normalizes the activations of each layer in a neural network, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing images or data points.

These strategies help mitigate the impact of randomness and promote more reliable and generalizable deep learning models.
