The provided text describes the preprocessing steps used for training an LSTM model for air quality prediction. 

The main preprocessing steps are:

1. **MinMaxScaler:** This technique scales each feature in the dataset to a range between 0 and 1. This helps to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process.

2. **Temporal Windowing:** The data is reshaped into a format suitable for the LSTM model. A temporal window of 12 previous observations (2 hours) is used, meaning each input to the model consists of 12 data points. 

The text doesn't explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps like:

* **Handling Missing Values:** Techniques like imputation or removal might be used to address missing data points.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones could be employed to improve model performance.
* **Data Cleaning:** Removing outliers or inconsistencies from the data is generally a good practice.



It's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps used can vary depending on the dataset and the chosen deep learning model.
