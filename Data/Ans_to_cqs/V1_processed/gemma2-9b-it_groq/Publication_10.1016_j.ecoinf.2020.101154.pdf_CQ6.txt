The provided text focuses on hyperparameter tuning and data splitting techniques for Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models, not on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context. 


Deep learning models often involve various preprocessing steps like:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but the goal is to reduce the range of feature values without a fixed target range.
* **Cleaning:** Handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and addressing outliers.
* **Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
