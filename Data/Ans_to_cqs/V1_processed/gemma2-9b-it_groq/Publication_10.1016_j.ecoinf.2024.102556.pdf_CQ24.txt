The provided text focuses on object tracking techniques and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the broader deep learning pipeline. 

While it mentions "random search," it's used in the context of motion compensation within a specific algorithm, not as a general randomness management technique in deep learning. 

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning (like random seed values), you'd need information about:

* **Random Number Generation:** How deep learning frameworks use random numbers for processes like weight initialization, dropout, and batch sampling.
* **Seed Setting:**  The practice of setting a specific random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
* **Techniques for Reducing Randomness:**  Methods like weight regularization and careful hyperparameter tuning that aim to minimize the impact of randomness on model performance.
