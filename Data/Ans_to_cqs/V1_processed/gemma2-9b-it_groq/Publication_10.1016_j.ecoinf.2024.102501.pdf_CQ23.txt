The provided text does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (LSTM).  

While the text mentions the use of three different data processing methods and compares their performance using metrics like R2, MSE, and MAE, it doesn't explicitly state whether techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset were employed to enhance the model's generalizability.
