While the provided text discusses various applications of remote sensing and machine learning in agriculture and ecology, it doesn't explicitly detail the specific data collection methods used in deep learning pipelines. 

However, based on the context, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Hyperspectral and Multispectral Sensors:**  Several papers mention the use of hyperspectral and multispectral sensors (e.g., AVIRIS-NG, Sentinel-2) for capturing data about vegetation, soil, and other environmental features. These sensors collect data across a wide range of wavelengths, providing detailed spectral information.
* **UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles):** The text mentions a study using a hyperspectral UAV image for detecting tree infestations. This suggests that UAVs equipped with sensors can be used to collect aerial imagery for deep learning applications.
* **Public Datasets:**  The phrase "public datasets" is not directly mentioned, but it's common practice in machine learning to utilize publicly available datasets for training and evaluating models. These datasets could contain various types of environmental data collected through different methods.


It's important to note that this is an educated guess based on the limited information provided. To get a definitive answer about the specific data collection methods used in a particular deep learning pipeline, you would need to consult the original research paper or documentation.
