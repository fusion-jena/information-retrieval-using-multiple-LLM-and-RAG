The provided text focuses on the impact of data split ratios and the use of a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize training data for wetland mapping.  

While it mentions that the 3D GAN model addresses the problem of imbalanced data, it doesn't delve into specific preprocessing techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
