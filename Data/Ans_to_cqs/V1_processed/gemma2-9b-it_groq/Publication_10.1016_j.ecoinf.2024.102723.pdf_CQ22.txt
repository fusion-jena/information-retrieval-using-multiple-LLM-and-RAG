The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning model:

* **MSE (Mean Squared Error):**  A common metric for regression tasks, measuring the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**  Another regression metric, calculating the average absolute difference between predictions and actual values.

* **SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error):**  A metric that expresses the average prediction error as a percentage of the actual value. It's considered more robust to outliers than MSE.

* **NMPIW (Normalized Mean Prediction Interval Width):**  A metric specifically designed to assess the quality of prediction intervals. It compares the width of the predicted intervals to the variability of the observed data. 


The text does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, which are typically used for classification tasks.
