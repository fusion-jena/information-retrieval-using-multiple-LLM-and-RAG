The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models, but it doesn't explicitly list metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. 

However, it does mention several performance metrics used in the study:

* **R2:** Measures goodness of fit.
* **NSE:**  (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency)  Assesses performance relative to benchmarks.
* **MEF:** (Mean Error Fraction)  Another metric for assessing performance relative to benchmarks.
* **Z-statistics:** Determine statistical significance.
* **RMSE:** (Root Mean Square Error)  Measures prediction accuracy.
* **MAE:** (Mean Absolute Error)  Another measure of prediction accuracy.
* **Taylor statistics:** Provide a holistic visualization of multiple metrics. 


While accuracy, precision, and recall are common metrics for evaluating deep learning models, this specific text focuses on different metrics relevant to the particular task and dataset being analyzed.
