The provided text mentions the use of random initialization of trainable parameters and different data folds for each of the three executions of the network training. 

Specifically, it states: "Each network, with a particular architecture and considering a specific substratum characterization, was trained and executed three times, each time with a different (random) initialization of the trainable parameters and with a different data fold."

This suggests that a random seed value is likely used to ensure reproducibility and to account for randomness introduced by the initialization of weights.  However, the text does not explicitly state the use of a specific random seed value.
