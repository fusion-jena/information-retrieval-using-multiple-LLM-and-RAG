The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It focuses on the data sources used (CMAP precipitation data and Landsat satellite datasets) and the preprocessing steps applied to the Landsat data (cloud cover filtering and radiometric calibration). 

Information about techniques like data splitting (e.g., stratified splitting), cross-validation, or the diversity of the training dataset is not included in the excerpt.
