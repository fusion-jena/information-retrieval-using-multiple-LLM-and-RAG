The provided text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, particularly in the context of object detection. These include:

* **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** This is the primary evaluation index for object detection, considering both precision and recall. It's calculated by averaging the precision at various recall values obtained from the precision-recall (PR) curve. 

* **Precision:**  A measure of how many of the predicted positive cases are actually correct.

* **Recall:** A measure of how many of the actual positive cases are correctly predicted.

* **Params (Parameters):**  The number of learned variables in the model. This reflects the model's complexity and computational demands.

* **FLOPs (Floating-Point Operations):**  Measures the number of floating-point arithmetic operations a model performs per second, indicating its computational intensity.

* **Inference Time:** The time taken by the model to process input data and generate predictions.

* **Training Time:** The time required for the model to learn from the training data.
