The provided text describes the development and performance of a hybrid model combining wavelet analysis and a NARX artificial neural network for predicting vegetation biomass density.  

While it details the data used for training and testing (2005-2015 for training, 2016-2018 for testing), it doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  The text doesn't elaborate on the diversity of the dataset in terms of geographical locations, vegetation types, or other relevant factors.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  The text doesn't mention whether the data was split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling to maintain the distribution of classes. 


Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
