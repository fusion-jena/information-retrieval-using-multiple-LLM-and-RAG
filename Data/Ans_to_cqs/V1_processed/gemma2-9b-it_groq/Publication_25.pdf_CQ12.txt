The text states that the model is a "self-supervised (red, green, blue (RGB) deep learning model".  While it doesn't specify the exact type of architecture (CNN, RNN, Transformer), it does mention that it's an RGB deep learning model, suggesting it likely uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture  suited for processing image data.
