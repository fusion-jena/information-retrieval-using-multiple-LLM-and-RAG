Based on the provided text snippets, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses **image** data formats. 

The text mentions:

*  "landscape photographs using a convolutional neural network" 
*  "automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs"
*  "image-based methods" for assessing and tracking landscape visual quality.


These references strongly suggest that images are the core input data for the deep learning models described in the context.
