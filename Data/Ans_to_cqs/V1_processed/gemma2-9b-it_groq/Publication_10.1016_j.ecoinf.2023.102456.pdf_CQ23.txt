The provided text focuses on the technical details of a deep learning model for forest fire simulation, particularly its architecture and the use of Gumbel-softmax for differentiability.  

It doesn't offer information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Dataset diversity:**  Whether the dataset used to train the model represents a variety of fire conditions, terrains, and weather patterns.
* **Cross-validation:**  Techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data by splitting it into training, validation, and test sets.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Methods for ensuring that the different classes (e.g., fire spread patterns) are proportionally represented in each data split. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
