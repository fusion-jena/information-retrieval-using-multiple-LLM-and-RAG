The provided text describes the use of several metrics to evaluate the performance of noise reduction methods, but it doesn't specify metrics used for evaluating the deep learning model itself (like accuracy, precision, or recall). 

The metrics mentioned for evaluating noise reduction are:

* **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SnNR):**  Calculated as the ratio between the power of the denoised signal and the noise.
* **Success Ratio (SR):**  Measures the change in variance between the original and denoised signal.
* **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):**  The ratio between the maximum signal power and the noise floor, determined by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original and denoised signal.
