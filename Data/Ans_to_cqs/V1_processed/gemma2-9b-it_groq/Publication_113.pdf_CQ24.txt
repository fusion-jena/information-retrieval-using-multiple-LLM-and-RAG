The provided text focuses on active learning techniques for image classification and doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.  

To address your query about handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Most deep learning libraries allow you to set a random seed. This ensures that the random numbers generated during processes like weight initialization and dropout are the same each time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Data Shuffling:**  Before training, data is often shuffled randomly. This prevents the model from learning patterns that might arise from the original order of the data.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique helps stabilize training by normalizing the activations within each layer. It can reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

* **Regularization Techniques:** Techniques like dropout and weight decay introduce controlled randomness during training. This can prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
