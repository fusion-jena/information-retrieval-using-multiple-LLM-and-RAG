The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for image analysis in a biological context (identifying animals in camera trap images).  

While it mentions the use of labeled data, it doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used to create those labels. 

Therefore, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques were used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) based on this text.
