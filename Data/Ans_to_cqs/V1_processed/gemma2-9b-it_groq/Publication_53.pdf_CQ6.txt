The text describes data augmentation techniques used to help generalize the model, such as:

* **Vertical flipping:**  Images are flipped vertically ( `flip_vert = TRUE`).
* **Lighting adjustment:**  Limits overly exposing the images (`max_lighting = 0.02`).
* **Zooming:** Zooming augmentation is disabled (`max_zoom = 1`).
* **Data type reduction:**  Reduces the memory load on the GPU (`to_fp16 = TRUE`). 

The text doesn't explicitly mention other preprocessing steps like normalization or scaling.
