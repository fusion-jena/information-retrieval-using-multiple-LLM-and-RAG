The provided text focuses on hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning algorithms (Random forest, Multivariate adaptive regression splines, etc.) but doesn't delve into the specifics of a deep learning model.  

Therefore, I cannot answer what hyperparameters are used in the deep learning model mentioned in the context.
