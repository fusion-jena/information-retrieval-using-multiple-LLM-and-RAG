The provided text describes the evaluation process and data splitting techniques used for the models, but it doesn't explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model during its training phase. 

The text highlights the following:

* **Data Splitting:** The data was split into training and evaluation datasets before model training. One fold was set aside for external evaluation, while the remaining four folds were used for internal cross-validation during model training.
* **Cross-Validation:** Internal cross-validation was employed during model training using four folds of the data.

However, it doesn't mention techniques like:

* **Diverse Dataset:**  Whether the dataset used to train the model was diverse in terms of the features it covered or the real-world scenarios it represented.
* **Stratified Splitting:** Whether the data was stratified during splitting to ensure that the distribution of classes or other important features was maintained in both the training and evaluation sets. 


Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model beyond the data splitting and cross-validation techniques described.
