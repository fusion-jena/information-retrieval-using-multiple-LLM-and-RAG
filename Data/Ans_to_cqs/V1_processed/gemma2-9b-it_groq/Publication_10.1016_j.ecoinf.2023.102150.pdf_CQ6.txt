The provided text describes the process of retraining a deep learning model for species identification using camera trap images.  It mentions that all images were resized to 224 x 224 pixels before training and that image augmentation techniques (shifts, horizontal flips, rotations, zooms, and shears) were applied. 

However, it doesn't explicitly state other preprocessing steps like normalization or scaling.
