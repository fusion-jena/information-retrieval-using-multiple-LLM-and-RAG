The text describes the use of cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.  

It states: "During the cross-validation process, there were no discrepancies among the three metrics used. Generally, the best model for each set of variables was optimal regarding the three metrics or the differences were <1%."

This suggests a k-fold cross-validation approach was used to train and evaluate the model on different subsets of the data, helping to assess its ability to generalize to unseen data. 

However, the text doesn't mention specific details about dataset diversity or stratified splitting techniques.
