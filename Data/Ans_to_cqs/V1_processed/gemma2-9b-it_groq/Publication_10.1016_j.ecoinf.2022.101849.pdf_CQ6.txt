The provided text focuses on the challenges of  predictive modeling of global vegetation cover with structurally incomplete target labels. It doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However,  generally,  common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of your data and the deep learning model you are using.
