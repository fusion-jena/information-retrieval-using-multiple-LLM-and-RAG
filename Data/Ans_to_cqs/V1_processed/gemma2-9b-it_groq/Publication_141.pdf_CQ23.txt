The text mentions that the dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for validation.  It also states that this 80:20 split was carried out "per category (chironomid taxa), where each fifth image was chosen for the validation dataset".  

This suggests a form of stratified splitting, ensuring that the validation set maintains the same distribution of taxa as the training set.  

The text does not mention other generalizability measures like cross-validation or the use of a diverse dataset.
