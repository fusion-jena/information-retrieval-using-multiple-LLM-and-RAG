The provided text states that the performance of the proposed WT-HMM model is compared using accuracy and F1-score metrics. 

Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model by calculating the ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances.

Precision focuses on the correctness of positive detections and classifications, helping to evaluate the model's ability to avoid false positives.

Recall measures the proportion of true positive detections and classifications among the actual positive instances in the dataset, focusing on the model's ability to detect positive instances and avoid false negatives.

The F1-score provides a balanced measure of the model's performance by considering both precision and recall.
