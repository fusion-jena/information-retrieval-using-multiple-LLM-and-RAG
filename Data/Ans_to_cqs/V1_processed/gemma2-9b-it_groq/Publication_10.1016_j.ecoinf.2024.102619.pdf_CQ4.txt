The provided text does not describe any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.  It does mention that images were resized to 224 pixels along the x-axis, preserving their aspect ratio, and then cropped to be square. It also states that RGB values were normalized. 

However, these are preprocessing steps, not data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation typically involves techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise to the images during training to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability.
