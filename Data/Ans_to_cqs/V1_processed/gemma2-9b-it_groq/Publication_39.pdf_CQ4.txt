The text describes the following data augmentation techniques:

* **Horizontal flip:**  Flipping the image or video frame horizontally.
* **Add/subtract intensity:** Adjusting the brightness of the image or video frame.
* **Gaussian blur:**  Slightly blurring the image or video frame.
* **Additive Gaussian noise:** Adding random noise to the image or video frame.
* **Fog:** Simulating fog in the video, a more complex technique. 

These techniques are applied to both images and videos in the deep learning pipeline.
