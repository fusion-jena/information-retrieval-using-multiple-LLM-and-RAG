The provided text focuses on the technical details of the UODN model architecture and doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure its generalizability.  

It describes modifications made to the original YOLOv8 network, such as using dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computational complexity.  

The text also outlines preprocessing steps like resizing images and applying mosaic data augmentation to the input data. However, it doesn't elaborate on the dataset's diversity, cross-validation techniques, or stratified splitting used for training and evaluating the model.
