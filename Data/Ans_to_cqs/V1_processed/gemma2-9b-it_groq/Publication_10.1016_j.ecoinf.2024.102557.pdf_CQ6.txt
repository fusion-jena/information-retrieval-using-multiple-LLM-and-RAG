The provided text focuses on the applications of deep learning in ecology and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training such models.  

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common preprocessing steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical data (e.g., species names) into numerical representations that the model can understand is often necessary.

* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating the model's performance. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
