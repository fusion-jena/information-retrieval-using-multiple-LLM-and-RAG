To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the following measures were taken:

* **Cross-validation:** Each model underwent 5-fold cross-validation. This technique involves splitting the dataset into five parts, training the model on four parts, and evaluating it on the remaining part. This process is repeated five times, using each part as the validation set once. This helps to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data and reduces the risk of overfitting.

* **Data Augmentation:** Data augmentation techniques were applied during training. This involves creating new training samples by applying transformations to existing ones, such as rotations, flips, and crops. This artificially increases the size and diversity of the dataset, exposing the model to a wider range of variations and improving its ability to generalize to unseen data.
