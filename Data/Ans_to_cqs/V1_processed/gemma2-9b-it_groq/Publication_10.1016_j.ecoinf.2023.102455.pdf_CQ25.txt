The provided text describes a deep learning model used for **multi-temporal forecasting of daily streamflow (Qflow)**.  

It mentions four complementary models: MVMD-CNN-BiGRU, MVMD-RVFL, MVMD-KELM, and MVMD-CNN-BiRNN. These models are trained and tested to predict future streamflow values based on historical data.
