The provided text does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.  It mentions training a Siamese network using few-shot learning with a two-way one-shot learning setup. 

However, it doesn't delve into the specific values for hyperparameters like:

* Learning rate
* Optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD)
* Number of layers
* Batch size
* Loss function 


To find these details, you would need to consult the full research paper or code repository associated with this work.
