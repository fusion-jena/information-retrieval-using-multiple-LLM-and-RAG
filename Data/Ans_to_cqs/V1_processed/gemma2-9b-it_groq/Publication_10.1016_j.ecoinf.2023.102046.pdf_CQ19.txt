The provided text states that the HuggingFace implementations of ViT and ResNet were used, and the Keras implementation of Inception-V3. 

While these are not the underlying deep learning frameworks themselves (like TensorFlow or PyTorch), they are libraries built upon those frameworks. 

Therefore, we can infer that TensorFlow or a framework compatible with HuggingFace's Transformers library was used for ViT and ResNet, and Keras, which is built on top of TensorFlow, was used for Inception-V3.
