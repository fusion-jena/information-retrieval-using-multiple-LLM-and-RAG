The provided text focuses on comparing different deep learning models (ResNet-50, Inception-V3, ViT) for a specific task and doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) helps improve model training stability and convergence.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Techniques like rotation, flipping, cropping, and color adjustments are applied to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, making the model more robust.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Converting categorical variables (e.g., class labels) into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for deep learning models to understand them.
