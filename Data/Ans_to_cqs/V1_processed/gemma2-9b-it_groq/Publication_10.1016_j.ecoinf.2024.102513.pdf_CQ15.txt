The provided text focuses on the structure and function of convolutional neural networks, particularly in the context of land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It doesn't delve into the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. 

Common optimization algorithms used in deep learning include:

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  A fundamental optimization algorithm that iteratively updates model weights by moving in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.

* **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation):** An adaptive learning rate method that combines aspects of momentum and RMSprop, often demonstrating faster convergence than SGD.

* **RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation):** Another adaptive learning rate method that addresses the issue of vanishing gradients by using a moving average of squared gradients.

There are many other optimization techniques, but these are some of the most widely used.
