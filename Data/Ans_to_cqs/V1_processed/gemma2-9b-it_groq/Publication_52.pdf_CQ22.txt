The text provides several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. These include:

* **Classification Accuracy (ACC):**  Measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**  A measure of the average magnitude of the errors in predictions.
* **Precision:**  The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
* **Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total actual positive observations.
* **F-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
* **ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic):** A graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of the classifier system by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings.
