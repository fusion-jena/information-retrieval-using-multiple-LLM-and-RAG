The provided text focuses on the application of CNNs in remote sensing and doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.  

While it mentions Batch Normalization (BN) as a technique to address vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs, it doesn't explicitly list dropout or L2 regularization.
