The provided text focuses on geostatistical methods and map evaluation, and doesn't offer information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance. Common techniques include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, this adjusts the scale of features to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding) is necessary as deep learning models typically work with numerical data.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) can enhance model robustness and generalization.
