Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are:

* **Image:** The text mentions "simple colour image" and "RGB channels" indicating the use of image data. 
* **CSV:** While not explicitly stated, the mention of "SPAD value gained by the SPAD-502Plus handheld sensor" and subsequent correlation analysis suggests the use of CSV or a similar tabular format to store sensor readings and potentially other related data. 


It's important to note that the context focuses on a specific application of deep learning in agriculture and might not represent the full range of data formats used in all deep learning pipelines.
