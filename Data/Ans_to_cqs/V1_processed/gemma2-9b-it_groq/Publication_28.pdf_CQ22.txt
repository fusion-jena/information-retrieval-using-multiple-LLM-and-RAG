The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of deep learning models:

* **Precision:**  A measure of how many of the predicted positive cases are actually positive.
* **Recall:** A measure of how many of the actual positive cases are correctly predicted.
* **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of performance.
* **F2-Score:**  Similar to the F1-score but gives more weight to recall.
