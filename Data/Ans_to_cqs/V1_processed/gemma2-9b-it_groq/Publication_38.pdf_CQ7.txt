The provided text focuses on acoustic testing datasets and deep learning applications in areas like environmental sound classification and bat acoustic signal detection. It doesn't specify the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation in deep learning models. 


To answer your question generally:

Data splitting for deep learning is crucial to evaluate model performance accurately.  A common approach is:

* **Training set:**  The largest portion (e.g., 70-80%) used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data.
* **Validation set:** A smaller portion (e.g., 10-15%) used during training to monitor performance on unseen data. This helps prevent overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).
* **Test set:**  A separate, held-out portion (e.g., 10-15%) used *only once* at the end of training to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's final performance. 

The specific split ratios can vary depending on the dataset size and the problem being addressed.
