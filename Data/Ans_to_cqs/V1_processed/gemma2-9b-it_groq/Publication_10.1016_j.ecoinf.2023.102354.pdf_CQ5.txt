The provided text focuses on groundwater-climate interactions and mentions various datasets related to this topic. However, it doesn't specify any deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. 

The text lists datasets such as:

* TWS (Terrestrial Water Storage)
* SMS (Soil Moisture Storage)
* GWS (Groundwater Storage)
* SPEI (Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index)
* ENSO (El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation)
* NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation)
* AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation)
* PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation)
* IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole)
* and others related to ocean and atmospheric conditions. 


These datasets are likely used for hydrological modeling and understanding climate change impacts on groundwater resources, not for deep learning image recognition tasks.
