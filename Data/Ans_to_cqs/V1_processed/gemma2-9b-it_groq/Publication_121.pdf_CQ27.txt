The trained deep learning models were converted into the TensorFlow Lite format using the TensorFlow Lite converter. This conversion process allows the models to be deployed on mobile and IoT devices.  The TensorFlow Lite version of the models was then integrated into an Android application developed using Android Studio and the Java programming language.
