The provided text describes the data augmentation techniques used during training, which include:

* **Rotation:** Rotating the input images by a certain angle.
* **Reflection bias:** Adjusting the reflectance of the image by ±10%.
* **Random noise:** Adding random noise to the image with a reflectance variation of ±10% for 15% of the image. 

It doesn't mention any preprocessing steps like normalization or scaling applied before training.
