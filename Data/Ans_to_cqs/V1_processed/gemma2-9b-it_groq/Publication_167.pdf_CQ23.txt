The text describes the use of 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model.  It states: "The training and validation set ia divided into ten parts using the 10-fold cross-validation method, in which nine of the parts are used as a training set and one is used for the validation set."  

This technique helps ensure the model's generalizability by training and evaluating it on different subsets of the data. 

The text also mentions that the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 5.4:0.6:1. This split further contributes to evaluating the model's ability to perform on unseen data (the testing set). 


However, the text doesn't explicitly mention other techniques like using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting.
