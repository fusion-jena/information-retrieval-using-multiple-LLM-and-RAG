The provided text focuses on using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for species distribution modeling. It mentions using "ecological and bioclimatic satellite-based observations" to establish the probability distribution of  *Rhododendron arboreum*. 

While it doesn't explicitly state the data formats, it's highly likely that the "satellite-based observations" would be in the form of **raster data**, which is a common format for geospatial information like satellite imagery. 

CNNs are particularly well-suited for processing grid-like data like raster images.
