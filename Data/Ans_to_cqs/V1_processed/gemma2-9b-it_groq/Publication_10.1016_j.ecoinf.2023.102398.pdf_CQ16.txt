The provided text describes the training process and results but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

It mentions "graded MSE convergence" (Figs. 7 to 11) and avoiding over-training, suggesting that monitoring the model's performance (likely measured by Mean Squared Error) and observing for signs of overfitting might be part of the stopping criteria. 

However, without further information from the text or the figures, it's impossible to definitively say what specific criteria were used to conclude training.
