The provided text describes the model training process but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor performance during training. 

It does mention:

* **Splitting the dataset:** The dataset was divided into a "training dataset" (60 records) and a "testing dataset" (29 records).

* **Model fitting and validation:**  Models were fitted using the "training dataset" and then validated using the "testing dataset".

This suggests a common practice in machine learning: training the model on one part of the data and evaluating its performance on a separate, unseen part. 

However, the text lacks details about specific metrics used to monitor performance during training (e.g., loss function, accuracy on the training set).
