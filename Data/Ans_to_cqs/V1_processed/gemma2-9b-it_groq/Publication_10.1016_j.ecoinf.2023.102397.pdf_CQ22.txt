The text provides information about the evaluation metrics used for a specific deep learning model, which is a bird vocalization recognizer.  

The metrics used are:

* **Precision:**  The proportion of recognized hits that are actually true detections of the target species. 
* **Recall:** The proportion of target species vocalizations that are correctly identified as hits by the recognizer.
* **F-score:** A combined measure of precision and recall, where Î² = 1 indicates equal weighting of both metrics. 


The text explains how these metrics are calculated and used to assess the overall performance of the bird vocalization recognizer.
