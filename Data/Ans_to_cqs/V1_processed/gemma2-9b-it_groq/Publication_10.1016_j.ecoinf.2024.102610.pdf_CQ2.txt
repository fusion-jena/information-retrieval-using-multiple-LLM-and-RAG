Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. 

However, some clues can be inferred:

* **Gonz´alez Jim´enez et al. (2019)** mention using "mid-infrared spectroscopy" which suggests the use of spectral data.
* **Kaur et al. (2021 & 2022)** focus on "machine and deep learning techniques for predictive modeling of vector-borne diseases," implying potential use of geospatial data, climate data, and possibly disease incidence records (potentially in CSV format).

Without further information from the cited papers, it's impossible to definitively list all data formats used.
