The provided text describes the model training process and parameters but doesn't explicitly state a strategy for monitoring performance during training.  It mentions using  "10 times 10-fold CV" (cross-validation) to evaluate the models' accuracy and loss, but this is done after training, not during. 


It does say that "lower cross-entropy is, mutual closer are" and that regularization loss is used to "reduce overfitting, which balances model performance and model complexity." These are techniques that indirectly influence performance, but they aren't described as real-time monitoring methods.
