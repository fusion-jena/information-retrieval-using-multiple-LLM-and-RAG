The text states that the following metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models:

* **Accuracy:**  Measures the overall correctness of the model.
* **Sensitivity (Recall):**  Measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases.
* **Specificity:** Measures the model's ability to correctly identify negative cases.
* **Precision:** Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all cases predicted as positive.
* **F1-Score:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.
