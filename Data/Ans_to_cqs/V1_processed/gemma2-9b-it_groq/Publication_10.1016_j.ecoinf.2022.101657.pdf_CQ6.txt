The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in camera trap data analysis and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training such models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves removing irrelevant information, such as noise, duplicates, or corrupted data points.

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, or cropping can enhance model robustness.

* **Labeling:**  Accurately labeling the data with the corresponding species or categories is crucial for supervised learning.

* **Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets is essential for evaluating model performance. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the dataset and the chosen deep learning model.
