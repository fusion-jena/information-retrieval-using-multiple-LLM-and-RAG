The strategy used to monitor model performance during training is the use of a validation set. 

This validation set is separate from the training data and is not used to adjust the model's parameters.  

The model's performance on the validation set is tracked over the course of training.  

In this study, the validation loss stabilized after 30 epochs, indicating that further training might lead to overfitting. This suggests that the model had learned to perform well on the training data but was starting to memorize it instead of generalizing.
