The provided text describes the process of deploying the trained model to an edge device, specifically a Raspberry Pi (RPi). 

The process involves the following steps:

1. **Conversion to TensorFlow Lite format:** The trained TensorFlow or TensorFlow Lite model is converted to the TensorFlow Lite format. This reduces the model's size, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices like the RPi.

2. **Optional Optimization:** The model can be further optimized for size or latency depending on the specific application requirements and the capabilities of the edge device.

3. **Deployment on RPi:** The optimized TensorFlow Lite model is then deployed on the RPi for classifying unseen images. 


The text also mentions the possibility of using the RPi to run XAI techniques like Grad-CAM for generating visualizations through heatmaps.
