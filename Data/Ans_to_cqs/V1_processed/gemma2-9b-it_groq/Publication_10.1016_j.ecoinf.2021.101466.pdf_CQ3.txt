The provided text focuses on the training process and dataset augmentation techniques used for the EfficientNet model.  It doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used to prepare the dataset. 

However, it does mention:

* **Bounding boxes:** The text refers to "ground-truth bounding box" and "predicted bounding box" when discussing the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric for evaluating object detection accuracy. This suggests that bounding box annotation was likely used to label objects in the images. 


Therefore, we can infer that **bounding box annotation** was probably used in the deep learning pipeline.
