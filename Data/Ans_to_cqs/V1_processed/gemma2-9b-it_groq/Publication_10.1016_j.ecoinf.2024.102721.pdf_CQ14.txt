The provided text states that the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using **Bayesian optimization (BO)**. 

It explains that BO is a global optimization algorithm that leverages the Bayesian theorem to estimate the posterior distribution of target functions.  

The algorithm builds a surrogate function based on past evaluations of the target function and iteratively searches for the next set of hyperparameters that minimize this surrogate function.
