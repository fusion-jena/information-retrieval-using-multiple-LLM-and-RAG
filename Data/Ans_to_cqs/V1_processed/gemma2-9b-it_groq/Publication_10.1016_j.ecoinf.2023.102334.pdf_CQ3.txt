The provided text focuses on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and its application in computer vision. It doesn't delve into specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on general knowledge of computer vision tasks, here are some common data annotation techniques:

* **Bounding Box Annotation:**  Drawing a rectangular box around an object of interest in an image. This is used for object detection tasks.
* **Instance Segmentation:**  Similar to bounding boxes, but each pixel belonging to an object is individually labeled. This allows for identifying and segmenting multiple instances of the same object in an image.
* **Semantic Segmentation:**  Assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, creating a pixel-wise classification map. This is used for tasks like scene understanding and image classification.
* **Keypoint Annotation:**  Marking specific points of interest on an object, such as the corners of a face or the joints of a human body. This is used for tasks like pose estimation and action recognition.
* **Polygon Annotation:**  Drawing a polygon around an object to define its precise shape. This is useful for objects with irregular boundaries.

These are just a few examples, and the specific techniques used depend on the particular deep learning task and the dataset.
