The text states that the researchers used cross-validation to test the model performance. 

They split the dataset into 70% for training and 30% for testing.  The Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristic Curve (AUC) was used as the index to specify the accuracy of the models. AUC ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with a higher value indicating better model accuracy.
