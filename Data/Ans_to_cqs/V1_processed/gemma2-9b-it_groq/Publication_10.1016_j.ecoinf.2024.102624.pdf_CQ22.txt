The provided text describes the evaluation of machine learning models (RF, SVM, MARS) rather than deep learning models.  

The text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of these models:

* **Overall Accuracy (OA):**  The percentage of correctly classified samples.
* **User's Accuracy (UA):**  The proportion of samples of a particular class that are correctly classified.
* **Producer's Accuracy (PA):** The proportion of actual occurrences of a particular class that are correctly classified. 


The text does not discuss metrics commonly used for deep learning models like precision, recall, or F1-score.
