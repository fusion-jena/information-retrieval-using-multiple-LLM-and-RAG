Deep learning models can process a variety of data formats. Some common ones include:

* **Image:**  Images are often represented as multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) where each element corresponds to a pixel's intensity or color value.

* **Audio:** Audio data is typically represented as a sequence of numerical values representing sound wave amplitudes over time.

* **Video:** Video is essentially a sequence of images, so it can be processed frame by frame using image processing techniques.

* **Text:** Text data is often represented as sequences of words or characters, which can be processed using techniques like word embeddings.

* **CSV:** CSV (Comma Separated Values) files store tabular data, which can be easily converted into numerical arrays for deep learning models.

* **Time Series:**  Data points collected over time, such as stock prices or sensor readings, can be processed as sequences.


These are just a few examples, and the specific format used will depend on the nature of the data and the task at hand.
