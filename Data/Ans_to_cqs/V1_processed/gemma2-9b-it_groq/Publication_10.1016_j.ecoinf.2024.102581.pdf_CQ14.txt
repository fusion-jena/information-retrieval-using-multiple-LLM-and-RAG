The provided text describes a method for optimizing CNN hyperparameters using a population-based evolutionary algorithm.  

It states that the algorithm starts with multiple populations of candidate hyperparameter sets. These populations evolve over iterations, with better-performing hyperparameter sets (those achieving higher accuracy) being favored and passed on to subsequent generations. 

The text doesn't explicitly mention techniques like grid search or random search, which are common hyperparameter optimization methods. Instead, it focuses on the evolutionary process of selecting and modifying hyperparameters based on their performance.
