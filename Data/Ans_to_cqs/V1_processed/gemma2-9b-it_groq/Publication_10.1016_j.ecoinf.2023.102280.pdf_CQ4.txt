The provided text mentions one data augmentation technique specifically for bioacoustics applications: 

* **Superimposing noise samples:** This technique involves adding noise samples to the existing audio data to create a noisier version. This can be helpful for training models in environments where noise is prevalent. 

The text does not discuss other common data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are typically used with image data.
