The provided text mentions two specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model:

* **mAP50:**  This stands for mean Average Precision at a 50% Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold. It's a metric commonly used for object detection tasks. A higher mAP50 value indicates that the model is better at correctly predicting the location and class of objects in images.

* **Classification loss (cls loss):** This metric measures the error in the predicted class probabilities for each object in an image compared to the ground truth. A lower classification loss suggests the model is more accurate in classifying the objects. 


The text also alludes to the use of  "YOLO training losses," which likely refers to the overall loss function used during the training process of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model.
