The provided text focuses on a bioacoustics challenge and mentions specific systems and methods used, but it doesn't list the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. 

It does mention two datasets by name:

* **QU:** Described as containing very short sounds.
* **MGE:** Also described as containing very short sounds.

The text also refers to:

* **Du_NERCSLIP(23):** A system that excelled on the QU dataset, suggesting it was likely trained on it.

However, it doesn't explicitly state if these are the only datasets used or if others are involved.
