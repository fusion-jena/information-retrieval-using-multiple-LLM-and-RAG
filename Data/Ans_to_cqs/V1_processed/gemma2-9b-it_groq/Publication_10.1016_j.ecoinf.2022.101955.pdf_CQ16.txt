The provided text focuses on the accuracy assessment of kNN and RF classification models for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping. It doesn't delve into the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training for these models. 

Generally, in machine learning, training is considered complete when a model achieves satisfactory performance on a validation set.  Common criteria for this include:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:**  If the loss function (a measure of the model's error) on the validation set stops decreasing or decreases very slowly, it might indicate that the model is overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data).

* **Validation Accuracy Peak:**  Similarly, if the accuracy on the validation set reaches a peak and then starts to decline, it's a sign of overfitting.

* **Predefined Number of Epochs:**  Training is sometimes stopped after a fixed number of epochs (passes through the entire training dataset).

* **Early Stopping:**  This technique monitors the validation performance and stops training if it doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs.


To know the precise criteria used in this specific study, you would need to refer to the original research paper or the code used for training the models.
