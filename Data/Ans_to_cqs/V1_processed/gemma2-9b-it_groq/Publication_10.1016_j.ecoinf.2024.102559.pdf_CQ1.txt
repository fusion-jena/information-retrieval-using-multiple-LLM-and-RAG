The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning to analyze remotely sensed data for environmental monitoring, particularly invasive species detection.  

While it mentions using "remotely sensed images" and "high resolution data," it doesn't specify the exact sensors or technologies used to collect this raw data. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively list the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
