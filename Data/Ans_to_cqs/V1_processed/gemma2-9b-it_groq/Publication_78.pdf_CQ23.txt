The provided text focuses on the development and performance evaluation of a deep learning model for classifying bleached and unbleached corals.  

While it describes the model architecture (CoralNet), training parameters, and performance metrics, it doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot say for sure what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
