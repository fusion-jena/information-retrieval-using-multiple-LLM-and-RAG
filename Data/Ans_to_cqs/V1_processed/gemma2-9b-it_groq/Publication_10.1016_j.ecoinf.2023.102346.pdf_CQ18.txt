The text describes the evaluation of model performance after training, not the monitoring strategy during training. 

The authors used several metrics to assess the performance of the trained models:

* **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**
* **True Skill Statistics (TSS)**
* **Cohenâ€™s KAPPA**
* **Point-biserial correlation (COR)**
* **Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC)**

They also employed techniques like 10-fold cross-validation and 10-fold bootstrapping to ensure unbiased and robust accuracy estimates. 

The text does not specify how model performance was monitored *during* the training process.
