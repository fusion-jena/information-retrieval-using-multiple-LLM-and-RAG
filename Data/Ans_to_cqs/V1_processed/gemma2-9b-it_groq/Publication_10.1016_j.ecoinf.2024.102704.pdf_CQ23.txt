The provided text describes the process of training deep learning models (LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) across four scales (n, s, m, and l) using a targeted fish species dataset. 

However, it doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.  

The text mentions that the dataset was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using random selection. This suggests some form of data splitting, but it doesn't explicitly state whether techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed. 


Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
