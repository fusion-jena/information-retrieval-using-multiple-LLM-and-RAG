The provided text focuses on object-oriented classification using nearest neighbor and random forest algorithms, not deep learning. Therefore, it doesn't mention specific metrics used to evaluate deep learning models. 

However, common metrics for evaluating deep learning models include:

* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision:** The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall:** The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **AUC (Area Under the Curve):**  A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes.


Let me know if you have any other questions about the provided text or object-oriented classification.
