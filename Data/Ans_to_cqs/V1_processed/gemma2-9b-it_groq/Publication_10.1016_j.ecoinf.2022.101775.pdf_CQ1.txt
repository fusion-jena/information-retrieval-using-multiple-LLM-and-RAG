The provided text focuses on deep learning applications in specific domains like environmental monitoring, sentiment analysis, and e-commerce. It doesn't delve into the general methods of data collection used in deep learning pipelines. 

However, based on common practices in the field, here are some methods used for collecting raw data:

* **Sensors:**  As seen in the paper by Shah et al. (2020) on PM2.5 prediction, sensors are widely used to collect environmental data. 
* **Surveys:**  Surveys can be used to gather textual data for tasks like sentiment analysis (Sharma et al., 2020).
* **Public Datasets:**  Many publicly available datasets exist, covering a wide range of domains, which can be used for training and evaluating deep learning models.

Other methods include:

* **Web Scraping:** Extracting data from websites.
* **Social Media APIs:** Accessing data from platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
* **Image and Video Capture:** Using cameras and video recorders to collect visual data.
* **Audio Recordings:** Capturing sound for speech recognition and other audio-related tasks.
