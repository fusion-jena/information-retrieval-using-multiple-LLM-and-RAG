The provided text does not describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It focuses on the data splitting, model selection, and performance evaluation of four machine learning models (AdaBoost, Random Forest, Multilayer Neural Network, and Bayesian Ridge Regression) for forest AGB estimation.
