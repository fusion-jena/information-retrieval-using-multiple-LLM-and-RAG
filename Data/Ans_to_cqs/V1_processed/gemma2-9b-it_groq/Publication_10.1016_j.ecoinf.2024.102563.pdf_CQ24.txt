Several strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

* **Random Seed Initialization:**  Deep learning models often initialize weights randomly. Setting a fixed random seed ensures that the same random weights are used each time a model is trained, making the results reproducible. This is crucial for comparing different model architectures or hyperparameters.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features that are not reliant on any single neuron.

* **Data Augmentation:** Randomly applying transformations to training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) increases the diversity of the training set and helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and stabilizing training. It introduces randomness in a controlled way during each batch update.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This optimization algorithm uses a random subset (batch) of the training data to calculate the gradient at each step. This introduces noise into the optimization process, which can help escape local minima and find better solutions.

By carefully considering and controlling these sources of randomness, researchers and practitioners can build more reliable and reproducible deep learning models.
