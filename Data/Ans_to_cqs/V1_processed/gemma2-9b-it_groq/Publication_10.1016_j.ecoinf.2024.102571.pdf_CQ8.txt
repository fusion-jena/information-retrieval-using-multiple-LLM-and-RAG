I do not have access to information about code repositories or specific file locations. The provided context consists of research papers and reports, which do not typically include details about code availability. 

To find the code repository for a deep learning pipeline, you would need to:

* **Check the research paper's acknowledgments or supplementary materials:** Authors often mention code availability and links in these sections.
* **Look for a website or project page associated with the research:** Many research projects have dedicated websites that provide access to code, data, and other resources.
* **Search online code repositories:** Use keywords related to the research topic and the authors' names to search platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
