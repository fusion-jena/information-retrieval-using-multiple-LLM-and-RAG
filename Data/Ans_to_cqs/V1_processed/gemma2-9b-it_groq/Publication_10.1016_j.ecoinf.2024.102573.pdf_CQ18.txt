The strategy used to monitor model performance during training was to use the first five seconds of each validation recording.  

This approach was chosen because the labeled species are typically present within the initial few seconds of recordings from Xeno-Canto.  Preliminary experiments confirmed that this method significantly reduced computation time while still yielding valid results compared to evaluating on the full length of the recordings.
