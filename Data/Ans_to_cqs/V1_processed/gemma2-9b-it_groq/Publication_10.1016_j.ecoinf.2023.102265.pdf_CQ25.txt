The provided text describes a deep learning model used for **image classification**. 

Specifically, it extracts features from insect images using a ResNet-50 model and then uses these features to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM classifier is used to categorize the backgrounds of the insect images into two classes.
