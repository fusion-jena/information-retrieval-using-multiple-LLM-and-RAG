The provided text focuses on the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and doesn't delve into the specifics of addressing data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as they relate to deep learning preprocessing based on this context.
