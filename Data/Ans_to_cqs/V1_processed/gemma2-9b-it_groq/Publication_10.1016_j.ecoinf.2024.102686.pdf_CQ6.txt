The provided text focuses on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and  Human Activity (HA)â€“Natural Endowment (NE) coupled zoning, and doesn't offer information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to have a similar scale, often using techniques like standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max scaling. This helps algorithms converge faster and prevents features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a specific range, usually between 0 and 1. This is beneficial for activation functions in neural networks that are sensitive to input ranges.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) into numerical representations that models can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance. This can involve combining features, extracting relevant information, or transforming data into a more suitable format.
