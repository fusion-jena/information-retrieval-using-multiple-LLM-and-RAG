The provided text focuses on the challenges and considerations related to data processing and training sample selection for classification models. It doesn't delve into the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of input data that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are used to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about post-processing steps.
