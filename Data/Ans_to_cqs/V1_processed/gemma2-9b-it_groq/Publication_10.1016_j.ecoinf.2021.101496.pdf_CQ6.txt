The provided text focuses on SPAD value modeling using various techniques like linear regression and artificial neural networks. It doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, generally, preprocessing steps for deep learning models often include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but it aims to standardize the distribution of features, often by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data (e.g., text labels) into numerical representations that the model can understand. Common techniques include one-hot encoding or label encoding.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance. This can involve combining features, extracting patterns, or transforming data. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
