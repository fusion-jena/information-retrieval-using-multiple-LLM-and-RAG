The deep learning model in this study is used for **regression**. 

Specifically, three separate multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are trained to predict:

1. The start of the vegetation season
2. The peak of the vegetation season
3. The height of the peak vegetation season 


These models learn complex patterns in the data to make predictions about vegetation phenology characteristics.
