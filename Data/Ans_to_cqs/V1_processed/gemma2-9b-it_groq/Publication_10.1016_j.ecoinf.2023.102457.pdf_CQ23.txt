The provided text does not describe any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 


It does mention that the researchers used a pre-trained CNN model (BirdNET) which was originally trained on bird vocalizations. They also suggest that training a model with data specific to gibbon vocalizations could lead to better performance, implying that the pre-trained model's performance might be limited by the domain mismatch.
