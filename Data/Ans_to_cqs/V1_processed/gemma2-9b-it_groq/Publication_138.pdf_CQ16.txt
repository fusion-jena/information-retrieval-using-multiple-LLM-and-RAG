The provided text focuses on the architecture and performance of a convolutional neural network, comparing it to other established models like LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-19, and ResNet.  

It doesn't, however, discuss the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. 

Common criteria for training completion include:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:**  When the loss on a validation set (separate from the training data) stops decreasing significantly, it suggests the model is likely overfitting and further training might not be beneficial.
* **Epoch Limit:**  Setting a maximum number of training epochs (passes through the entire dataset) can act as a stopping point.
* **Performance Metric Threshold:**  Training can stop when a desired performance metric (e.g., accuracy on the validation set) is reached.
