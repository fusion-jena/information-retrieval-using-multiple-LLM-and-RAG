The provided text focuses on the model development process, particularly the use of wavelet transform and grey wolf optimizer for enhancing the performance of a support vector regression (SVR) model in predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. 

It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency map generation, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix construction. These are common techniques used in machine learning after model training for:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which input features are most influential in the model's predictions.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. (relevant for classification tasks).
* **Confusion matrix:**  Displaying the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.


Since the text primarily discusses the model building aspect, it doesn't offer information about these post-processing steps.
