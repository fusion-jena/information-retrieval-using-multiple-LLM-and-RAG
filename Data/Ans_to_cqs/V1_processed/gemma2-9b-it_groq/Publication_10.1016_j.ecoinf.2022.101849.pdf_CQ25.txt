The provided text focuses on the challenges of  predicting potential natural vegetation (PNV) using machine learning, particularly when dealing with incomplete or noisy label data.  

While it mentions various machine learning methods like neural networks, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors, it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of these models beyond PNV mapping. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively say what the purpose of the deep learning model is.
