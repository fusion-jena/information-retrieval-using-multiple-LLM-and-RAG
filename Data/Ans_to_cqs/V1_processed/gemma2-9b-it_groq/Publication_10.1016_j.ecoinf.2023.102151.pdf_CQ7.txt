To answer your query, here's a general explanation of data splitting in deep learning:

Deep learning models are trained on large datasets. To ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data and avoid overfitting (memorizing the training data), the data is typically split into three sets:

* **Training set:** The largest portion of the data (e.g., 70-80%) used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** A smaller portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps monitor the model's progress and prevent overfitting.
* **Test set:**  A separate, unseen portion of the data (e.g., 10-15%) used only once at the end of training to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on completely new data.

The choice of splitting ratios can vary depending on the dataset size and specific problem.
