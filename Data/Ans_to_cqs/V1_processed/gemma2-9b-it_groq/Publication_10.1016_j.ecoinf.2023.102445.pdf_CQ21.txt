The provided text focuses on the model architecture, training parameters, and ablation experiments. It doesn't describe the specific post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of the input image that are most influential in the model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mAP (mean Average Precision).
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your question about the post-processing steps.
