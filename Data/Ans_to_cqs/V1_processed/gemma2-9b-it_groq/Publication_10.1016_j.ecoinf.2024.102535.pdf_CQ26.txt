The provided text focuses on the experimental setup and architecture of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification.  It mentions class imbalance as a potential issue but doesn't detail the specific techniques used to address it during the preprocessing stage. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
