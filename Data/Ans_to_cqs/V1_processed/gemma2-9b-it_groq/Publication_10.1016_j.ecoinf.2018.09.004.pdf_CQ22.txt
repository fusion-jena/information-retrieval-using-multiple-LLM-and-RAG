The provided text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, including:

* **Accuracy:**  The ratio of correctly classified instances (both true positives and true negatives) to the total number of instances.

* **Precision:** The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions (true positives plus false positives).

* **Recall:** The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances (true positives plus false negatives).

* **F-measure:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure that considers both false positives and false negatives. 


The text states that while accuracy is a suitable measure, the F-measure is often preferred for ranking algorithms because it provides a more comprehensive evaluation.
