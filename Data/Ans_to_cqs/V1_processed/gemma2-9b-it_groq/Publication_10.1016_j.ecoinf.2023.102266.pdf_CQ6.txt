The provided text focuses on improving a cellular automaton model and doesn't discuss preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

Common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to have a similar scale, often using techniques like standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max scaling.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that models can understand, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a specific range, usually between 0 and 1, to improve model performance. 
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, or crops to existing data.
