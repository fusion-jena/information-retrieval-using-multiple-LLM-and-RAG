The provided text focuses on the architecture and efficiency of the BoTNet model, and doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

To answer your query about handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes the random number generator, ensuring that the same "random" values are generated every time you run your code. This is crucial for reproducibility.

* **Using deterministic operations:**  Some deep learning libraries offer deterministic versions of operations like dropout and batch normalization. These operations remove the randomness, making the training process more predictable.

* **Careful hyperparameter tuning:** Randomness can be introduced through hyperparameter choices like learning rate and weight initialization.  Thorough hyperparameter tuning helps mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance.
