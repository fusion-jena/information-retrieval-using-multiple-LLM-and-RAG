The provided text focuses on the performance of the WTD-GWO-SVR model and compares it to other models like LSTM, BPNN, and traditional machine learning methods. 

It specifically mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance:

* **R2 (Coefficient of Determination):**  Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (DO concentration) that is explained by the independent variables in the model. A higher R2 value (closer to 1) signifies a better fit.
* **MSE (Mean Squared Error):**  Measures the average squared difference between the predicted DO concentration and the actual measured values. A lower MSE indicates better accuracy.
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**  Measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual DO concentration values.  A lower MAE also suggests better accuracy. 


The text doesn't discuss other metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used in classification tasks rather than regression tasks like predicting continuous values like DO concentration.
