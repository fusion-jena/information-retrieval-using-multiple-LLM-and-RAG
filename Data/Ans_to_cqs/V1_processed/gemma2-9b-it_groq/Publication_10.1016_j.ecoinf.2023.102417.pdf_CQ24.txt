The provided text focuses on the challenges of data drift and the application of deep learning for biocrust image analysis. It doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline itself. 

However, I can provide some general information about addressing randomness in deep learning:

* **Random Seed Setting:**  Deep learning models often use random initialization for weights and random shuffling of data during training. To ensure reproducibility, a fixed random seed value is set at the beginning of the process. This makes the results more consistent across different runs.

* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like random cropping, flipping, and rotation are used to artificially increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. This helps the model generalize better and be less sensitive to minor variations in the input data.

* **Dropout:**  During training, dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons in each layer. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.
