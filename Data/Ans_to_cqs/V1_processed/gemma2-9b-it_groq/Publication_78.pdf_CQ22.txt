The text provides information about several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. These include:

* **Sensitivity (TPR):**  The ratio of correctly predicted bleached corals to the total number of bleached corals.
* **Specificity:** The ratio of correctly predicted unbleached corals to the total number of unbleached corals.
* **Accuracy:** The ratio of correct predictions (both bleached and unbleached) to the total number of instances.
* **F1-score:** The weighted mean of sensitivity and specificity.
* **Cohen's Kappa (Îº):**  A statistic that measures the agreement between the classifier's predictions and the actual values, taking into account the possibility of agreement due to chance.
