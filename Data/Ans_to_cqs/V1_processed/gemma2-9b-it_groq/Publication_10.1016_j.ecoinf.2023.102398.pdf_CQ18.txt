The text describes several strategies used to monitor the model's performance during training:

* **Graded MSE convergence:** This technique was adopted to fine-tune the model, suggesting a focus on minimizing mean squared error (MSE) as a performance metric.

* **Training and validation plots:**  The text mentions "final training plots" (Fig. 11) which likely visualize the model's performance (e.g., loss, accuracy) over training epochs.

* **Confusion matrix:** Figure 6 shows the confusion matrix, which provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions across different classes.

* **F1 curve, P curve, PR curve, R curve:** Figures 7 to 10 display these curves, which are commonly used to evaluate the model's precision, recall, and F1-score.

* **Training and validation outputs:** Figures 12 and 13 showcase examples of the model's outputs during training and validation, allowing for visual inspection of its performance.



The text emphasizes avoiding over-training and preventing overfitting and underfitting through careful hyperparameter tuning.
