The provided text doesn't describe the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.  It focuses on:

* **Dataset sizes:**  Describes the use of a large dataset (AT0) and smaller datasets (AT1, subsampled versions of AT0).
* **Model architecture:** Mentions using a ResNet model architecture.
* **Hyperparameters:**  States that hyperparameters like learning rate and network structure were kept consistent across different training scenarios.
* **Evaluation:**  Presents accuracy results on a test dataset (T2) after training.
