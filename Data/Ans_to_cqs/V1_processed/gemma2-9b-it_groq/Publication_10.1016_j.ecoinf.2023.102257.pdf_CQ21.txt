The provided text focuses on the experimental design and results of evaluating an ML bounding box model for tagging efficiency. It doesn't delve into the specific post-processing steps involved after model training. 

However, based on common practices in machine learning, here are some post-processing steps that are often used:

* **Metrics Calculation:**  Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC are calculated to evaluate the model's effectiveness. The text mentions a confusion matrix (Fig. 3) which is used to calculate these metrics.
* **Confusion Matrix:** As shown in Figure 3, a confusion matrix visualizes the classification outcomes, showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
* **Saliency Maps:** While not explicitly mentioned, saliency maps are a technique used to visualize which parts of the input data the model focuses on when making a prediction. This can provide insights into the model's decision-making process.
* **Threshold Tuning:**  The model's output might be a probability score. A threshold is often set to convert these probabilities into binary classifications (e.g., object present or absent).  Tuning this threshold can optimize performance for specific applications.


Keep in mind that the exact post-processing steps would depend on the specific ML model, the task it's performing, and the goals of the project.
