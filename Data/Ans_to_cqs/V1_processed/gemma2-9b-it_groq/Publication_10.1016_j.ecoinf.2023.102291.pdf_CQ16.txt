The provided text describes the process of training and evaluating CNN models but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

It mentions that the "most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training." This suggests that the training process continues until a satisfactory level of validation accuracy and precision is reached. 

However, it doesn't explicitly state whether training stops when validation performance plateaus, reaches a specific target, or when a maximum number of epochs is reached.
