The provided text focuses on the analysis of acoustic data using machine learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  It doesn't delve into the specific methods used for collecting the raw acoustic data itself. 

However, it does mention "PAM (Passive Acoustic Monitoring)" which is a technique used to record underwater soundscapes.  

Therefore, we can infer that **passive acoustic monitoring using sensors** is likely one method used for data collection in this context. 


The text also states that information derived from PAM data is often delivered to the research community and stakeholders long after the sensor has been recovered. This suggests that the data is **stored and then accessed** for analysis.
