The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), for generating synthetic data in the context of ecological informatics. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models in general. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models often include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization/Standardization:** Scaling numerical features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to improve model performance.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
