The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for image adaptive enhancement and doesn't explicitly list the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. 

While it mentions optimization algorithms like Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad), Root Mean Square Prop (RMSProp), and Adam, it doesn't state which one is used or provide details about other hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, or number of layers.
