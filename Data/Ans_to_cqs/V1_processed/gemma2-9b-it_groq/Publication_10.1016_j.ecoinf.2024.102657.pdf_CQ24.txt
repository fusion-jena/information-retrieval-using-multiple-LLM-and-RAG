The provided text focuses on the methodology of the DialectDecoder project, which uses machine learning for bird song classification.  While it mentions training datasets and model architectures, it doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what strategies are employed to handle randomness (like random seed values).
