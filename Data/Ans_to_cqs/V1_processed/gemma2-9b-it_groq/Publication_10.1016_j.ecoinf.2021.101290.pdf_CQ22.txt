The provided text focuses on deep learning frameworks and event-stream processing tools, but it doesn't specify the metrics used to evaluate deep learning model performance. 

However, common metrics for evaluating deep learning models include:

* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. 
* **F1-score:**  The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.

Other metrics may be used depending on the specific task and dataset.
