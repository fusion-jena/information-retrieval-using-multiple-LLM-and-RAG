The provided text focuses on hyperparameter tuning and doesn't explicitly detail the criteria for splitting data into train, test, and validation sets in deep learning. 

However, it does mention the following:

* **Development dataset:** This dataset is used for both training and hyperparameter tuning.
* **Training dataset:** A subset of the development dataset used to train the model.
* **Tuning dataset:** Another subset of the development dataset used to evaluate the model's performance during hyperparameter tuning.

Generally, in deep learning, data is split into three sets:

1. **Training set:** The largest portion, used to train the model's parameters.
2. **Validation set:** A smaller portion used to evaluate the model's performance during training and help select the best hyperparameters.
3. **Test set:** Held out entirely from training and used only once at the end to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

The specific proportions for each set can vary depending on the dataset size and the task.
