The provided text doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.  

However, it mentions "databases" and "caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers." This suggests the data likely involves time-series measurements of caesium-137 levels.  

Therefore, a reasonable guess is that the data format is likely a structured format like CSV (Comma Separated Values) or a similar tabular format suitable for storing time-series data.
