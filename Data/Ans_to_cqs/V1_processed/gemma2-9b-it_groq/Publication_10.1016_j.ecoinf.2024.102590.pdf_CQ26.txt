The provided text describes the data collection process and challenges related to class imbalance in a specific study about land cover classification in Kruger National Park (KNP).  

While it mentions the issue of unbalanced training data due to the nature of the environment (open savanna with low probability of random points landing on woody plants), it doesn't detail specific techniques used to address this bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

The text does highlight the following approaches taken:

* **Targeted Sampling:** Instead of random sampling, vegetation types were used to guide the placement of sampling plots, ensuring representation of diverse vegetation within each boundary.
* **"Add Trees" Geometry:** A separate geometry was created to add well-defined examples of woody cover elements, balancing the number of training points for the two classes ("woody" and "non-woody").

However, it doesn't explicitly mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, which are commonly used in deep learning to handle class imbalance.
