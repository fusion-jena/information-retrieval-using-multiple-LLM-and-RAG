The provided text states that the deep learning models were used for **image classification**. 

It mentions that the classification layer of the pre-trained models was replaced for fine-tuning them on the crop-weed dataset. This implies that the models were trained to categorize images into different classes, likely distinguishing between crops and weeds.
