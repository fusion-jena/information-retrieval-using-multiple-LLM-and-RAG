The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology and doesn't specify the exact methods used for collecting raw data. 

It mentions using "continuous climate data" and "long-term climate averages" as examples of data used for training deep learning models. It also refers to "raw time series data"  but doesn't elaborate on the sources of this data.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively answer what methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
