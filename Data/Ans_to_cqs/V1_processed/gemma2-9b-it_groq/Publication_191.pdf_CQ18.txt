The provided text describes different training strategies for various network architectures. 

For the convolutional neural network (CNN) described in section 4.1, the learning rate was decreased by a factor of 10 every 20,000 iterations and training stopped after 100,000 iterations.  

For the deconvolutional network described in section 4.2, the learning rate was decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stopped improving. 


The text doesn't explicitly state how the model performance was monitored during training beyond these learning rate adjustments.
