The text describes several measures taken to improve the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **Data Augmentation:** The training dataset was augmented 10 times, resulting in 31,320 images from the original 3,132. This increases the diversity of the training data and helps the model learn more robust features.
* **Splitting into Training, Validation, and Test Sets:** The data was split into training (80%), validation (20%), and test sets. This allows for evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting to the training set.
* **Swap of Misclassified Datasets:**  The model was retrained after swapping the misclassified images from the training and validation sets. This helps the model learn from its mistakes and improve its accuracy.
* **Five-Fold Cross-Validation:** This technique was used to further verify the model's predictive performance. The data is divided into five folds, and the model is trained and tested five times, each time using a different fold for testing. This provides a more robust evaluation of the model's ability to generalize to new data.
