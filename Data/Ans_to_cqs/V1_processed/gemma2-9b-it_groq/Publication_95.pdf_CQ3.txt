The provided text focuses on the impact of annotation size on the performance of ResNet50V2 models for classifying IAPS (presumably a type of image dataset). It doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques were employed (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation).
