The text states that the dataset was split into two subsets: a training dataset (75%) and a validation dataset (25%).  The training dataset was used to train the model, while the validation dataset was used to evaluate its performance.  

The performance of the model was assessed using several metrics: adj_R2, RMSE, MAE, and KGE. These metrics were calculated both for the training data and the validation data.
