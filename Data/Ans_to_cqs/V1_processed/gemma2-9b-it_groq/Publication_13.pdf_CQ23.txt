The provided text describes the experimental setup for training and evaluating a deep learning model for image classification.  

It mentions using three datasets (GH, LH, LL) and training the model in a "between-dataset prediction" scenario, where a model trained on one dataset (source) is used to predict images from a different dataset (target).  

However, the text **does not** explicitly state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:** While the text mentions three datasets, it doesn't elaborate on the diversity within each dataset (e.g., variety of species, habitats, image qualities).
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe any cross-validation techniques used to train and evaluate the model.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting of the datasets into training and testing sets. 


Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
