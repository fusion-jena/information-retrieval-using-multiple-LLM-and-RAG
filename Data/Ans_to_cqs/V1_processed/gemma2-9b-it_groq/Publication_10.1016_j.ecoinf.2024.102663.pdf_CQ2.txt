Based on the provided text, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is **image**. 

The text repeatedly mentions using images of fish for training deep learning models to estimate biomass.  It also discusses techniques like image preprocessing, object detection algorithms (including YOLO), and using underwater films for fish biomass estimation, all of which point to image data as the core input. 


While the text doesn't explicitly state the use of other data formats like audio or video, it's possible they could be involved in a broader context not covered in these excerpts.
