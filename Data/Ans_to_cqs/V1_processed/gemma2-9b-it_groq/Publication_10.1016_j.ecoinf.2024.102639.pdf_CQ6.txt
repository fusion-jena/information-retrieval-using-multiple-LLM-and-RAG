The provided text focuses on the integration of machine learning and deep learning in animal behavior studies, particularly within the context of T-maze experiments. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common preprocessing steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for deep learning models.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips) can improve generalization.


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
