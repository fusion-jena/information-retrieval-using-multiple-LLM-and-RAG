The provided text focuses on the model development process using hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters (chlorophyll-a and TSS). It describes the data sources, preprocessing, and the machine learning algorithms (PCR, PLSR, and RF) employed. 

However, the text doesn't delve into the post-processing steps after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These are used to visualize which parts of the input data (hyperspectral bands) are most influential in the model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about specific post-processing steps.
