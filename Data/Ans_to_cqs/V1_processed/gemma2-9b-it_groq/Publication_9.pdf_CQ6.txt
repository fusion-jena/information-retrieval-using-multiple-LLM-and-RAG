The provided text focuses on the training and application of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis, particularly in the context of fish segmentation. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps for image data used in deep learning include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to improve model stability and convergence.
* **Resizing:** Adjusting image dimensions to a consistent size required by the model.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, crops, and color adjustments.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant information from images. This might involve techniques like median filtering or thresholding.
