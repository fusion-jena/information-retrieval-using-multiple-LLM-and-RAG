The provided text focuses on addressing sampling bias in species distribution models, not deep learning. It discusses techniques like transforming presence and background datasets to achieve a more uniform distribution and minimize the impact of biased data on model performance. 

While some of these concepts might have parallels in deep learning, the text doesn't directly address techniques used for data bias mitigation in deep learning pipelines like:

* **Stratified splitting:**  Dividing data into training, validation, and test sets while preserving the class distribution.
* **Oversampling:** Increasing the representation of minority classes by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic data.
* **Undersampling:** Reducing the number of samples in majority classes to balance the dataset.
* **Diverse data collection:**  Actively seeking out and incorporating data from various sources and perspectives to reduce biases inherent in the data collection process. 


Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the provided context.
