The provided text focuses on deforestation detection using machine learning models and doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.  

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This initializes the random number generator used in various parts of the deep learning process (e.g., weight initialization, data shuffling). By setting a fixed seed, you ensure that the same "random" values are generated each time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This involves introducing controlled variations to your training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to increase its size and diversity. This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of random fluctuations in the training data.

* **Dropout:**  This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  This method normalizes the activations of each layer during training, which can help stabilize the learning process and reduce the sensitivity to random initialization.
