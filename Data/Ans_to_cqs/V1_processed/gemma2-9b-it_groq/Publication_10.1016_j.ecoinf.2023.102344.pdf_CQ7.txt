The provided text describes the dataset used for training a deep learning model but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. 

However, it does mention:

* **80% (240 data rows) used for training the model**
* **20% (60 data rows) for testing**

This suggests a common split ratio of 80/20 for training and testing data. 

It's likely that a separate validation set was used during the training process, although the text doesn't explicitly state this.  A validation set is typically a subset of the training data used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to fine-tune hyperparameters.
