The provided text focuses on the use of Kaleidoscope Pro software and doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model being discussed. 

However, it mentions that the model is used for "automated cattle detection" and that it was able to detect cow calls within a validation dataset. This suggests that the deep learning model is likely used for **detection**, specifically identifying instances of cow vocalizations within audio recordings.
