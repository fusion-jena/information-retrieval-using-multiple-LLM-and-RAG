The provided text focuses on land use and land cover classification techniques and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common preprocessing steps:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, helps improve model training stability and convergence.

* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of pixel values, but it might involve techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) to center the data around zero with unit variance.

* **Cleaning:** This involves handling missing data, removing outliers, and addressing any inconsistencies in the dataset. Techniques like interpolation can be used for missing data, while outliers might be removed or capped based on domain knowledge.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This involves artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, cropping, and brightness adjustments. This can help improve the model's robustness and generalization ability.


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the dataset, the deep learning model architecture, and the specific task at hand.
