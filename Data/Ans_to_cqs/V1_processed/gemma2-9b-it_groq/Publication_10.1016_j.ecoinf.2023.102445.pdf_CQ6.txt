The provided text focuses on the architecture and experimental design of a specific deep learning model (YOLOv8) and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved in training. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to improve training stability and speed.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, crops, and color adjustments. This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the data. This can involve techniques like removing duplicate entries, handling missing values, and filtering out corrupted data points.
* **Resizing:**  Adjusting the dimensions of images to a consistent size required by the model's input layer.
