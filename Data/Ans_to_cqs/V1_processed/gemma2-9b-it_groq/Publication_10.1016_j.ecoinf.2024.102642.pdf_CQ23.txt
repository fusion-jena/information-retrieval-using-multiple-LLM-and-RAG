The provided text focuses on the annotation process and the challenges of using expert and novice annotations for training deep learning models. It doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the trained models, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While the text mentions using data from both SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale Dcalls, it doesn't elaborate on the diversity within these datasets (e.g., different recording locations, environmental conditions, individual animals).
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't describe any cross-validation techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the data was split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
