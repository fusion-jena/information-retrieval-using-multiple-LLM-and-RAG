The text describes the use of k-fold cross-validation (k=5) to determine the optimal training-test split for the model.  

K-fold cross-validation is a technique that helps ensure the generalizability of a model by:

* **Splitting the data:** Dividing the dataset into k subsets (folds).
* **Iterative training and testing:** Training the model on k-1 folds and testing it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once.
* **Averaging performance:** The performance metrics (like mAP50 in this case) are averaged across all k iterations to provide a more robust estimate of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

The text also mentions that the split with the highest mAP50 value was chosen for the final model prediction. This suggests that the model was evaluated on its ability to accurately predict labels on unseen data, which is a key aspect of generalizability.

However, the text doesn't explicitly mention other techniques like using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting.
