The provided text focuses on a study using a specific animal track identification method called FIT and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models.  

To answer your query about preprocessing for deep learning, here are some common steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., species names) into numerical representations that the model can understand.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips) to existing samples.
