The provided text mentions the use of the following data formats in the deep learning pipeline:

* **LiDAR point clouds:** These are 3D representations of the environment created by scanning with laser pulses.
* **MS imagery:** This likely refers to multispectral imagery, which captures data in multiple spectral bands beyond the visible spectrum. 
* **Sentinel-2 MS imagery:** A specific type of multispectral imagery from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite. 
* **MS point clouds:**  Similar to LiDAR point clouds, but likely originating from a different source or sensor.
