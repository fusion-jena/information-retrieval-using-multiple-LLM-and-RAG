The provided text describes a machine learning model used to predict the abundance of Short-billed Gulls.  It states that the model was trained to make predictions of "gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots".  

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model is **prediction**, specifically predicting the areas where Short-billed Gulls are likely to be found in high (hotspots) or low (coldspots) numbers.
