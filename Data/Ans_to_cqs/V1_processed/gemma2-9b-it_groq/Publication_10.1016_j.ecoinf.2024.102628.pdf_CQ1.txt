The provided text describes the use of ground-based profiling canopy LiDAR (PCL) to collect raw data.  

Specifically, it mentions:

* **LiDAR surveys conducted at high, medium, and low points along a topographic gradient.** This suggests the use of a LiDAR sensor mounted on a ground-based platform to capture point cloud data at different elevations.
