The provided text describes the training process of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. 

However, it does mention:

* **Hold out split for validation and test:** This suggests that the training process is monitored on a separate validation set to assess performance.
* **Tweaking the learning rate:** The learning rate is adjusted to optimize reconstruction quality and prevent overfitting.
* **Annealing the learning rate:** The learning rate is gradually decreased over time using a cosine function.

Based on these points, it's likely that training is considered complete when:

* **Validation loss plateaus or starts to increase:** This indicates that the model has stopped improving on unseen data and may be overfitting to the training data.
* **A desired level of reconstruction quality is achieved:** The VAE is trained to reconstruct spectrograms, so the training process might stop when the reconstruction error reaches a predefined threshold.


It's important to note that these are educated guesses based on common practices in machine learning. The specific criteria used in this particular case would need to be found in the full research paper or documentation.
