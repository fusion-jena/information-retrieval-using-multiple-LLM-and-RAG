The provided text focuses on the performance of different preprocessing techniques (white balance, gamma correction and sharpening, dehazing, denoising, CLAHE) on a YOLOv8 model for fish species detection and biomass estimation.  

While it mentions the potential of deep learning techniques for preprocessing under extreme conditions, it doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are commonly used before training deep learning models.
