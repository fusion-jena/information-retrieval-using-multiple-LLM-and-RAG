The provided text focuses on the architectural design and training methodology of a specific model, particularly highlighting the use of structural re-parameterization and a novel activation function.  

It doesn't, however, specify the criteria used to determine the completion of training. 

Common criteria for training completion in machine learning models include:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:**  When the model's performance on a validation set (separate from the training data) stops improving or plateaus, indicating potential overfitting.
* **Epoch Limit:**  Setting a predefined number of training epochs (passes through the entire dataset).
* **Metric Threshold:**  Training until a desired performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) is reached.
* **Early Stopping:**  Monitoring the validation loss and stopping training if it starts to increase, preventing overfitting.
