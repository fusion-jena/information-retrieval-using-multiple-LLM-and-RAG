The provided text describes the development and application of a deep learning model (IUC-NN) to predict the conservation status of orchids.  While it mentions the use of occurrence records and discusses potential biases in these records, it doesn't detail specific techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. 

The text does highlight the following:

* **Random splitting of data:** The dataset was randomly split into training, validation, and test sets.
* **Cross-validation:**  To account for the relatively small dataset size, 5-fold cross-validation was employed.

However, it doesn't mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to mitigate data bias in machine learning.
