The provided text focuses on wetland analysis using Earth observation data and doesn't specify the exact methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. 

It mentions using Sentinel-2 data and ground truth samples for training and evaluating a cloud detection algorithm.  Therefore, we can infer that:

* **Satellite imagery (Sentinel-2)** is likely a primary source of raw data.
* **Ground truth samples** are used for supervised learning, indicating manual data collection and labeling. 


The text doesn't mention other potential data sources like surveys or public datasets.
