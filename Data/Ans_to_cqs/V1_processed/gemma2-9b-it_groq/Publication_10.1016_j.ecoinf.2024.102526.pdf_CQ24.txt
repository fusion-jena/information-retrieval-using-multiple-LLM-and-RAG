The provided text focuses on defining target populations for biological marine imaging projects and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.  

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This ensures that the random number generator starts from the same point each time you run your code. This makes your results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing images. This helps the model generalize better and be less sensitive to small variations in the input.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.
* **Batch Normalization:**  Normalizes the activations of each layer in the network, which can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of random initialization.
