The provided text focuses on data preprocessing techniques used in a machine learning pipeline for oil palm yield prediction.  It mentions data splitting into training, validation, and test sets (80-10-10 split), hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with cross-validation, data transformation using MinMaxScaler and LabelEncoder, and feature selection. 

However, the text does not discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
