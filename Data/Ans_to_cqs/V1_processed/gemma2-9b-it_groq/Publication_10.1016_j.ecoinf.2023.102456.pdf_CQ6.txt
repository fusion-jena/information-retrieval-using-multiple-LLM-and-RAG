The provided text focuses on a specific application of machine learning in modeling forest fires and doesn't delve into general preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Scaling features to a similar range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve the performance of some algorithms. Common techniques include min-max scaling and standardization.

* **Normalization:**  Similar to scaling, normalization transforms features to have zero mean and unit variance. This can be beneficial for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) need to be converted into numerical representations that the model can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This involves creating new training examples from existing ones by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to the data. This can help improve the model's generalization ability. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of your data and the chosen deep learning model.
