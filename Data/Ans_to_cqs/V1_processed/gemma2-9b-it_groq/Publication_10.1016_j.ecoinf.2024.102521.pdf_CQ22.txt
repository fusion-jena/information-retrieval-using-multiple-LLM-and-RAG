The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for insect detection and doesn't explicitly list all the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. 

However, it does mention **precision** and **recall** in the context of object detection. 

* **Precision** is defined as the fraction of insect-containing bounding boxes among all bounding boxes returned by the algorithm. 
* **Recall** is the proportion of all insects that were identified by the algorithm.

The text also states that the model's performance was evaluated by manually annotating insects in 150 scans, suggesting that **accuracy** might also be a metric used. 


It's possible that other standard metrics like **F1-score**, **mean average precision (mAP)**, or **Intersection over Union (IoU)** are also employed, but the provided context doesn't confirm this.
