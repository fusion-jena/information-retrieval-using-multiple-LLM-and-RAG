The provided text focuses on the implementation details and evaluation of a deep learning model called AIP-OD, but it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the model. 

However, based on the context:

* The text mentions using the YOLOv3 model as a baseline, which is a popular object detection model.
* It also talks about training the model on camera trap images and extracting ecological information like species labels, counts, and behaviors.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model in this study is likely used for **object detection**, specifically identifying and classifying animals in camera trap images.
