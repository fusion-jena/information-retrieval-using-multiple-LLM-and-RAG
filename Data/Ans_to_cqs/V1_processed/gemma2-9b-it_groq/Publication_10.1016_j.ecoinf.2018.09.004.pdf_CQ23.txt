The text describes the use of stratified cross-validation with 10 folds to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms. 

Stratified cross-validation is a technique used to ensure that each fold of the dataset has a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset. This is particularly important in this case because the dataset is not balanced, with one class (Cymodocea) being significantly more prevalent than the others. 

By using stratified cross-validation, the authors aim to create a more robust evaluation of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. 


The text does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the diversity of the dataset itself.
