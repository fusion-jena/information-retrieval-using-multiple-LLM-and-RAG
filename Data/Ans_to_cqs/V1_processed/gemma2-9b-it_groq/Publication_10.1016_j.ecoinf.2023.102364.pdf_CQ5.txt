The provided text does not mention any deep learning pipelines or datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. 

The study focuses on predicting Short-billed Gull abundance using a machine learning ensemble approach. It utilizes:

* **Short-billed Gull presence/absence data (2014-2015)** collected through field work.
* **68 open-access predictor layers**, including socio-economic US Census data. 


These datasets are used to train machine learning models, not deep learning models.
