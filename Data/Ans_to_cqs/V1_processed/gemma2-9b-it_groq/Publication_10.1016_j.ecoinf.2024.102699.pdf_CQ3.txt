The provided text focuses on data augmentation techniques used in a birdsong classification pipeline, not data annotation techniques. 

Data augmentation methods aim to increase the diversity and size of the training dataset by modifying existing data points. Examples given include:

* **Time domain:** Gaussian noise, pink noise, time stretching, pitch shifting, time masking, etc.
* **Frequency domain:** Frequency masking, gain, loudness normalization.
* **Spectrogram:** Horizontal and vertical roll, horizontal and vertical flip.

The text does mention that the BirdCLEF 2021 dataset uses "weakly labeled" recordings. This implies that the data might not have precise annotations like bounding boxes or instance segmentation, but rather a general label indicating the presence or absence of birdsong.
