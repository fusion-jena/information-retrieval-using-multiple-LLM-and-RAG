The provided text describes the methodology used to map burned areas in the Cerrado biome using Landsat 8 imagery and a Deep Neural Network.  

While it mentions using spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas, it doesn't go into detail about specific preprocessing steps applied to these samples before training the model. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what preprocessing steps are involved.
