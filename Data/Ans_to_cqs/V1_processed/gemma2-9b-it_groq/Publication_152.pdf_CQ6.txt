The provided text focuses on using a U-Net model to identify the invasive plant species *Heidychium Coronarium* using UAV imagery. It doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for image data used in deep learning include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a standard range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model training stability.
* **Resizing:**  Adjusting image dimensions to a consistent size required by the model.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the dataset size by applying transformations like rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments to existing images. This helps the model generalize better.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant parts of the image that might hinder learning. This could involve techniques like median filtering or object removal.
