The provided text focuses on smart farming and data management in agriculture, and doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning strategies for handling randomness. 

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, I'd need information about techniques like:

* **Random Seed Initialization:**  Setting a random seed ensures that the initial weights of the neural network are the same every time you run the training process. This makes the results reproducible.
* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the network.
* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of each layer, helping to stabilize training and reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.


Let me know if you have other questions about smart farming or data management in agriculture.
