The text states that they use a "deep neural network" for embedding the crops.  It also mentions that "deep convolutional neural networks are a class of deep neural networks designed specifically to process images".  

While it doesn't explicitly say "convolutional neural network" (CNN), the context strongly suggests that the embedding model used is a CNN due to its application in processing images.
