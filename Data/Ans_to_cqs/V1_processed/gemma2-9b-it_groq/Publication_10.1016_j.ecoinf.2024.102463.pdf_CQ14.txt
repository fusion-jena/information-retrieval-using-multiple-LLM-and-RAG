The provided text states that the Hyperband algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters. 

Hyperband is described as a hyperparameter optimization method based on the "successive halving" strategy. It combines an initial random search with a 'successive halving' strategy to quickly identify promising configurations while eliminating those that show inferior performance.
