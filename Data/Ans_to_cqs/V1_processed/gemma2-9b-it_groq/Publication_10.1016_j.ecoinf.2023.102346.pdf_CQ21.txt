The provided text describes the model training process and evaluation metrics but doesn't detail specific post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices. 

Here's what we know about the post-processing steps based on the text:

* **Metrics Calculation:** The text mentions several metrics used to assess model performance:
    * Area Under the Curve (AUC)
    * True Skill Statistics (TSS)
    * Cohen's Kappa
    * Point-biserial correlation (COR)
    * Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC)
* **Threshold Selection:** The "sensitivity-specificity sum maximization technique" was used to determine the optimal threshold for classifying species presence or absence.

The text doesn't explicitly mention saliency maps or confusion matrices.
