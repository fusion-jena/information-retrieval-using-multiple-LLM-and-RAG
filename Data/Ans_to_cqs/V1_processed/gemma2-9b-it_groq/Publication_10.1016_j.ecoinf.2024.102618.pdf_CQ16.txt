The provided text focuses on the methodology of a deep learning model for plant disease classification and doesn't specify the exact criteria used to determine the completion of training. 

However, it does mention that "Fast convergence is noticed in the modelâ€™s response as it converges at the fourth epoch." This suggests that the authors monitored the model's performance (likely using a validation set) and observed that the model's performance stabilized or improved only slightly after the fourth epoch. 

Common criteria for determining training completion include:

* **Validation loss plateau:**  If the model's performance on a separate validation set stops improving or starts to worsen, training may be considered complete.
* **Epoch limit:**  A predetermined number of training epochs (passes through the entire dataset) can be set as a stopping point.
* **Early stopping:** This technique monitors the validation loss and stops training if the loss doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs.
