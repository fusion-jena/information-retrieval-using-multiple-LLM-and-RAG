The provided text focuses on land use change modeling and doesn't discuss techniques for addressing data bias in deep learning preprocessing.  

Techniques commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

* **Stratified Splitting:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets while preserving the class distribution of the original dataset. This helps ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data and avoids overfitting to a specific subset.

* **Oversampling:** Increasing the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples. This can help balance the dataset and improve the model's performance on underrepresented classes.

* **Undersampling:** Reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Actively seeking out and incorporating data from a wide range of sources and perspectives to ensure that the training data is representative of the real-world population.
