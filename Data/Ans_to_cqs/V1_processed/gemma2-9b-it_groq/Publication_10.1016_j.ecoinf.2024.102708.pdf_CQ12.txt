The text states that two widely used object detection models were selected for comparison: YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN. 

YOLOv5 is a convolutional neural network (CNN).  Faster R-CNN is also based on CNNs. 


The text also mentions that TPH-YOLOv5 is a modified variant of YOLOv5 with a Transformer Prediction Head (TPH). This indicates that while the core of the model is a CNN, it incorporates elements of a Transformer network.
