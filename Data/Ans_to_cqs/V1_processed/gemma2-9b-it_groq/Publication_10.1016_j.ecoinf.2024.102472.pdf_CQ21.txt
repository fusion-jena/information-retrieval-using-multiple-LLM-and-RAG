The provided text focuses on the training process of an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting carbon stocks. It describes the architecture of the network, the training algorithm (backpropagation), and the optimization of hyperparameters like learning rate, momentum, and training iterations. 

However, the text does not delve into post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:** These are visualizations that highlight the input features most influential in a model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., depending on the task.
* **Confusion matrix:** This is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what post-processing steps were involved after model training.
