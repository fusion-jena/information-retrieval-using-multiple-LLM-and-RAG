The provided text focuses on the design and optimization of a lightweight deep learning model called SIAlex. It doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  randomness is indeed a common factor in deep learning, often introduced through:

* **Random Initialization:** Weights and biases in neural networks are typically initialized randomly. This prevents symmetry and helps the network learn diverse representations.

* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features.
* **Batch Normalization:** While not strictly random, batch normalization introduces a degree of randomness through the calculation of mean and variance across mini-batches of data.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often use:

* **Fixed Random Seeds:** Setting a specific random seed value for the random number generator ensures that the same random numbers are generated across different runs, leading to consistent results.
* **Weight Initialization Strategies:**  Specific weight initialization techniques like Xavier or He initialization aim to reduce the impact of initial randomness and improve training stability.
