Based on the provided text snippets, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses **image** data formats. 

Several references mention the use of:

* **Aerial imagery:**  Liu et al. (2018) use unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery for wetland classification.
* **Airborne lidar data:** Marasigan et al. (2019) employ airborne lidar data for mangrove crown diameter measurement.
* **Terrestrial lidar data:** Jin et al. (2018) utilize terrestrial lidar data for individual maize segmentation.
* **UAV-LiDAR data:** Peng et al. (2021) work with UAV-LiDAR data for tree height measurements.
* **BEV images:** Pham et al. (2019) use BEV (Bird's-Eye View) images for individual tree detection and segmentation.

These examples strongly suggest that the deep learning models in these studies are trained and evaluated on image-based data.
