The provided text focuses on the model training process, including data preprocessing, augmentation, and the use of ReduceLROnPlateau for learning rate adjustment.  

It doesn't describe any post-processing steps performed after training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which parts of the input image are most influential for the model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the overall accuracy (OA).
* **Confusion matrix:**  A table showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing a detailed breakdown of the model's performance. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
