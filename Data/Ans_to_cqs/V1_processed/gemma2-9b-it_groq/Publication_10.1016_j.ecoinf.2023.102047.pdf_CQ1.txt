The provided text focuses on deep learning models for seagrass analysis and doesn't explicitly detail the raw data collection methods.  

However, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Underwater Imagery:**  Several papers mention using "underwater digital images" and "satellite images" for seagrass detection. This suggests underwater cameras or drones equipped with cameras are likely used to capture images of seagrass meadows.
* **Surveys:** The reference to "Guidelines for the rapid assessment of seagrass habitats" hints at the use of underwater surveys conducted by researchers to manually map and identify seagrass. 
* **Public Datasets:** The text mentions the "LookingForSeagrass" dataset, implying the existence of publicly available datasets containing seagrass imagery.


It's important to note that the text doesn't confirm these methods definitively.
