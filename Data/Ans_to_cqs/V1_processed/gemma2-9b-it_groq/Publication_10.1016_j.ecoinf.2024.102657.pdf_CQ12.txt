The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  

This is stated in the text: "A CNN is a type of neural network commonly used for image classification which includes convolutional layers within its architecture."  The text goes on to describe how the CNN works with spectrograms, which are visual representations of sound.
