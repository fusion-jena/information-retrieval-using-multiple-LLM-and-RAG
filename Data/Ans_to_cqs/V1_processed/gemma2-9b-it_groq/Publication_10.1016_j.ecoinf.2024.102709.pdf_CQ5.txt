The text mentions two main datasets used in the deep learning pipeline:

1. **MNIST dataset:** This is a standard dataset of handwritten digits used for training classification models.  The text states that models 1, 2, and 3 were trained on the MNIST dataset, with some modifications in size and placement to resemble the authors' own data.

2. **Tree Markings Data:**  The authors also created their own dataset from "single-tree point clouds, images of single-trees, and *.csv containing the attributes used to produce the images".  This dataset includes "clusters of numbers (in two different point-thickness settings), labeled numbers, preprocessed images of the numbers". Models 4, 5, and 6 were trained on this dataset.
