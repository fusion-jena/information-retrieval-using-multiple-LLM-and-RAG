The provided text mentions that the performance of the model on the test set demonstrates how well the model can generalize. It also states that the performance of every model was lower on the test set compared to the validation set. 

However, the text does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the dataset's diversity (e.g., variety of samples, image characteristics) is not provided.
* **Cross-validation:**  There is no mention of cross-validation techniques used for model training and evaluation.
* **Stratified splitting:**  The text does not describe how the dataset was split into training and test sets, nor if stratified splitting was employed. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
