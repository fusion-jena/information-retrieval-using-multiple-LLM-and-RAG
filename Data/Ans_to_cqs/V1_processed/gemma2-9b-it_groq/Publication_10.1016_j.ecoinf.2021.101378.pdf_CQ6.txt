While the provided text focuses on machine learning applications in forest ecology and doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning preprocessing, we can generally outline common preprocessing steps for deep learning models:

1. **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), identifying and removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

2. **Feature Scaling:**  Deep learning models often benefit from scaled features. Common techniques include:
    * **Normalization:** Scaling features to a range between 0 and 1.
    * **Standardization:** Transforming features to have zero mean and unit variance.

3. **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Categorical variables (e.g., species names) need to be converted into numerical representations. One-hot encoding is a common method where each category gets a separate binary feature.

4. **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can improve model performance. This might involve combining features, extracting relevant information, or transforming data into a more suitable format.

5. **Data Splitting:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance and preventing overfitting.

Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
