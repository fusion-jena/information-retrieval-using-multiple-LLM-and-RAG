The provided text states that the study uses a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM), which is an unsupervised learning neural network approach.  

While SOFMs are a type of neural network, they are not typically categorized as deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers. Deep learning models generally have multiple layers of neurons, allowing them to learn complex hierarchical representations. SOFMs, on the other hand, typically have a single layer of neurons and are known for their ability to reduce dimensionality and cluster data.
