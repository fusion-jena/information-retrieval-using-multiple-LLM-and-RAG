The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of UMAP, a dimensionality reduction technique, not a deep learning model.  

Therefore, it doesn't mention metrics commonly used for deep learning models like accuracy, precision, or recall. 

The text does discuss metrics used for evaluating UMAP's performance as a binary classifier, including:

* **Area under the curve (AUC)**:  Ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance.
* **Receiver operating characteristics (ROC)**:  A graphical representation of the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
* **Kappa index (K)**:  Ranges from -1 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better agreement between predicted and actual classes.
* **Point-biserial correlation (COR)**:  Similar to a correlation coefficient but applied to binary data.
