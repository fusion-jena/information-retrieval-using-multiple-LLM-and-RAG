The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for land cover classification using satellite imagery, particularly in the context of North Korea.  

While it mentions the U-Net model and the importance of labeled data for its training, it doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used. 

Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
