The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of a deep learning model for bird sound recognition. It doesn't explicitly mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. 

However, it does state that the model used "weight decay of 1 Ã— 10<sup>-5</sup>". Weight decay is a form of L2 regularization, which penalizes large weights during training to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single feature and thus reducing overfitting.
