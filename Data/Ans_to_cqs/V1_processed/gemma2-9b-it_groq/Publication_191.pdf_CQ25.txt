The provided text focuses on the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plant species identification, particularly emphasizing the effectiveness of leaf features. 

While it mentions various CNN architectures like AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet, it doesn't explicitly state the overarching purpose of the deep learning models being used. 

Based on the context, we can infer that the primary purpose of these deep learning models is **classification**.  They are trained to classify plant species based on images of their leaves.
