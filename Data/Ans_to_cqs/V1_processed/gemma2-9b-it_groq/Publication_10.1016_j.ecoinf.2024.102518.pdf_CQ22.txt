The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of machine learning models, not deep learning models.  

It mentions the following metrics for model evaluation:

* **AUC-ROC (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve):**  Used to assess the overall performance of a classification model.
* **Continuous Boyce Index (CBI):**  A metric specifically designed for species distribution modeling.
* **Cohen's KAPPA:**  A metric for inter-rater reliability, often used in classification tasks. 


The text does not discuss deep learning-specific metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
