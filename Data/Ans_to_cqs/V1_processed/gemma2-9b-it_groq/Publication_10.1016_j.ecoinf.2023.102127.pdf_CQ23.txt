The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It does mention that  "appropriate validation metrics are less straight-forward than for single datasets as biases and sampling methods can differ," and that "any validation dataset might not represent the niche and environmental parameters estimated by the integrated model." 

The text also highlights the challenges of using withheld data for validation due to potential biases in both training and testing data. 


It does not, however,  explicitly state whether techniques like diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were employed.
