The text provides the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning model:

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Measures the average absolute difference between the model's predictions and the reference data.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**  Measures the square root of the average squared difference between predictions and reference data. It gives higher penalty to larger deviations.
* **MBE (Mean Bias Error):**  Measures the average difference between predictions and reference data, indicating systematic biases in the predictions.
* **MAE%, RMSE%, MBE%:** Normalized versions of MAE, RMSE, and MBE, calculated by dividing by the corresponding mean values over the training data. 


Let me know if you'd like more details on any of these metrics.
