The text explicitly states that a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** is used in the pipeline. 

Several clues point to this:

*  "The network is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers to extract deep features." This directly refers to convolutional layers, a key component of CNNs.
*  "The three features of F1, F2 and F3 are input into CNN model..." This sentence clearly identifies the model type as CNN.
*  The description of the CNN pre-training model further reinforces this, detailing its architecture with convolutional layers.
