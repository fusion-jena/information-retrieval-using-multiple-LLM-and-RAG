The provided text lists the following metrics for evaluating object detection performance:

* **Precision:**  The proportion of positive samples correctly recognized by the model.
* **Recall:** The proportion of all actual positive samples that are correctly recognized.
* **F1 score:** The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a balanced measure of performance.
* **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** The average precision across all categories of recall.
* **Frames Per Second (FPS):**  Measures the real-time performance of the model.
* **Box_loss:** Assesses the accuracy of the model's predicted bounding boxes.
