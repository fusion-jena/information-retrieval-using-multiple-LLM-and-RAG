The provided text focuses on the architecture and application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection, particularly in the context of UAV thermal images. It discusses the use of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) to address the challenges of detecting small objects due to the downsampling inherent in CNN architectures. 

The text does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
