The provided text focuses on using deep learning for bird species classification within soundscapes.  

Specifically, the authors highlight:

* **Bird diversity data:** The model aims to identify and classify different bird species present in recorded soundscapes.
* **Monitoring and conservation efforts:** This classification data can be used to track bird populations, understand species distribution, and inform conservation strategies. 


Therefore, the primary purpose of the deep learning model is **bird species classification**.
