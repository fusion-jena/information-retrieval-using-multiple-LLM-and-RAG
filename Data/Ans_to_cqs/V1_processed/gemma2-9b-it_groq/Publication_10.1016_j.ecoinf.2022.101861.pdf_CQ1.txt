Based on the provided text snippets, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline likely include:

* **Acoustic surveys:**  The text mentions "acoustically surveying cryptic species" and a "pipeline for identification of bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings." This suggests that recordings of natural soundscapes are used as input data.
* **Sensors:** While not explicitly stated, the use of sensors to capture audio data is a common method in ecological research and could be implied by the focus on soundscapes.
* **Public datasets:** The text refers to "community science data" which could be sourced from public datasets contributed by citizen scientists. 


It's important to note that the provided context is limited and doesn't offer a definitive answer on the specific data sources used in the deep learning pipeline.
