The provided text focuses on the model training process using Sentinel-2 data to estimate Above Ground Biomass Density (AGBD). It describes the data used, the chosen model (linear regression), and the performance evaluation metrics (RMSE, R2, MAE, bias) obtained through testing and leave-one-out cross-validation. 

However, the text does not mention any post-processing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrix calculations, or other specific metrics beyond those already listed.
