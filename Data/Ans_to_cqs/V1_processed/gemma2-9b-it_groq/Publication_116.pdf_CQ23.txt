The provided text describes the experimental setup for evaluating a deep learning model for plant identification.  

It mentions that the dataset was resized to 224x224 pixels before being fed into the network. However, it **does not** specify any details about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Data diversity:**  While the text discusses a biased dataset and an unbiased dataset, it doesn't elaborate on the diversity of the dataset in terms of plant species, growing conditions, or image quality.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling to maintain the class distribution. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
