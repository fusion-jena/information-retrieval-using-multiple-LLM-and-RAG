The provided text focuses on a deep learning system for fish biomass estimation and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  randomness is indeed a common factor in deep learning due to elements like:

* **Random Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly. This prevents all neurons from starting in the same state and allows the network to learn diverse representations.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This popular optimization algorithm uses random samples (mini-batches) of the training data to update model parameters. This introduces variation in the learning process.
* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

**Strategies to Manage Randomness:**

To ensure reproducibility and mitigate the negative impacts of randomness, practitioners often employ the following:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Specifying a fixed random seed value ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of "random" numbers each time the code is run. This makes experiments reproducible.
* **Data Shuffling:** Randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch (training cycle) helps prevent the model from learning patterns specific to a particular data order.
* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch, reducing the internal covariate shift caused by random weight updates.
