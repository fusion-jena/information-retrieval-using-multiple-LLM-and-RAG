The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating deep learning model performance:

* **Accuracy:**  Defined as (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN), where TP, TN, FP, and FN represent true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively. 
* **Binary Cross Entropy Loss:**  This metric is used to measure the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution. 
* **Training Time:**  The time taken for the model to converge to a desired accuracy or loss threshold. 
* **Total Parameters:** The total number of learnable parameters in the model.
* **Total Layers:** The total number of layers in the model's architecture.
