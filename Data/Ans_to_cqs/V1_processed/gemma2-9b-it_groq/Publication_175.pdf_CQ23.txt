The provided text describes the training process and results of a deep learning model for fish species classification.  It mentions using different datasets (AT0, AT1, T0, T2) but doesn't explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability. 

The text does highlight:

* **Training on a large dataset (AT0):** This suggests a foundation for broader learning.
* **Testing on a separate dataset (T2):** This is a basic step towards evaluating how well the model performs on unseen data.
* **Varying accuracy across species:** This indicates potential limitations in generalizability for some species.

However,  the text lacks information about:

* **Dataset diversity:**  Whether the datasets represent a wide range of fish species, environments, and image conditions.
* **Cross-validation:** A technique to assess model performance on different subsets of the data, improving generalization.
* **Stratified splitting:**  A method to ensure balanced representation of different classes (fish species) in training and testing sets. 



Without these details, it's impossible to definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
