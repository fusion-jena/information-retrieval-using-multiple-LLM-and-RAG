The data was split into three sets:

* **Training set (90%):** Used to train the deep learning model (IUC-NN).
* **Validation set (20% of the training set):** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to select the best performing model.
* **Test set (10%):** Used to evaluate the final performance of the selected model on unseen data. 

Cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation set 5 times to get an average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy.
