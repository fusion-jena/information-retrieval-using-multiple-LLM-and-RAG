Based on the provided context, I cannot give a definitive answer to what regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. 

The text focuses on topics like particle filters, GPU programming, and ecological informatics. It does mention deep learning tools like Keras but doesn't delve into the specifics of regularization techniques.
