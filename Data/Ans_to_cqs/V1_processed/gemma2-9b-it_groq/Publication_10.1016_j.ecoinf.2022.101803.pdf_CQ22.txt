The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of machine learning models, particularly those based on random forests and Gaussian function regression (GFR), rather than deep learning models.  

The metrics mentioned for evaluating these models are:

* **R2:**  A measure of how well the model fits the data. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
* **R2_DEV:** A modified R2 score specifically designed for count data, based on residual deviance.

The text does not discuss deep learning-specific metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
