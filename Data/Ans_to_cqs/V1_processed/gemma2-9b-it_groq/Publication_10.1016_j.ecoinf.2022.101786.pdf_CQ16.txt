The provided text states that training is complete when the performance on the validation and training sets start to diverge. This divergence indicates that the CNN is overfitting, meaning it has become too specialized at predicting the training set and is less able to predict the validation set (generalization). 

The text mentions that training took approximately 6000 iterations to complete.  It does not, however, specify if a validation loss plateau was used as a stopping criterion.
