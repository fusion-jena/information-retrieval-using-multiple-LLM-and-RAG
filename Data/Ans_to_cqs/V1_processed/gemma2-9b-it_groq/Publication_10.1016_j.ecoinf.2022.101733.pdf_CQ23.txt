The provided text describes the dataset used for training and validation, mentioning a 60%-40% split and the careful checking of samples for accuracy. However, it does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While the text mentions checking for mis-collected samples, it doesn't elaborate on the diversity of the dataset in terms of representing different classes, locations, or time periods.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention any cross-validation techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Similarly, there's no information about whether the dataset was split into training and validation sets using stratified sampling to maintain the class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
