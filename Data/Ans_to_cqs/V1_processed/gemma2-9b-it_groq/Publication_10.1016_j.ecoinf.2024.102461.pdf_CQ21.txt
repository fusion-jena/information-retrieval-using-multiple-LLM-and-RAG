The provided text focuses on the methodology of fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. It describes the process of data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and validation. 

However, it doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency map generation, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction.  These are common techniques used in machine learning after model training to analyze and interpret the model's performance and understand its decision-making process.
