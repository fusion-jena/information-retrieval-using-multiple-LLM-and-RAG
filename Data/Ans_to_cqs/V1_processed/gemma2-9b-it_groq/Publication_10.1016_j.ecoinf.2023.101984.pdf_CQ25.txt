The provided text describes a MaxEnt model, not a deep learning model.  It focuses on explaining the occurrence of two oak species (Quercus pubescens Willd. and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex) based on environmental and territorial variables. 

The text doesn't explicitly state the model's purpose, but based on its description and the analysis presented (percent contribution and permutation importance), it's likely used for **species distribution modeling**. This means the model aims to predict the suitable geographic areas where these oak species are likely to occur based on the factors listed in the table.
