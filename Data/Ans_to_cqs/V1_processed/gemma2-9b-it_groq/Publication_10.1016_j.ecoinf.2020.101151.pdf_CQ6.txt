The provided text focuses on wildfire risk assessment and doesn't contain information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

To answer your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning models, here are some common techniques:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Standardization:**  Centering data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This helps features with different scales contribute equally.
* **One-Hot Encoding:**  Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that the model can understand.
* **Missing Value Imputation:**  Filling in missing data points using techniques like mean/median imputation or more advanced methods.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially capture more relevant information.
* **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
