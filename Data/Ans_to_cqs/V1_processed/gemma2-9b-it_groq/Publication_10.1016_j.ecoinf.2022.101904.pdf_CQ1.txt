The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning, specifically transformers, for wetland mapping. It doesn't delve into the methods used for collecting raw data in a general deep learning pipeline.  

To answer your query, raw data for deep learning is collected using various methods:

* **Surveys:**  Structured questionnaires or interviews can gather labeled data for specific tasks, like sentiment analysis or customer feedback.
* **Sensors:**  Devices like cameras, microphones, GPS trackers, and environmental sensors collect continuous streams of data, which can be used for tasks like object detection, speech recognition, or weather forecasting.
* **Public Datasets:**  Many organizations and researchers make large datasets publicly available for various purposes. These can include image datasets (e.g., ImageNet), text corpora (e.g., Wikipedia), and sensor data from projects like OpenWeatherMap.
