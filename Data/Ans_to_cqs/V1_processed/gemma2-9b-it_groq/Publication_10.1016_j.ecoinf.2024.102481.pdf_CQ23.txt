The provided text does not describe the specific methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It does mention that the model was evaluated using an out-of-bag (OOB) error rate and a confusion matrix with metrics like precision, sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. 

However, it doesn't detail techniques like:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the training data represented a wide range of fish sizes, species variations, or environmental conditions.
* **Cross-validation:**  How the data was split into training and testing sets, or if techniques like k-fold cross-validation were employed.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Whether the data was divided into subsets while preserving the proportions of different maturity stages. 


Without this information, we cannot conclude what measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
