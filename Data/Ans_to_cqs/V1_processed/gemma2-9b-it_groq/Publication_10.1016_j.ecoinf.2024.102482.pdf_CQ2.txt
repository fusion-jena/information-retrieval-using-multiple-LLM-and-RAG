Based on the provided context, deep learning is applied to various data formats in ecological research. 

Here are some examples:

* **Image:**  The paper "BivalveNet: a hybrid deep neural network for common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) geographical traceability based on shell image analysis" (Concepcion et al., 2023) uses shell images for geographical traceability.
* **Audio:** The text mentions "vocalization detection of the North Atlantic right whale" (Padovese et al., 2023) and "bird vocalization recognition" (Xie et al., 2023), indicating the use of audio data.
* **Time-series:** The paper "Comparative evaluation of LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches" (Mortezavi et al., 2023) uses time-series data for streamflow forecasting. This likely involves numerical data points collected over time.

The context also suggests the use of **CSV** format for storing and processing data, as it is a common format for tabular data.


It's important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and other data formats might be used in deep learning applications within ecology.
