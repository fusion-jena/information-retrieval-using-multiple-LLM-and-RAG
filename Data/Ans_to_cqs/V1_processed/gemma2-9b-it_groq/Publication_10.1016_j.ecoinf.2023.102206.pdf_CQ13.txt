The provided text does not specify the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. It focuses on the  IFTL (Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning) method and its application with different Transferable User Representations (TUR) like ELM, GRNN, and SVR. 

While the text mentions  Î³ (gamma) as a hyperparameter for IFTL, it is set to a constant value of 10% and its specific role within the deep learning model is not elaborated.
