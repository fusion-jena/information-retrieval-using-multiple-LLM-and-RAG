The provided text focuses on the challenges of data drift and the application of deep learning for biocrust analysis. It doesn't delve into specific preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent overfitting to a specific class and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances of underrepresented classes to balance the dataset. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can create synthetic samples for minority classes.

* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. Care must be taken to avoid removing important information from the majority class.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This is a proactive approach that aims to collect data from a wide range of sources and represent different demographics, viewpoints, or situations. This helps mitigate bias introduced during data collection.



It's important to note that the best technique for addressing data bias depends on the specific dataset and the nature of the bias.
