The provided text describes the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for air quality prediction.  

While it doesn't explicitly state the model's purpose as "classification," "segmentation," or "detection,"  it heavily implies that the purpose is **regression**. 

Here's why:

* **Loss Function:** The text mentions the use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. MSE is a common loss function used in regression tasks where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value (like air quality concentration).
* **Input and Output:** The description talks about a "temporal window" of input data and output neurons for predicting air quality concentration. This suggests a prediction of a continuous numerical value.


Therefore, based on the information given, the deep learning model's purpose is likely **regression**, specifically predicting air quality concentration.
