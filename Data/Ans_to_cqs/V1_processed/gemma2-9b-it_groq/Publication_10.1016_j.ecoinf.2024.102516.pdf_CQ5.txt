The text mentions the use of a dedicated plant cover dataset for training the ResNet50 model with FPN. It also refers to the ImageNet dataset as a pre-trained classification dataset used for comparison. 

Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are:

* A dedicated plant cover dataset.
* ImageNet.
