The provided text lists the following data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline:

* **HSV adjustment:** Modifies the image's hue, saturation, and value components.
* **Rotation:** Randomly rotates the image within a specific range.
* **Scaling:** Changes the size of the image while maintaining its aspect ratio.
* **Cropping:** Randomly crops a portion of the image.
* **Flipping:** Horizontally flips the image.
* **Mosaicking:** Combines multiple randomly cropped, resized, and rotated images to create a single image, enhancing the background of the identified object.
