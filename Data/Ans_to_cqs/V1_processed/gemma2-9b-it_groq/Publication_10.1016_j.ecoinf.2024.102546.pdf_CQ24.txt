Several strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

* **Random Seed Setting:**  A common practice is to set a fixed random seed value at the beginning of the training process. This ensures that the random initialization of weights, shuffling of data, and other random operations are reproducible. By using the same seed, you can obtain consistent results across multiple runs.

* **Weight Initialization Techniques:**  Different weight initialization techniques, such as Xavier or He initialization, aim to reduce the impact of random weight values on the learning process. These methods initialize weights in a way that promotes stable and faster convergence.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Data augmentation techniques introduce controlled randomness during the training process. This involves applying transformations like rotations, flips, crops, and color adjustments to the training data. Data augmentation helps to increase the diversity of the training set and reduce overfitting, making the model more robust to variations in input data.

* **Dropout:**  Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  Batch normalization normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This helps to stabilize the learning process and reduce the sensitivity to the initialization of weights.



These strategies help mitigate the negative effects of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, leading to more reliable and reproducible results.
