The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of a specific deep learning model for species distribution modeling. It doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved before training. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding). 


Let me know if you have other questions about the provided text or deep learning in general.
