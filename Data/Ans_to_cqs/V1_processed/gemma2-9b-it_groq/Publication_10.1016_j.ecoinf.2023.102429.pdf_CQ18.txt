The provided text describes the methods used to evaluate model performance *after* training, not during training.  

It mentions using parameters like R-squared (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Ratio of Performance to Deviation (RPD), and Ratio of Performance to Interquartile Range (RPIQ) to assess the accuracy of the calibrated and validated models. 

However, it does not explain how model performance was monitored *during* the training process.
