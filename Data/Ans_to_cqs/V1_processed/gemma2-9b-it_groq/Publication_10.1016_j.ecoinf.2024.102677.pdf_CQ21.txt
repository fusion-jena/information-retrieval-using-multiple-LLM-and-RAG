The provided text focuses on the model training process and doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 

It does mention:

* **Evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated for the testing set to assess the model's performance.
* **Visualization:** Figure 4 displays the F1-scores of different landscape categories across all networks.

However, it doesn't describe how these metrics were calculated or if any other visualizations like confusion matrices were generated.
