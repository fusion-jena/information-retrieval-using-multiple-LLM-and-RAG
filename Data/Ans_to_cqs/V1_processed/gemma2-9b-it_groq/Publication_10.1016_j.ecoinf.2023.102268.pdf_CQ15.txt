The provided text does not specify the exact optimization techniques used to train the ResNet-50 model.  While it mentions that the SVM classifier was trained using the ResNet-50 activations, it doesn't detail the optimization algorithm used for the initial pre-training of ResNet-50 or for fine-tuning it on the boatwhistle dataset.
