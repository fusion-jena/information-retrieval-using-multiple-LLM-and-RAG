The provided text focuses on using LiDAR data and deep learning for analyzing forest structure and doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This is a fundamental practice. By initializing the random number generator with a specific seed value, you ensure that the same "random" numbers are generated each time you run your code. This makes your results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This involves introducing controlled variations into your training data (e.g., slight rotations, translations, or color adjustments). This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where a percentage of neurons in a layer are randomly "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This helps stabilize the learning process and reduce the sensitivity to initial weight values.

Keep in mind that some randomness is inherent in deep learning algorithms (e.g., weight initialization). The goal is to manage and control this randomness to ensure reliable and reproducible results.
