The provided text focuses on describing Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and their application in ecological informatics. It doesn't delve into the specific methods used for optimizing the hyperparameters of SVM models. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about how the hyperparameters are optimized (e.g., grid search, random search) based on the given context.
