While the provided text focuses on the architectural modifications made to the YOLOv8 model, it doesn't explicitly state the overall purpose of the deep learning model. 

However, based on the context clues, we can infer that the model is likely designed for **object detection**. 

Here's why:

*  The text mentions "NBSB detection and counting," which strongly suggests an object detection task.
*  YOLOv8 is a well-known object detection algorithm.


Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the deep learning model described in the text is primarily used for object detection.
