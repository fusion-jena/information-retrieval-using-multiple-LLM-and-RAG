The provided text states that the performance of the CNN models was assessed using metrics like accuracy, mean squared error, and mean average percentage error.  It also mentions that the accuracy of regression tasks was calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it to the ground truth. 

Based on this information, the purpose of the deep learning model is likely **regression**.  The model is probably predicting an age value, and the accuracy metric is used to evaluate how close the predicted ages are to the actual ages provided by human readers.
