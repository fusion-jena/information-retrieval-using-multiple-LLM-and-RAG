The provided text focuses on the architecture of a deep learning model (YOLOv8) and its modifications for underwater optical image analysis. It doesn't discuss the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. 

To answer your query generally, data splitting for deep learning typically follows these common criteria:

* **Purpose:**
    * **Training set:** Used to train the model, learning patterns and relationships in the data.
    * **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and fine-tune hyperparameters.
    * **Test set:** Used for a final evaluation of the trained model's performance on unseen data.

* **Proportion:** A common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. This can be adjusted based on the dataset size and specific needs.

* **Representativeness:** The split should ensure that each set represents the overall distribution of data, including different classes or features. 

* **Independence:** Data points in each set should be independent of each other to avoid data leakage and ensure reliable evaluation.
