The provided text states that the model's performance is evaluated using two primary metrics: 

* **OA (Overall Accuracy):**  This metric represents the proportion of correctly predicted instances (both wildfire-affected and unaffected areas) out of the total instances evaluated. 

* **Cohen's Kappa statistic:** This metric is also used to assess the model's effectiveness. 


The text does not mention other metrics like precision or recall.
