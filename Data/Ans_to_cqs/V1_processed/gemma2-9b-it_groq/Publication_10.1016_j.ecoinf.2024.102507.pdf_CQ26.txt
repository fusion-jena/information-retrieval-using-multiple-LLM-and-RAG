The provided text focuses on the impact of data reduction techniques on deep learning model performance and doesn't delve into specific methods for addressing data bias during preprocessing. 

While it mentions data imbalance due to varying forest type areas, it primarily discusses:

* **Original data:** Using the original data with varying sample sizes based on forest type area.
* **Data reduction:**  Forcefully limiting the number of samples per forest type, leading to potential sampling bias.
* **Data augmentation:**  Increasing the number of samples for each forest type using techniques like image rotation and overlapping plots. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, which are commonly used to mitigate data bias.
