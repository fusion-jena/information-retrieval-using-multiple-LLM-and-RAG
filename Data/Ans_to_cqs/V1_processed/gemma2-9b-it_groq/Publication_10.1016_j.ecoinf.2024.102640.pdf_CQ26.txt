The provided text mentions the following techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

* **Diverse data collection:** The GreenCam project explicitly aimed to expand the geographic scope of data collection to include a wider range of urban settings, encompassing different types of green spaces and varying levels of urban green density. This helps capture a more representative sample of the real world and mitigate bias towards specific environments.

* **Data augmentation:** Techniques like random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images were implemented to increase the size and diversity of the dataset. This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of potential biases present in the original data. 


The text does not discuss stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.
