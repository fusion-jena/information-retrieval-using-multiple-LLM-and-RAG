The provided text focuses on the challenges of class imbalance in a semantic segmentation task related to forest fuel load estimation. While it mentions data augmentation techniques like horizontal flip, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction to increase the training dataset size, it doesn't explicitly discuss techniques to address data bias during preprocessing like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. 


The text does highlight the use of a transfer learning framework, which could potentially mitigate some bias by leveraging pre-trained models on larger, more diverse datasets. However, it doesn't delve into specific preprocessing strategies for handling class imbalance.
