Here are the datasets mentioned:

* **Caltech camera trap dataset:** Contains 243,100 images for species classification.
* **Snapshot Serengeti:** Contains 78,000 images for species classification.
* **ImageNet:**  Mentioned as a dataset pre-trained models like TensorFlow Lite InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNetB1, DenseNet121, and Xception were trained on.
* **African elephant (Loxodonta Africana) dataset:** Used for fine-tuning models, including MobileNetV2, and incorporating XAI techniques.
