The provided text focuses on species distribution modeling and doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrices. 

While it mentions evaluating model performance using metrics like AUC and TSS, it doesn't describe the process of generating a confusion matrix or creating saliency maps for interpreting model predictions. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about post-processing steps.
