The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for snow leopard identification and doesn't specify the methods used for collecting the raw data in the initial stages of the pipeline. 

It does mention that the work contributes the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research and encourages further data contributions to Whiskerbook.org.  

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what methods are used for collecting the raw data.
