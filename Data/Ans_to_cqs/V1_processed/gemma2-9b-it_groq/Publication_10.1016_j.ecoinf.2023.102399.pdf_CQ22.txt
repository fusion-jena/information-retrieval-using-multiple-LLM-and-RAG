The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Identified accuracy %:** This metric indicates the percentage of correctly identified fish in the images. 
* **RMSE (root mean square error), g:** This metric measures the average difference between the estimated weight and the actual weight of the fish.
* **MRE (mean relative error), %:** This metric expresses the average percentage difference between the estimated weight and the actual weight of the fish.
* **R2:** This metric represents the coefficient of determination, indicating the proportion of variance in the target variable (fish weight) that is explained by the model.
