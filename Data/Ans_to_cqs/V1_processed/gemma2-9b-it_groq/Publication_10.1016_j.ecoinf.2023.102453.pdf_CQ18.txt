The provided text doesn't explicitly describe the strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention:

* **Hyperparameter optimization:** This process involves finding the best values for parameters like learning rate, batch size, and dropout to improve model performance.  The text shows how hyperparameter optimization was used to find the optimal learning rate for specific models and datasets.
* **F1-Score:** The text refers to calculating F1-Scores for different learning rates, suggesting this metric was used to evaluate model performance.

However, it doesn't detail how F1-Scores were calculated or if other metrics were used during training.
