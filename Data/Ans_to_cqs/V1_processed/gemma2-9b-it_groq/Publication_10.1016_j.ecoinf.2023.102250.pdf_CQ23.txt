The provided text focuses on the architectural and technical details of a deep learning model, particularly its use of spectral normalization and LeakyReLU activation functions.  

It doesn't offer information about the strategies employed to ensure the model's generalizability, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Whether the training data represented a wide range of variations and examples.
* **Cross-validation:**  Techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Methods for ensuring balanced representation of different classes in the training and testing sets. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
