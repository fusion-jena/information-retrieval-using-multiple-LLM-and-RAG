The provided text states that the labeled images used for training and testing the deep learning model were divided into three subsets: "training," "validation," and "test." 

The algorithm uses the "training" and "validation" sets to create a statistical model during the training phase. The "test" set images are used in the testing phase, with their labels ignored.
