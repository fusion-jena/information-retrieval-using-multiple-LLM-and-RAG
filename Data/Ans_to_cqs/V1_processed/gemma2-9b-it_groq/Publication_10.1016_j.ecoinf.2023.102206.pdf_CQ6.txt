The provided text focuses on transfer learning techniques and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) can help features with different scales contribute equally to the model.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.

* **Data Augmentation:**  For image data, techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping can be used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.
