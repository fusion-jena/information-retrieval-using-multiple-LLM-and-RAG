The provided text does not contain information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  

While it mentions the use of a pre-trained "ERNIE" model and a comparative analysis of different models (LSTM-CNN, Rostcm 6.0, Simple Bayesian Networks) for sentiment analysis, it doesn't detail the dataset used, data preprocessing techniques, or any specific strategies employed for model evaluation and generalization.
