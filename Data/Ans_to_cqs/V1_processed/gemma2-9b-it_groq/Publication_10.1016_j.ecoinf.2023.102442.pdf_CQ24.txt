The provided text focuses on using deep learning for detecting artisanal and small-scale mining (ASGM) and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common practice in deep learning to address randomness through techniques like:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated each time the code is run, leading to reproducible results.

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data. This helps the model generalize better and reduces the impact of random fluctuations in the training data.

* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This helps stabilize the training process and reduce the impact of random initialization. 


Keep in mind that these are general strategies, and the specific techniques used would depend on the particular deep learning model and the nature of the ASGM detection task.
