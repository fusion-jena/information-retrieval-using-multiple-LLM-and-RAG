The purpose of the deep learning model described in the text is **classification**. 

The text explicitly states that the model was trained to "develop a classifier capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their spectral signatures."  It further explains how the model processes spectral information from satellite images and uses layers like the fully connected layer and output layer to generate predictions for each land cover class.
