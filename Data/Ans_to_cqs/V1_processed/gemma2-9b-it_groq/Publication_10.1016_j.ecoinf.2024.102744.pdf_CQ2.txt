Based on the provided text, the deep learning pipeline uses **image** data. 

The text discusses a CNN architecture for bee image classification, mentions the use of pre-trained DNNs on the ImageNet dataset (which contains images), and shows results for pollen-bearing bee detection using YOLOv5 and Faster RCNN models, both of which are commonly used for object detection in images.
