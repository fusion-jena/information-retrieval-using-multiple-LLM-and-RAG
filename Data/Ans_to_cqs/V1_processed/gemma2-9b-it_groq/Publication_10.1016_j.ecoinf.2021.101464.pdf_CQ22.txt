The provided text focuses on a random forest model, not a deep learning model. Therefore, it doesn't mention the metrics used to evaluate deep learning models. 

However, common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include:

* **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances.
* **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
* **Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total actual positive observations.
* **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
* **AUC (Area Under the Curve):**  Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes. 



Let me know if you have any other questions about random forest models or need information on deep learning model evaluation.
