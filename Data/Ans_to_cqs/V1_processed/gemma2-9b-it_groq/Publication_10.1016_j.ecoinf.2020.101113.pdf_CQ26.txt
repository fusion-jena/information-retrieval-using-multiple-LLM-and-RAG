The provided text focuses on the technical aspects of training a CNN model for bioacoustic recognition and doesn't delve into specific data bias mitigation techniques used during preprocessing. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about techniques used to address data bias (e.g., stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection) based on the given context.
