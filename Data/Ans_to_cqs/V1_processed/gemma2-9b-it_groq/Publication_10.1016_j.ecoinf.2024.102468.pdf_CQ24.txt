The provided text focuses on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.  

Strategies commonly used to manage randomness in deep learning include:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the same random numbers are generated in each run, making the results reproducible.

* **Using techniques like dropout:** Dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training, preventing overfitting and introducing some randomness.
* **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch, reducing the impact of variations in the input data.
