The text states that deep learning models were trained on "x/y values" from GPS tracking data.  It also mentions that the models were structured in R using H2O. 

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely a structured dataset, possibly in CSV format, containing x and y coordinates representing the bird's location.
