The provided text describes the methodology used in a deep learning project for wetland classification but doesn't explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the pipeline, such as random seed value. 

It does mention the use of:

* **Random data splitting:** The data is split into blocks for cross-validation, implying a random selection process.
* **Random sampling:** Smaller areas of 80x80 pixels are randomly selected from the data blocks.
* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" neurons during training to prevent overfitting and introduce stochasticity.

While these elements introduce randomness, the text doesn't state whether a specific random seed is used for reproducibility.
