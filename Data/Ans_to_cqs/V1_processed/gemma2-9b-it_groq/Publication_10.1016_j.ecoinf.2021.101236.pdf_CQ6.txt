The provided text describes the model architecture and training process but doesn't explicitly detail the preprocessing steps applied to the input spectrograms before training. 

We know the input is a single-channel mel spectrogram of size 64 Ã— 384, visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz.  

The text mentions:

* **"a preprocessing block transformed the original input spectrogram"** before it enters the residual stacks. 

However, it doesn't specify what transformations this block performs.  Possible preprocessing steps commonly used with audio data include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling the amplitude of the audio signal to a specific range (e.g., -1 to 1).
* **Scaling:** Adjusting the magnitude of the features extracted from the spectrogram.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise or unwanted artifacts from the audio signal.
* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating additional features from the spectrogram that might be beneficial for the model.



Without further information from the source, we can't definitively say which preprocessing steps were used.
