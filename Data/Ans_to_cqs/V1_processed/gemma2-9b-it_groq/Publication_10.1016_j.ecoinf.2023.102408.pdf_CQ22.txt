The text mentions using the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models:

* **R2:**  This metric represents the coefficient of determination and indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (AGB) that is explained by the independent variables in the model. 
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** This metric calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted AGB values and the observed AGB values.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** This metric is the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted and observed AGB values. 


The text does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics.
