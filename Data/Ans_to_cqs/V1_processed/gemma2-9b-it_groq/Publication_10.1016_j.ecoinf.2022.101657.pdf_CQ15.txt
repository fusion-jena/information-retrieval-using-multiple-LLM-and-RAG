The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in camera trap analysis, particularly for species identification and reducing empty images.  

While it mentions the use of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation (Zhu et al., 2017), it doesn't delve into specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline like SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.
