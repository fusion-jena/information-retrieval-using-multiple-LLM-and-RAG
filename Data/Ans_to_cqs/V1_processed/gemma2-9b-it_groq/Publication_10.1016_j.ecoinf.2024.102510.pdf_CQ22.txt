The provided text lists the following metrics for evaluating the performance of classification deep learning models:

* **Validation Accuracy:**  Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances in the validation dataset.
* **Precision:**  Quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall:**  Also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, it measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-Score:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a model's performance.
