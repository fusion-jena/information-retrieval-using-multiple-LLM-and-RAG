The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation and architecture of various object detection models, particularly a model called NBR-DF-YOLOv5. It doesn't delve into the strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  randomness is indeed a common factor in deep learning due to elements like:

* **Random Initialization:**  Weights of neural network layers are often initialized randomly.
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This optimization algorithm uses random samples (mini-batches) of data to update model weights.
* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often employ techniques like:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Specifying a fixed random seed value ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers each time the code is run. This helps in reproducing experiments and comparing results.
* **Data Shuffling:** Randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch prevents the model from learning patterns based on the order of data samples.
