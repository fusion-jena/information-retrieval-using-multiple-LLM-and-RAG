The provided text focuses on the model training process, particularly comparing zero-start and incremental training methods. It describes the evaluation metrics used (overall error, commission error, omission error) and how they were calculated. 

However, it doesn't mention any post-processing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrix calculation, or other techniques applied after the model training is complete.
