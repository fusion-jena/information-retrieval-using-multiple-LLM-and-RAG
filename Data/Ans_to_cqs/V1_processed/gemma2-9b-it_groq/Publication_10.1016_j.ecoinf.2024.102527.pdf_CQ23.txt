The text mentions that the authors kept the integrity of camera trap image events during data splitting.  Since images within the same event are similar, splitting events into training and test sets could lead to poor generalization.  

The text does not describe the use of other techniques to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
