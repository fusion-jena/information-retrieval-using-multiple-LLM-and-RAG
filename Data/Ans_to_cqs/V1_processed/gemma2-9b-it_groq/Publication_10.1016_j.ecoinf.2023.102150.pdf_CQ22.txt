The text states that the model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Accuracy:** Calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of images.
* **Precision:**  Defined as TP / (TP + FP) where TP represents True Positives and FP represents False Positives.
* **Recall:** Defined as TP / (TP + FN) where TP represents True Positives and FN represents False Negatives.
* **F1 Score:** Calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
