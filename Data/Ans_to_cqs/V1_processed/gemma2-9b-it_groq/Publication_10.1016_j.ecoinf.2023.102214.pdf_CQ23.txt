The provided text describes the model training and evaluation process but doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:** While the text states the dataset is the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset, it doesn't elaborate on the diversity of the dataset in terms of geographic location, age, sex, or other relevant factors.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling to maintain the class distribution. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
