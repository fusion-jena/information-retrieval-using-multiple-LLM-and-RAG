The provided text describes the dataset creation and model training process but doesn't explicitly mention a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. 

It does state that:

* The model was trained for 50-60 epochs using a GPU.
* A validation dataset (19,614 images) was used to test different model and taxon bias.

It's possible that the performance was monitored on the validation set after each epoch or at regular intervals during training. However, the text doesn't confirm this.
