The provided text states that the best model with transfer learning was chosen based on the minimum total loss after nine epochs.  

It also mentions that overfitting was observed after nine epochs, indicated by an increasing difference between training and validation loss. 


Therefore, the primary criterion used to determine the end of training was the minimum total loss achieved after nine epochs.
