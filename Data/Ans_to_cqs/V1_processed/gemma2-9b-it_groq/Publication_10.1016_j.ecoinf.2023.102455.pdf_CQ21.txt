The provided text focuses on model architectures, training phases, and performance metrics (R, RMSE, MAPE) for various machine learning models.  

It does not contain information about post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing feature importance.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Beyond R, RMSE, and MAPE, other metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) might be used.
* **Confusion matrix:**  Analyzing classification performance by showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
