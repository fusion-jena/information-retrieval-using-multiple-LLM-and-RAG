The provided text does not describe the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the Random Forest (RF) model. 

It does mention that a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation was used to find the optimal parameters for the model.  This suggests that the training process likely continued until the model's performance on the validation set stopped improving significantly.
