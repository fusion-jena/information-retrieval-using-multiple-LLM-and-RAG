The provided text focuses on machine learning algorithms for habitat suitability prediction and doesn't delve into the specifics of preprocessing for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Transforming features to a similar scale to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. Common techniques include standardization (z-score normalization) and min-max scaling.
* **Normalization:**  Scaling features to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to improve model convergence and performance.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand. Techniques include one-hot encoding and label encoding.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops for images).

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
