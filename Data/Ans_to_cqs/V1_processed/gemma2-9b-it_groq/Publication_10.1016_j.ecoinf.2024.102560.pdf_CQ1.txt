The provided text focuses on the study of Lake Urmia and doesn't delve into the specifics of a deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in such a pipeline. 

However, it does mention the use of:

* **CMAP precipitation datasets:** These are derived from gauge data and satellite estimations.
* **Landsat satellite datasets:** Used to analyze water surface area and salinity variations. 


It's important to note that these are specific to the Lake Urmia study and may not represent the full range of data sources used in a general deep learning pipeline.
