The text describes a strategy for selecting the best model, not for monitoring performance during training. 

Here's what the text says about the process:

1. **Candidate Model Generation:** 20 different deep-ANN models are randomly generated and trained on a small subset of the training data (partition At) for 4 epochs.

2. **Initial Performance Evaluation:** The accuracy of these candidate models is assessed using a separate validation data set (partition Av). The model with the highest accuracy is chosen for further training.

3. **Full Training and Epoch Optimization:** The selected model is then trained on the full training data (partition Bt, which combines At and Av) for up to 30 epochs. During this training, the optimal number of epochs is determined using a validation data set (partition Bv).

4. **Final Performance Assessment:**  The final model's performance is evaluated on separate test data for each year (partition T).


The text doesn't mention any specific techniques used to monitor performance *during* the training process (e.g., using a validation set within the training loop).
