The provided text focuses on functional data analysis (FDA) and its application to marine organism acoustic data. It doesn't contain information about data splitting criteria for deep learning models. 

To answer your query about data splitting for deep learning, here's a general explanation:

Deep learning models are typically trained using a split of the available data:

* **Training set:** The largest portion of the data, used to train the model's parameters.
* **Validation set:** A subset of the data used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** A separate, unseen portion of the data used to assess the final performance of the trained model.

The specific proportions of each split can vary, but a common approach is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. 

The choice of splitting criteria often depends on the size and nature of the dataset.
