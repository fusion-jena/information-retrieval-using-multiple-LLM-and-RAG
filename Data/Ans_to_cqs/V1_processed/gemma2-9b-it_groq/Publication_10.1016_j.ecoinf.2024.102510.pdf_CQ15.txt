The provided text focuses on hyperparameter optimization for CNN models in image classification and doesn't explicitly mention the specific optimization techniques used during the training process (e.g., SGD, Adam). 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
