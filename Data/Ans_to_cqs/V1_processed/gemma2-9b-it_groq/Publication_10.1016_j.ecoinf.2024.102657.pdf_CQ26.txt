The provided text does not describe any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. 

While it mentions that 80% of each dialect class is used for training and 20% for testing, it doesn't elaborate on methods to ensure the training and testing sets are representative of the overall data distribution and mitigate potential biases. 

The text focuses on the minimal preprocessing approach taken to highlight the effectiveness of human-machine teaming and compares the CNN's accuracy on noise-filtered and raw data.
