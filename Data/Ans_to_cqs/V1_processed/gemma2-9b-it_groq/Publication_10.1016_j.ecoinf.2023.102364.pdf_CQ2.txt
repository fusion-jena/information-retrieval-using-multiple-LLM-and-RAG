The provided text describes the use of various geospatial and socio-economic data sources.  It mentions:

* **Geographic Information System (GIS) data:** This likely includes formats like shapefiles, GeoJSON, and raster data (e.g., satellite imagery).
* **US Census 2000 data:** This would be in a structured format, potentially CSV or similar tabular data.
* **Open-access predictor layers:** These could encompass various formats depending on the specific data sources, but likely include GIS data formats and potentially CSV or other tabular data.

The text doesn't explicitly state the data formats used for training the machine learning models. However, given the nature of the data sources described, it's reasonable to infer that the input data for the models would be in a format suitable for geospatial analysis and statistical modeling.
