The provided text describes the process of training a deep learning model for ecological prediction using bark beetle outbreaks as an example.  

While it details the hyperparameters evaluated (network capacity, regularization techniques, loss function, and optimizer), it doesn't explicitly mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.  

The text does state that the training of each network was stopped when accuracy on the test dataset plateaued, suggesting a basic form of evaluation on a held-out dataset. However, it doesn't describe techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to improve model generalizability.
