The provided text focuses on a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and doesn't offer information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as a SLSTM (presumably a type of LSTM network).  

To answer your query about deep learning hyperparameters, I'd need additional context about the specific deep learning model you're interested in. 

Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include:

* **Learning rate:** Controls the step size during weight updates.
* **Optimizer:** Algorithm used to update weights (e.g., Adam, SGD).
* **Number of layers and neurons:** Architecture of the neural network.
* **Activation functions:** Functions introducing non-linearity into the network.
* **Batch size:** Number of samples processed in each training iteration.
* **Dropout rate:** Probability of randomly dropping out neurons during training.
