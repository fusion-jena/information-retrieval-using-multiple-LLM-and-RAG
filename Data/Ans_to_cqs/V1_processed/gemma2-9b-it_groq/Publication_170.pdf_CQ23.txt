The provided text focuses on the model's architecture, training process, and performance evaluation based on different training sample sizes.  It doesn't mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:** While the text mentions the BMXSM dataset, it doesn't elaborate on its diversity in terms of species, habitats, or camera locations.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe any cross-validation strategies used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
