The provided text focuses on detecting artisanal and small-scale mining using deep learning and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training such models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization/Scaling:**  This transforms features to a common scale, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This can improve model performance by preventing features with larger ranges from dominating the learning process.

* **Feature Engineering:** This involves creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model accuracy.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:**  Categorical variables (e.g., text labels) need to be converted into numerical representations that the model can understand. Common techniques include one-hot encoding or label encoding.

* **Splitting Data:** The dataset is typically split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model performance. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
