The provided text describes the training process and results of different deep learning models for classifying camera trap images. However, it doesn't specify the exact post-processing steps used after training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Besides accuracy, other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC are often calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 

The text mentions that the best model's confusion matrix is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S10.  It also states that the code and trained models are available at https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/deep-learning-for-camera-trap-images, which might contain more details about the post-processing steps.
