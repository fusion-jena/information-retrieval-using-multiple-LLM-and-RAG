The provided text states that a random grid search method is used for hyperparameter optimization. 

It explains that the Python library's `randint` command is used for hyperparameters like `n_estimators` and `max_depth`, which are typically integers. For discrete or continuous values within a range, like `min_samples_split`, the `uniform` command is employed. 

The text emphasizes that this method examines multiple hyperparameter value ranges to determine the optimal configuration for the model.
