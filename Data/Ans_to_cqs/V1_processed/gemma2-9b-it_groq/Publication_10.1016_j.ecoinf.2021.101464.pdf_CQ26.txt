The provided text focuses on the Random Forest algorithm and its application in analyzing forest microclimate and NAI (presumably Net Assimilation Index). It does not discuss deep learning techniques or data bias mitigation strategies. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
