The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in ecological studies using camera trap data. It doesn't explicitly mention the general methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. 

However, we can infer that camera traps are one method used for collecting raw data in this specific context. 

Generally, raw data for deep learning can be collected from various sources, including:

* **Surveys:** Questionnaires and interviews can gather structured data.
* **Sensors:** Devices like temperature sensors, motion detectors, and GPS trackers collect environmental and behavioral data.
* **Public Datasets:** Many organizations release pre-collected datasets for research purposes, covering diverse domains like images, text, and audio.
