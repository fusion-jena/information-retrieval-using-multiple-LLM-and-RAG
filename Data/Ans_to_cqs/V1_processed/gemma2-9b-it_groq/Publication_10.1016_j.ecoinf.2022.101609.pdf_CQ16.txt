The provided text states that the training process is monitored by observing the training and validation losses. 

Specifically, it mentions:

* **Training loss gradually decreasing:** This indicates the model is learning from the training data.
* **Validation loss dropping significantly and then stabilizing:** This suggests the model is generalizing well to unseen data initially, but then plateaus, indicating potential overfitting.

The text doesn't explicitly state a specific criterion for determining when training is complete. However, it implies that a combination of factors, including the validation loss plateauing and the performance on the validation set, is likely used to make this decision.
