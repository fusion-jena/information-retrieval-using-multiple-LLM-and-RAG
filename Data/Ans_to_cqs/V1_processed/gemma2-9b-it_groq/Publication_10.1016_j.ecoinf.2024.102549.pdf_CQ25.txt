The deep learning model described in the text is used for **classification**. 

The text states that the model "comprises five convolutional layers, one pooling layer; three fully connected layers, and three water-quality level labels including Class I, Class II, and Class III." This structure is typical of a classification model, where the goal is to assign input images (in this case, images of water quality) to one of several predefined categories (the water quality levels).
