The provided text focuses on the application of a Random Forest (RF) model, not a deep learning model, for predicting chlorophyll-a concentrations in Poyang Lake.  Therefore, the evaluation metrics discussed are specific to RF models and not general deep learning metrics. 

The text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the RF model's performance:

* **adj_R2 (Adjusted R-squared):**  Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (chlorophyll-a) explained by the independent variables (predictors) in the model.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**  Represents the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual chlorophyll-a concentrations.
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**  Calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual chlorophyll-a concentrations.
* **KGE (Kruskal-Wallis Efficiency):**  A metric that considers both the accuracy and the ranking ability of the model.
