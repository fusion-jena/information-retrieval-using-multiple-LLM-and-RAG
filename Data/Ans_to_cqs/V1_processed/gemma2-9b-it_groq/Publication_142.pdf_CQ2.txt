The text specifically mentions that the Pl@ntNet project uses images as input for its deep learning pipeline.  It states: "The network is pre-trained on the commonly used ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. Pl@ntNet currently covers 30,261 species illustrated by more than 2.9 million images." 


While the text discusses the challenges of analyzing multimedia data in general, it doesn't explicitly list other data formats used in the deep learning pipeline beyond images.
