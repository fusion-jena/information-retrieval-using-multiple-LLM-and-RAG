The provided text focuses on soil degradation analysis and doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning model preprocessing.  

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is often necessary for deep learning algorithms.
* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance.
