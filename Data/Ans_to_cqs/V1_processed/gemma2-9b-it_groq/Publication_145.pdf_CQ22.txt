The text states that two performance metrics were computed to evaluate the deep learning model:

1. **Overall accuracy:** This is the percentage of correctly classified pixels. 
2. **F1 score:** This is computed for each class and is the harmonic average of precision and recall.  Precision is the ratio of correctly classified segments to the total number of segments (true and false positives), while recall is the ratio of correctly classified segments to the total number of segments belonging to that class (true positives and false negatives).
