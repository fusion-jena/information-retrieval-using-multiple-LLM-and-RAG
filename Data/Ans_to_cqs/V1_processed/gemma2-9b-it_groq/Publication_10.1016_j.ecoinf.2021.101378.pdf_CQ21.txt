The provided text focuses on introducing machine learning applications in ecology, particularly for predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease. It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps involved after model training. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix).
