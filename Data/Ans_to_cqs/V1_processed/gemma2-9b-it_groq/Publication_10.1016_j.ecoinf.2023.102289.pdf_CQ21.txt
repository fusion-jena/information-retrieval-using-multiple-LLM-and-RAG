The provided text focuses on the architecture and workflow of the LaDeco AI platform, particularly its image processing and analysis stages.  It doesn't delve into the specific post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
