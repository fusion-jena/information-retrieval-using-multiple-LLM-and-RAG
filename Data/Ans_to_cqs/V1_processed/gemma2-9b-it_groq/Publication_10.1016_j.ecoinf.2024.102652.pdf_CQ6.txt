The provided text describes the training process of a deep learning model for soil salinity detection, mentioning normalization and standardization of the training data. 

Here's a breakdown of preprocessing steps commonly involved before training a deep learning model:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) helps improve model performance.

* **Standardization:**  Centering the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This ensures features have zero mean and unit variance.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., text labels) into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model accuracy.

The specific preprocessing steps used depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
