The provided text lists several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Accuracy:**  Calculated as (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) * 100%, where TP is True Positives, TN is True Negatives, FP is False Positives, and FN is False Negatives. It represents the percentage of correctly classified instances.

* **Precision:** Calculated as TP / (TP + FP) * 100%. It measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.

* **Recall:** Calculated as TP / (TP + FN) * 100%. It measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.

* **F1-Score:**  The harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall). It provides a balanced measure considering both precision and recall.

* **AUC (Area Under the Curve of ROC):**  Represents the performance of a classification model across all possible classification thresholds.
