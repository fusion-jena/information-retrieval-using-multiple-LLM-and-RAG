The provided text describes the data preparation process for training a deep learning model to identify bird species from acoustic recordings.  

Here's what we can glean about measures taken to ensure generalizability:

* **Pre-training with external data:** The model was pre-trained on acoustic reference data from outside the specific study site. This could potentially expose the model to a wider variety of bird sounds and improve its ability to generalize to new environments.
* **Fine-tuning with ROI data:** The pre-trained model was then fine-tuned using ROIs (regions of interest) from the study site. This targeted training helps the model specialize in the specific bird species and sounds relevant to the study.
* **Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets:** The data was divided into three sets: training, validation, and test. The training set was used to train the model, the validation set was used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set was used to evaluate the final model performance on unseen data. This separation helps prevent overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new data.
* **Stratified sampling:** The text mentions "randomly sampling 50 ROIs per species with “presence” to form a held-out test set" and "randomly sampled 100 of these ROIs per species to form a validation set." This suggests a stratified sampling approach, where the proportion of different species is maintained across the different data sets.

**However, the text does not explicitly mention other generalizability measures like cross-validation.**
