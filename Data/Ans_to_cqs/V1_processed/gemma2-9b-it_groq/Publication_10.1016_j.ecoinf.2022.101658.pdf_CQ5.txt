The provided text describes a study using semantic segmentation for classifying vegetation types in field photos.  

It states that the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was trained using manually segmented nadir images from two field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL). 

Field measurements and raw photos from a third field site, Conklin (CK), were used for independent validation. 

Therefore, the primary datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are the manually segmented nadir images from the PM and CL field sites.
