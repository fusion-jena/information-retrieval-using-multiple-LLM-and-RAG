The provided text focuses on data-driven models, particularly those using machine learning for predicting algal blooms and reservoir stratification. It doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

However, I can offer some general strategies commonly used to address randomness in deep learning:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  A random seed is a starting point for the random number generator. By setting a fixed seed, you ensure that the same "random" values are generated each time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This method normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. This helps stabilize the training process and can reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

* **Data Augmentation:**  For image data, techniques like random cropping, flipping, and rotation can be applied to create variations of the training data. This introduces controlled randomness and helps the model generalize better. 


Keep in mind that some randomness is inherent in deep learning due to the stochastic nature of optimization algorithms.
