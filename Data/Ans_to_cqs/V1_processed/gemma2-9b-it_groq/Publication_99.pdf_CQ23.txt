The provided text doesn't describe specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, such as data diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

It does mention:

* **Pre-training on ImageNet:**  Both PConv and Classification networks were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset of images. This pre-training can help models learn general image features.
* **Data Augmentation:** The Classification networks used data augmentation techniques like height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes during training. This can help increase the diversity of the training data and improve generalization.


However, the text doesn't explicitly state the use of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.
