The provided text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, particularly in the context of bird species classification. 

These include:

* **Accuracy:** While not explicitly defined in the text, accuracy is a common metric in machine learning, representing the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
* **Silhouette coefficient:** This metric measures how well-separated clusters are in a dataset. It ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better separation.
* **Hopkins statistic:** This metric assesses the similarity between two sets of data points. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect similarity.
* **Trustworthiness:** This metric is mentioned but not further explained. It likely refers to the reliability or confidence in the model's predictions. 


The text focuses on using these metrics in conjunction with dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and UMAP to evaluate the suitability of models for transfer learning.
