The provided text focuses on random forests, a machine learning technique, and doesn't offer information about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. 

Strategies for handling randomness in deep learning often involve:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of results.

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing samples.

* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch normalization:**  Normalizing the activations of neurons within each mini-batch. This helps stabilize training and reduce the impact of weight initialization.
