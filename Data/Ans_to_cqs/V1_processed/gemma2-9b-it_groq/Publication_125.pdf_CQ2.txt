The provided text focuses on a CNN model for processing satellite images.  It mentions that the CNN is used for "image-based data processing" and that the default input size for the models discussed is in the format of  "299 × 299 × 3" or "224 × 224 × 3".  

Based on this, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline in this case uses **image** data.
