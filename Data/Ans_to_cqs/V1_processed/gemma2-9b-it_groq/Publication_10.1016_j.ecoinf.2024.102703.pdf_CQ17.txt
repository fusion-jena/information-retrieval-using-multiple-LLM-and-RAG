The provided text focuses on building a three-layer backpropagation neural network for predicting TSI using aCDOM(254), Fn(355), and  evaluating its performance. It also discusses the use of the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) model for variable selection in the context of  predicting FDOM (Fluorescence Dissolved Organic Matter). 

The text does not delve into deep learning techniques or regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization commonly used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
