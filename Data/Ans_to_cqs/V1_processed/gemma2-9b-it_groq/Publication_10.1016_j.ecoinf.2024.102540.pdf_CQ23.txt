The text describes a dataset split into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. It also mentions that the dataset was manually labeled.  

However, the provided context does not specify if additional measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the diversity of the dataset (e.g., different alate species, leaf types, environmental conditions) is not provided.
* **Cross-validation:** The text does not mention the use of cross-validation techniques.
* **Stratified splitting:**  While the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets, it's unclear if this splitting was stratified to maintain the class distribution of alates within each set. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model beyond the basic dataset split.
