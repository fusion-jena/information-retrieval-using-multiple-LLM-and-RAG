Based on the provided text snippets, I cannot determine the specific purpose of the deep learning model. 

The text excerpt you provided discusses the development and implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It mentions the model's architecture, training data, and performance metrics (R-squared value). However, it does not explicitly state the type of deep learning task the model is designed for (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection).
