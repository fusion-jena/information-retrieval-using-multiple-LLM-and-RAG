The provided text focuses on the model training process and performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R2.  It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrices, or detailed metric calculations beyond these two. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
