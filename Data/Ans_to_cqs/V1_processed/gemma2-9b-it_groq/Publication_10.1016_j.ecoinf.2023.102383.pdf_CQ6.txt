The provided text focuses on the architecture and application of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs) in deep learning models, particularly for object detection in UAV thermal images. It doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a standard range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model training stability and performance.
* **Scaling:** Adjusting the range of input features to be suitable for the model's learning algorithm.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant data from the input dataset. This can involve techniques like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting errors.

Specific preprocessing techniques may vary depending on the type of data and the chosen deep learning model.
