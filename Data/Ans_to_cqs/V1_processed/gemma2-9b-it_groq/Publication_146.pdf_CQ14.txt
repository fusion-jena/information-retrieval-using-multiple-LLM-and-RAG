The provided text states that the hyperparameter setting was based on studies that successfully implemented YOLO in remote sensing cases.  It specifically mentions the author of the YOLO-based "Yolt" model who suggests using the same hyperparameters as the original YOLO model.  

The text does not, however, describe the specific optimization method used to determine these hyperparameters (e.g., grid search, random search).
