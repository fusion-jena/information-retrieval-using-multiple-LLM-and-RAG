The provided text focuses on the application of a specific deep learning model (NARX) for vegetation biomass density prediction and doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps required depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
