The provided text focuses on randomized grid search for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning, particularly with random forests. It doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline itself. 

However,  randomness is indeed inherent in many aspects of deep learning:

* **Initialization:** Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly. This prevents symmetry and encourages diverse learning paths.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and promotes the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  Uses random sampling within mini-batches to normalize activations, improving training stability and speed.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  The optimization algorithm used to train deep learning models relies on random samples (mini-batches) of the training data to update model parameters.

To manage randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often use:

* **Random Seed Setting:**  Fixing a random seed value at the beginning of the training process ensures that the same random numbers are generated each time, leading to consistent results.

* **Reproducibility Tools:**  Deep learning frameworks often provide tools and techniques to enhance reproducibility, such as logging hyperparameters, code versions, and data splits.
