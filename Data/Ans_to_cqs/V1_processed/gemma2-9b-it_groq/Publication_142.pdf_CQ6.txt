The provided text focuses on the Pl@ntNet project, a plant identification tool using deep learning. While it mentions that training a deep learning model like Pl@ntNet requires "expertise in deep, distributed, and large-scale learning," it doesn't specify the exact preprocessing steps involved. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the preprocessing steps used for training the Pl@ntNet model or deep learning models in general based on this text.
