The model performance is monitored during training in a few key ways:

* **Validation Set:** A validation set is used, which combines the original base model's validation set with 100 frames per class from the labeled December 3rd, 2019 training set. This allows the model's performance to be assessed across both the training data and the original base model's validation environment.

* **Early Stopping:**  Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting. The training process stops if the validation loss does not improve within 10 epochs.

* **Performance Metrics:** The text mentions analyzing performance metrics across the whole test set.  Specific metrics are not named, but common choices for acoustic classification include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
