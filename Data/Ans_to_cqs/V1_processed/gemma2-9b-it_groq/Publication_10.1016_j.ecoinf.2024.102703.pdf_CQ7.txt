The provided text describes the process of building and evaluating a neural network model for predicting TSI (Total Suspended Solids) using aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) as input features.  

However, it doesn't specify the exact criteria used to split the 64 water samples into training, validation, and test sets. 

Common practices for splitting data in deep learning include:

* **70/15/15 split:** 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
* **80/20 split:** 80% for training and 20% for testing, with the testing set further divided into validation and test subsets.

The specific split chosen depends on factors like the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the desired balance between model performance and generalization ability.
