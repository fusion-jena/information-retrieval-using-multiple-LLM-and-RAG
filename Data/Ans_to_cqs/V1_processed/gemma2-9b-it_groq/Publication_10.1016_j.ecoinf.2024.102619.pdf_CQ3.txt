The provided text focuses on the technical aspects of training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, and it doesn't delve into specific data annotation techniques used in the pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the exact annotation techniques employed (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) based on the given context.
