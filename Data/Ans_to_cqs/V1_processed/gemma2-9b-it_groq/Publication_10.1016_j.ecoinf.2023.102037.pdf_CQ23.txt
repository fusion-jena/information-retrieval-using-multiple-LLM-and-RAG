The text describes a specific data splitting strategy aimed at improving the model's generalizability in a practical setting. 

Instead of random data splitting, the researchers split the data on the "sticky plate level." This means that insects belonging to the same sticky plate image were kept together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). 

The authors argue that this approach better emulates real-world usage, where the model would encounter entire sticky plate images it hasn't seen during training.  

The text doesn't mention other generalizability measures like diverse datasets or cross-validation techniques.
