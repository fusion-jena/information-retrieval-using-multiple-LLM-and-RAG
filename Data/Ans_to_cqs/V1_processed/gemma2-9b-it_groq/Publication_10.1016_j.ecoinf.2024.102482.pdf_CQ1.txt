The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning, specifically LSTM models, to analyze time-series data from *C. elegans* swimming behavior for water quality pollution detection.  

It doesn't delve into the general methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. 

To answer your query broadly, data collection methods for deep learning can vary greatly depending on the application. Here are some common examples:

* **Surveys:**  Used to gather structured information from individuals, often through questionnaires or interviews.
* **Sensors:**  Physical devices that collect data on various environmental factors (temperature, humidity, sound, etc.) or human activity (heart rate, location).
* **Public Datasets:**  Collections of data made available by organizations or researchers for public use. These can cover a wide range of topics, from images and text to financial data and scientific measurements.
* **Web Scraping:**  Automated extraction of data from websites.
* **Camera/Image Capture:**  Using cameras or image sensors to collect visual data.
* **Audio Recording:**  Capturing sound using microphones.
