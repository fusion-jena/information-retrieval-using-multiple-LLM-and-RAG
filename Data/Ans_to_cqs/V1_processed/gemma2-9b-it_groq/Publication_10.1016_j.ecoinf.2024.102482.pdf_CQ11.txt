I cannot find a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline described in the text. The provided context focuses on the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for analyzing swimming behavior in *Caenorhabditis elegans* and doesn't mention a specific data repository for the pipeline.
