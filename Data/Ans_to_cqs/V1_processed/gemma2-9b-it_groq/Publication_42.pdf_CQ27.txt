The provided text focuses on the development and evaluation of different CNN architectures for a specific task (likely moth classification based on context). It details the experimentation process, comparing various model sizes and hyperparameters, and ultimately selecting the best-performing architecture. 

However, the text **does not** provide information about the deployment process of the trained model.  It doesn't mention:

* **Model serialization:** How the trained model weights were saved for later use.
* **Platform selection:**  Where the model would be deployed (e.g., cloud, edge device, etc.).
* **Deployment specifics:**  Any tools or frameworks used for deployment,  infrastructure requirements, or considerations for real-world usage. 


Therefore, I cannot answer your question based on the given context.
