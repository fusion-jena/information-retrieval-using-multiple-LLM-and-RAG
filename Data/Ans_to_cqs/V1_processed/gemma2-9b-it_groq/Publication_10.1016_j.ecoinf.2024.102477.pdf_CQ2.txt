The provided text focuses on the SLSTM model for time-series data and doesn't specify the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it mentions that deep learning methods are applied to "large volumes of complex data."  

Based on common practices in deep learning, the data formats could include:

* **Time-series data:** This is explicitly mentioned as the focus of the SLSTM model. Time-series data is often represented as numerical sequences.
* **CSV:**  CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common format for storing tabular data, which could be used for various deep learning tasks. 


It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the specific data formats used would depend on the particular deep learning application.
