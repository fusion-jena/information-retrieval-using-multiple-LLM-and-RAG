The deep learning model described in the text is designed for **species identification** through the automatic analysis of bird vocalizations (soundscapes). 

The passage states that supervised learning techniques based on deep artificial neural networks are suitable for identifying species from recordings. It specifically mentions a convolutional neural network (CNN) being implemented for this purpose. CNNs are known for their effectiveness in image recognition, but they have also been successfully applied to the acoustic domain for tasks like bird species identification.
