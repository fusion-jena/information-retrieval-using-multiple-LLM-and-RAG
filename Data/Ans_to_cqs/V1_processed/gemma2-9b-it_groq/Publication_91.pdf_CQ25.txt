The deep learning model is used for **classification**. 

The text states: "Analysing the captured set of microscopic images poses a computer vision problem and makes convolutional neural networks (CNN) the proper choice of model to train (Nguyen et al., 2018). CNNs are feed-forward artificial neural networks composed of layers with learnable filters. More specifically, an inception network architecture (INCEPTION v.3) with 48 convolution layers was used (Szegedy et al., 2016)." 

It goes on to explain that the model was trained to classify pollen images into different species.
