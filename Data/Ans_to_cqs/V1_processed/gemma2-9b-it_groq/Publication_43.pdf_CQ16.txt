The provided text focuses on the CNN model's architecture, training process, and performance evaluation. It doesn't specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete.  

Possible criteria for training completion, not mentioned in the text, include:

* **Validation loss plateau:**  Training stops when the loss on a validation set (separate from the training data) stops improving significantly.
* **Maximum number of epochs:** Training runs for a predetermined number of passes through the entire training dataset.
* **Achieving a target accuracy:** Training stops when the model reaches a desired level of accuracy on the validation set.
