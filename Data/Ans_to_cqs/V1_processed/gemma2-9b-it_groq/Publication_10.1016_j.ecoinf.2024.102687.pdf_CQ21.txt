The provided text focuses on the data acquisition and preprocessing for training a model, as well as the model architecture and fine-tuning process.  It doesn't describe any post-processing steps performed after training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which parts of the input audio are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  Showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. 


Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
