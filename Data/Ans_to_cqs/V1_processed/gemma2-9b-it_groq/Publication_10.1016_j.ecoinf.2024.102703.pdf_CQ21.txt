The provided text describes the building and training of a neural network model for predicting TSI (Total Suspended Solids) using aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) as input features.  

However, it doesn't detail any post-processing steps performed *after* the training process.  

The text mentions:

* **Validation accuracy assessment:** This involves calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance on a separate dataset.

It does *not* mention steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are used to visualize which input features are most influential in the model's predictions.
* **Confusion matrix:** This is typically used for classification problems to show the counts of correct and incorrect predictions across different classes. 



Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm that R2 and RMSE calculations were used for model evaluation.
