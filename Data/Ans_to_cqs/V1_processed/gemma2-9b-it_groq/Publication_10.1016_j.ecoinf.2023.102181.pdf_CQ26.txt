The provided text focuses on addressing bias in machine learning models, particularly in the context of geospatial modeling and bagging techniques. It doesn't delve into specific preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines. 

However, based on general knowledge of machine learning preprocessing, here are some techniques used to address data bias:

* **Stratified Splitting:** This technique ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of target variable classes as the original dataset. This helps prevent bias towards majority classes during training.

* **Oversampling:** This involves duplicating instances of minority classes to balance the dataset and prevent underrepresentation.

* **Undersampling:** This involves removing instances from the majority class to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse Data Collection:**  This involves actively seeking out and including data from a wide range of sources and representing different demographics, viewpoints, and backgrounds. This helps mitigate bias introduced by skewed or incomplete data. 


Keep in mind that the specific techniques used will depend on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed.
