The provided text focuses on the challenges of data drift in deep learning, particularly in long-term biomonitoring, and doesn't delve into the specifics of data splitting criteria for training, testing, and validation sets. 

To answer your query, here's a general explanation:

Data splitting for deep learning models typically involves partitioning the available dataset into three main subsets:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Test set:** This set is held out entirely from the training process and is used only once at the end to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

The exact proportions of each split can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the specific task. A common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. 

The key is to ensure that the splits are representative of the overall data distribution to obtain reliable performance estimates.
