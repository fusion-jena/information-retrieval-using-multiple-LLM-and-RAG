The provided text does not explicitly state the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  

It mentions the following:

* **Dataset:** A salmon scale image dataset with 9056 images was used for training.  
* **Expert Reading:** An additional 150 images were expert-read for comparison.
* **CNN Architecture:** An EfficientNet-B4 architecture was employed.
* **Training Data Split:** The text doesn't specify how the data was split into training, validation, and test sets.

**Missing Information:**

To determine the generalizability of the model, we need information about:

* **Data Diversity:**  Was the dataset representative of different salmon species, ages, environments, and scale conditions?
* **Cross-Validation:** Was cross-validation used to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data?
* **Stratified Splitting:** Was the data split stratified to ensure that the distribution of classes (e.g., farmed/wild, spawned/not spawned) was maintained in the training and validation sets?


Without this information, we cannot definitively assess the generalizability of the deep learning model.
