The text states that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the termination condition for the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm.  This means that the model performance was monitored by tracking the RMSE value during the training process.  The RFE algorithm iteratively removed variables and evaluated the impact on the RMSE.  Variables were retained only if their removal led to a worsening of the RMSE.
