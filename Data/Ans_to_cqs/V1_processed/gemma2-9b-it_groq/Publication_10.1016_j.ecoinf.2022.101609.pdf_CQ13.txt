The text mentions that the authors experimented with several optimizers such as SGD, RMSProp, LAMB, LARS, and Adam.  It also states that they determined the appropriate learning rate by plotting the training loss against different learning rates. The optimal learning rate was found to be 10<sup>-4</sup>. 

However, the specific hyperparameters ultimately used for the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
