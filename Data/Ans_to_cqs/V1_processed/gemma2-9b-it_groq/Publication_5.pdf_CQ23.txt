The provided text describes the model development process and evaluation metrics but doesn't specify the techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  

It mentions using a subset of the data for parameter tuning and a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) to identify important features. However, it doesn't discuss data splitting strategies like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset for training.
