The provided text states that the performance of the trained deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Precision (P):**  The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of predictions made.
* **Recall (R):** The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual objects present in the image.
* **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's accuracy.
* **Mean Average Precision (mAP):**  A measure of accuracy that considers the ranking of predictions.
