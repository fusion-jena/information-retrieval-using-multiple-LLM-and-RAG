The provided text focuses on the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in LSTM models and doesn't list the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. 

While it mentions "key hyperparameters" like the "number of hidden layers," it doesn't specify others such as learning rate or optimizer.
