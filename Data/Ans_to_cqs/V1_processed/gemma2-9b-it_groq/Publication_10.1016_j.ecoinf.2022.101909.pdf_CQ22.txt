The provided text focuses on the Average Precision (AP) and the mAP (mean Average Precision) as metrics for evaluating the performance of a multi-class classification deep learning model. 

Specifically, it mentions:

* **Precision:**  Defined as TP / (TP + FP), where TP are True Positives and FP are False Positives.
* **Recall:** Defined as TP / (TP + FN), where FN are False Negatives.
* **F1-score:** A harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall).

The text also discusses the use of Precision-Recall (P-R) curves to visualize the trade-off between precision and recall at different threshold settings.  The area under the P-R curve is approximated by the Average Precision (AP).


The mAP is the average of the AP values obtained for each class in a multi-class classification problem.
