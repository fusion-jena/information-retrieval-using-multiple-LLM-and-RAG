The text mentions the use of stratified splitting for training data in classification tasks 2 and 3. This technique aims to ensure that the training data represents the distribution of classes (query groups) in the overall dataset.  

The text also states that the dataset was split into chunks of 300 tokens for web articles, retaining chunks containing query terms. This suggests an attempt to focus on relevant sections of the text for training.

However, the provided context does not mention other generalizability measures like:

* **Diverse dataset:** Information about the dataset's diversity (e.g., sources, topics, writing styles) is lacking.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe any cross-validation techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 


Therefore, while stratified splitting was employed, the extent to which other measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model cannot be determined from the given text.
