Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. 

However, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Satellite imagery:** The article by Neckel et al. (2023) mentions using Sentinel-3B SYN satellite images for air pollution analysis. This suggests satellite data could be a source of raw data.
* **Sensor networks:**  While not directly mentioned, sensor networks are commonly used for collecting real-time air quality data, which could be used in a deep learning pipeline.
* **Public datasets:** The context mentions Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor VCD products, which are publicly available. These datasets likely contain raw data used for training and evaluating deep learning models.


It's important to note that these are inferences based on the limited information provided. The actual methods used in the deep learning pipeline described in the Navares and Aznarte (2020) paper might involve other data sources or techniques.
