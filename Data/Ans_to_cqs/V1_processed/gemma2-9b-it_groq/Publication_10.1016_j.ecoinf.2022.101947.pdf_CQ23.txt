The provided text describes the process of determining the optimal size for training and test sets for a deep learning model used to estimate Amur tiger populations. 

It mentions a "holdback trial partitioning test" and iterating 10 times for each combination of test/training set sizes with randomly selected trails. This suggests a form of cross-validation, but it doesn't explicitly state whether stratified splitting was used to ensure representation of different tiger characteristics in each set.

The text also highlights the use of a captive Amur tiger dataset for validation. While this dataset is valuable, it doesn't explicitly mention the diversity of the dataset in terms of age, sex, or other relevant factors that could impact the model's generalizability to wild populations. 


Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer some validation techniques were used, but we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model beyond the captive tiger dataset.
