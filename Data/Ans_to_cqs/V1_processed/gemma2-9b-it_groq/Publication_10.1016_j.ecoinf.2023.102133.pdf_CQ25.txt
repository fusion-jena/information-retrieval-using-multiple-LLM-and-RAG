The provided text focuses on using machine learning models, particularly Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ETa).  

While it describes the model architectures and hyperparameters, it doesn't explicitly state the primary purpose of the deep learning model beyond ETa estimation. 

Therefore, based on the context, the purpose of the deep learning model is to **predict crop evapotranspiration (ETa)**.
