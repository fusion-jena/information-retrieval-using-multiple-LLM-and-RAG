The provided text focuses on hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning models and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance. Common techniques include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy. This might involve combining features, transforming them (e.g., taking logarithms), or encoding categorical variables.

* **One-Hot Encoding:**  Converting categorical variables into a numerical format that deep learning models can understand. Each category becomes a separate binary feature.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data points. This is particularly useful for image data.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
