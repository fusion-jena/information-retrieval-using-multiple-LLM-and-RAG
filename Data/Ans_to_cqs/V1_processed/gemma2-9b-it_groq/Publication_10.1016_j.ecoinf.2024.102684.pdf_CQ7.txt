The provided text states that the dataset was split into three subsets: training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%). 

This split was chosen to obtain an unbiased estimation of error and to allow for hyperparameter search.  

Data augmentation was applied only to the training data to avoid overlap with the validation and testing sets.
