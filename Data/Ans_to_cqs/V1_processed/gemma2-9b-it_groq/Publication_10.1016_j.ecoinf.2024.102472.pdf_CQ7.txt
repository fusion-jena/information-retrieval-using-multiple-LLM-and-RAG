The provided text focuses on the training process of a specific deep learning model (MLPNN) and doesn't explicitly detail the criteria for splitting data into train, test, and validation sets. 

However, general practices in deep learning commonly use the following:

* **Training Data:** The largest portion of the dataset, used to train the model's parameters.
* **Validation Data:** A subset used during training to monitor the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data). 
* **Test Data:** Held out entirely from training, used only once at the end to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance.

The exact split ratios (e.g., 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test) can vary depending on the dataset size and specific problem.
