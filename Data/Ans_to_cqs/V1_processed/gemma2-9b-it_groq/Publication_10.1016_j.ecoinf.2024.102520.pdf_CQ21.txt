Based on the provided text, I cannot determine the specific post-processing steps involved after model training. 

The text focuses on image acquisition and processing, mentions aspects like  "editing, Writing, Visualization, Validation, Software, Resources, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization," and includes some numerical data related to RMSE and kriging variance. However, it doesn't delve into details about post-training procedures such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are used to visualize which parts of the input data are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.) are used to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


To get information about the post-processing steps, you would need to consult a more detailed description of the model development process or the research paper/report associated with this text.
