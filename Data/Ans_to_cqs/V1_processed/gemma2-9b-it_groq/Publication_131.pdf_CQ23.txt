The text states that "80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20% as tests" and that "a balanced sampling was carried out for the test set".  This suggests they used a train-test split strategy.  

It also mentions "one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was selected for each type of anuran call" for the test set. This indicates an attempt at balanced representation within the test set. 


However, the text does not mention cross-validation or other techniques to ensure generalizability beyond the train-test split.
