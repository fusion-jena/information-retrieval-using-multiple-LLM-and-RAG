The provided text focuses on the MLPnn-MC modeling technique for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Selecting relevant features and transforming them into a suitable format for the model. This might involve creating new features, encoding categorical variables, or scaling numerical features.

* **Normalization/Standardization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **One-Hot Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into a binary format (vectors of 0s and 1s) that the model can understand.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
