The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of a specific deep learning model, and doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps involved. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of features to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical data into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is often necessary for deep learning models.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.


The specific preprocessing steps used depend on the nature of the data and the chosen model architecture.
