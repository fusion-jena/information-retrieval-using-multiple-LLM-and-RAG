The following data augmentation techniques were applied to the images:

1. **Horizontal Flipping:** Images were randomly flipped horizontally. 
2. **Contrast Scaling:** The contrast of each image channel was scaled by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2.
3. **Random Cropping:** Images were randomly cropped to a square with side lengths equal to the image height.
