The provided text describes an ensemble modeling approach using BIOMOD2 and various algorithms like MaxEnt, RF, and SVM, but it doesn't mention any deep learning models.  Therefore, it doesn't provide information about metrics used to evaluate deep learning models like accuracy, precision, or recall. 


The text does state that the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristic Curve (AUC) is used to assess the accuracy of the models.
