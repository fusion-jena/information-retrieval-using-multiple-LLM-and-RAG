The provided text does not specify the exact names of the datasets used for training the initial EfficientNet B0 model. It only mentions that the model was pre-trained for generic image classification. 

However, it does state that the model is fine-tuned on "training sets of differing sizes, from the unseen site," which implies that site-specific acoustic data is used for the fine-tuning process.
