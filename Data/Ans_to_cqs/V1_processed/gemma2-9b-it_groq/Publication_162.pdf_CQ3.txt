The text mentions bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. 

It states: "We then trained a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet) on the cropped bounding box images of the detected moths and achieved an average accuracy of 89.00% on an held-out test set." This indicates that bounding boxes were drawn around the moths in the images for training the classifier.

Later, it refers to "D-Mask R-CNN architecture" which is a model known for instance segmentation. Instance segmentation  is a more advanced technique that not only draws bounding boxes around objects but also segments each object instance individually, creating a pixel-level mask for each object.
