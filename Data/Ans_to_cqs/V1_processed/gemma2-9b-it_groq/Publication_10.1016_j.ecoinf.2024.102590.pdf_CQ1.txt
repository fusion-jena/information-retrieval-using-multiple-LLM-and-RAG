The provided text focuses on a supervised learning workflow for land use and land cover (LULC) analysis, specifically in Kruger National Park. It details how vegetation types were used to guide the placement of sampling plots for data collection. 

However, the text doesn't explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.  It does state that aerial images of KNP are taken every two years and will be used for future analysis with deep learning methods. 


Therefore, based on the context, we can infer that aerial imagery is likely a primary data source for this deep learning application.
