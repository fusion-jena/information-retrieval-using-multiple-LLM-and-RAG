The provided text focuses on the workings of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention:

* **"Insect recordings"**: This suggests audio data is involved.
* **"Acoustically recorded bird songs"**:  Further confirms audio data as a component. 


Therefore, we can infer that at least audio data is used in the pipeline. The text doesn't provide information about other potential data formats like images, video, or CSV.
