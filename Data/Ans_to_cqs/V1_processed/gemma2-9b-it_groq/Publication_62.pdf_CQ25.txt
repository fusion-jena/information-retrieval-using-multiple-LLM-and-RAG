Based on the provided text, the deep learning models described are used for **image classification**. 

The text states that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are "especially well suited to image classification".  It also mentions that the models were trained to distinguish between "unstained/stained" and "clubmoss/spikemoss". Both of these are classification tasks.
