The provided text focuses on a tree-growing algorithm and doesn't discuss deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness within them.  

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  A random seed is an initial value used by random number generators. By setting a specific seed, you can ensure that the same "random" numbers are generated each time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This method normalizes the activations of each layer in a neural network, which can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of random initialization.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This involves making slight modifications to your training data (e.g., rotating images, adding noise) to increase its size and diversity, reducing the impact of randomness in the data itself.
