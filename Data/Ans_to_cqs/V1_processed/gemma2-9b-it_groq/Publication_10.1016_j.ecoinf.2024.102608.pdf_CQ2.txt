The provided text focuses on using machine learning, particularly with satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8), to estimate water quality parameters. 

While it mentions neural networks (a type of deep learning), it doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

Based on the context, we can infer that the primary data format is likely **raster data**, which is how satellite imagery is typically stored.
