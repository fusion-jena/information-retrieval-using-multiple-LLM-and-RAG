The provided text describes data preprocessing steps specific to a convolutional neural network (CNN) used for wetland classification.  It mentions the following:

* **Splitting data into blocks:** The data is divided into larger blocks based on coordinates for cross-validation.
* **Creating smaller samples:** These larger blocks are further divided into 80x80 pixel samples.
* **Random selection:** Samples are randomly selected from the training set for model training.

The text doesn't explicitly mention general data preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
