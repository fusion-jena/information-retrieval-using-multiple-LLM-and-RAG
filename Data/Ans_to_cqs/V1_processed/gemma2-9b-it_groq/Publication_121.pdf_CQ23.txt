The provided text describes the model's architecture and training process but doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure its generalizability, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While the text states the dataset contained 1.4 million images from 1000 classes, it doesn't elaborate on the diversity within those classes or the representativeness of the dataset.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't mention any cross-validation techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  The text describes a 75:25 split for training and testing but doesn't specify if this split was stratified to maintain class proportions in both sets. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
