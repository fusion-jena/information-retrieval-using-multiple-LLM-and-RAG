The provided text does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. The text focuses on an ensemble model that combines predictions from ten different algorithms, including Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), Maximum Entropy (MAXENT), and Random Forest (RF). 

The text describes techniques used for this ensemble model, such as:

* **Replicated runs:** Three replicated runs were performed for each model.
* **Threshold selection:** Model runs with a TSS (True Skill Statistic) greater than 0.5 were selected.
* **Weight averaging:** Predictions from all ten models were averaged to create the final ensemble model.

However, there is no information about deep learning techniques, data splitting strategies (like cross-validation or stratified splitting), or other methods typically employed to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models.
