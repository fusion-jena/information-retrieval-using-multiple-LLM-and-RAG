The provided text describes the use of a 70/30 split of the labeled dataset for training and testing, with 50% of the training data further reserved for validation.  

This suggests a strategy of using the validation set to monitor model performance during training.  The authors likely evaluated the model's performance on the validation set at regular intervals during training and adjusted hyperparameters or the training process based on the validation performance.
