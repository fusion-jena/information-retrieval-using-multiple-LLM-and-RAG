The provided text focuses on various topics like deep learning frameworks, event-stream processing, and biological applications of machine learning. It doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can offer some general information about how randomness is managed in deep learning:

* **Random Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly. This prevents all neurons from starting with the same values, promoting diverse learning.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and introduces stochasticity into the network.
* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch, helping to stabilize training and reduce the impact of random variations in the data.
* **Random Data Shuffling:** Training data is typically shuffled randomly before each epoch to prevent the model from learning patterns specific to the original data order.
* **Reproducibility:**  To ensure reproducibility, deep learning practitioners often set a random seed value. This initializes random number generators in a deterministic way, leading to the same random numbers being generated across different runs.
