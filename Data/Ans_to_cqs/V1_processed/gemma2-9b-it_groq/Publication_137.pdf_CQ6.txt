The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning model for point cloud segmentation and doesn't delve into general preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

It does mention the following preprocessing steps related to their specific task:

* **Voxelization:** The point cloud data is converted into a 3D grid (voxels) for processing.
* **Data Splitting:** The data is split into training and test sets (3:7 ratio) using the hold-out method. 


The text doesn't discuss common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
