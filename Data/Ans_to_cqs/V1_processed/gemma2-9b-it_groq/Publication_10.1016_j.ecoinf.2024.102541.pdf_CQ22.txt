The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning model's performance:

* **AP (Average Precision):**  A measure of accuracy across various object classes.  It's calculated by integrating the precision-recall curve.  Specific variations include AP0.5:0.95 (calculated over an IoU range of 0.5 to 0.95) and AP0.5 (at a 50% IoU threshold).
* **mAP (Mean Average Precision):** The average of all AP values, providing a single metric to represent overall accuracy.
* **FPS (Frames Per Second):**  A measure of the model's speed, encompassing preprocessing, inference, and non-maximum suppression. It reflects the model's efficiency in real-time applications.
