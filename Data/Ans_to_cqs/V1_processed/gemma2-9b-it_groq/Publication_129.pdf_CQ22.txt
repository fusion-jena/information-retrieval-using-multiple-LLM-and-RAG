The text states that four basic classification metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Accuracy:**  Calculated as (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + FN + TN) * 100%
* **Precision:** Calculated as TP / (TP + FP)
* **Recall:** Calculated as TP / (TP + FN)
* **F1-score:** Calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) 


Where:

* TP = True Positives
* TN = True Negatives
* FP = False Positives
* FN = False Negatives
