The provided text focuses on drought assessment and prediction using deep learning, particularly a CNN-LSTM hybrid model. It doesn't delve into specific data bias mitigation techniques used during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection based on the given context.
