The provided text states that the study used "water quality and hydraulic and hydrological data" as input for the CNN model.  It also mentions that the "manifold features of the autoencoder" were used as input. 

While the exact format of these data is not specified, we can infer that they are likely numerical data.  Water quality, hydraulic, and hydrological data often involve measurements like temperature, pH, flow rate, and water levels, which can be represented as numerical values. 

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the data used in this deep learning pipeline is likely in a format like CSV (Comma Separated Values) or a similar structured numerical format.
