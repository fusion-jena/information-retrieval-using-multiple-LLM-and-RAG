The provided text describes the process of training a random forest model to classify land use types, including mangroves. It mentions post-classification processing involving manual visual interpretation to correct misclassifications between forest and mangroves. 

However, it doesn't detail other post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the areas of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of the classification by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we can't definitively say what other post-processing steps were used.
