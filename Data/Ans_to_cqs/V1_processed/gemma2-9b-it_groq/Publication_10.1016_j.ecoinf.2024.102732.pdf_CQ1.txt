The provided text focuses on a study utilizing machine learning for estimating aboveground biomass and doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention:

* **Field data:** This suggests that researchers likely collected data directly from the field, possibly through measurements of tree height, diameter, or biomass.
* **Remote sensing:** The text refers to using data from the ALOS2 satellite and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) which are derived from remote sensing.
* **SRTM DEM data:** This indicates the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) likely obtained from a publicly available source like the USGS EarthExplorer.

Therefore, we can infer that the study likely combined field measurements with remote sensing data and publicly available DEM data to build its dataset for training the deep learning model.
