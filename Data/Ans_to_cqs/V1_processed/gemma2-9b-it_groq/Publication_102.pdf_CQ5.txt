The text mentions two datasets:

* **Imagenet:** This is a large-scale dataset of labeled images used for training image classification models. Both Model-K and Model-2 are initialized with pre-trained weights based on Imagenet. 
* **The Aerial Elephant Dataset:** This dataset, introduced in [25], is specifically designed for aerial object detection and is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models.
