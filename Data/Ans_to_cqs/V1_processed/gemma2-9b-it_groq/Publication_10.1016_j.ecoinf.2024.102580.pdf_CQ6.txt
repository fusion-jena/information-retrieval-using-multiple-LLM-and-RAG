The text describes the following preprocessing steps for training deep learning models:

* **Image Resolution Reduction:** Images were reduced to 1000 Ã— 1333 resolution for both seagrass and turtle detection models.

* **Normalization:**  The three color channels of the images were normalized by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviations per channel. These means and standard deviations were based on the ImageNet dataset used in pre-training the ResNet-50 model.

* **Object Queries (DETR):** For the DETR model, the "object queries" parameter was set to 100, allowing for the detection of up to 100 turtles in an image. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps like data cleaning (removing noise or outliers) or scaling (adjusting feature ranges).
