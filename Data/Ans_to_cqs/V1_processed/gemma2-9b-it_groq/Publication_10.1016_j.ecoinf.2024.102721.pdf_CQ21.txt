The provided text focuses on the structure and training of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for ecological informatics applications. It details aspects like Bayesian optimization, probabilistic proxy models, and evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R2). 

However, it doesn't explicitly describe post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are visualizations that highlight the regions of input data most influential in the model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:** While the text mentions RMSE, MAE, and R2, it doesn't explain how these are calculated after training.
* **Confusion matrix:** This is a table used for evaluating classification models, showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what specific post-processing steps are involved after model training.
