The text mentions the use of five training datasets created by the authors. These datasets were built using images with different levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and included an auxiliary class "Non-Forest".  

The text also states that image data was sourced from Google, Maxar, and the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset. 

However, it does not specify the names of any standard benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
