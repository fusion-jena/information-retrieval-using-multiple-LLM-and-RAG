The provided text focuses on the 3DUNetGSFormer model for wetland mapping and its use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Swin Transformers. It doesn't explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common practice in deep learning to address randomness through techniques like:

* **Setting a random seed:** This ensures that the random numbers generated during training (e.g., for weight initialization, data shuffling) are the same each time the code is run. This allows for reproducibility of results.

* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the network's learning process.

* **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each layer, helping to stabilize training and reduce the impact of random initialization.


Without more information about the specific implementation of the 3DUNetGSFormer model, it's impossible to say for sure which of these strategies (or others) are used.
