The provided text focuses on the data sources used in a specific research project related to land use and land cover analysis in Israel.  It doesn't delve into the methods used for collecting raw data in a general deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on the information given, we can infer some potential data collection methods used in this project:

* **Archaeological Surveys:** Conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), these likely involve manual documentation and recording of archaeological sites.
* **Remote Sensing:** This includes:
    * **Spaceborne VENÎ¼S:** A satellite-based system for monitoring vegetation and environment.
    * **Airborne LiDAR:**  Uses laser pulses to create detailed 3D maps of the Earth's surface.
    * **UAV (Drone) Imagery:**  Drones equipped with cameras capture high-resolution aerial photographs.
* **Digital Maps:** Obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for modern land use/land cover mapping.
* **Georegistered Orthophotos:** High-resolution aerial photographs from the Survey of Israel (SOI) used for georeferencing and masking the study area.

It's important to note that these methods are specific to the project described and may not represent the full range of data collection techniques used in all deep learning pipelines.
