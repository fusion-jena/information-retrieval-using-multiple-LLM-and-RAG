The provided text describes a study using deep learning for wildlife counting but doesn't detail the specific preprocessing steps taken for the images before training the model.  

It does mention:

* **Tiling:** Images were divided into 864x864 subimages.
* **Object Detection:** A YOLO DCNN with pretrained weights was used to identify potential objects in each subimage.
* **Filtering:**  Object detections that didn't correspond to Zooniverse data identifications were discarded. 

However, common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are not explicitly mentioned.
