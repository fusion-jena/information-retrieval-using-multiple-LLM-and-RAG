The provided text focuses on the specifics of a deep learning model for assessing soil salinity and doesn't delve into general strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention the use of a  "random seed value" which is a common technique to introduce controlled randomness. 

Here's how random seeds work in deep learning:

* **Reproducibility:**  Setting a random seed ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated every time you run your code. This is crucial for reproducibility, allowing you to get consistent results and debug your models effectively.

* **Initialization:** Random seeds are often used to initialize the weights of your neural network. Different weight initializations can lead to different model behaviors, so using a seed helps you compare different experiments or training runs fairly.

* **Data Shuffling:**  During training, data is often shuffled randomly before each epoch.  A random seed can control this shuffling, ensuring the same order of data is used across multiple runs.

**Other Strategies:**

Beyond random seeds, other strategies for managing randomness in deep learning include:

* **Dropout:** A regularization technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the network's structure.
* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of neurons within each batch, reducing the impact of internal covariate shift and improving training stability.
