The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline.  

To address your question about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning (like using random seed values), here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  A random seed is a starting value for the random number generator. By setting a fixed seed, you ensure that the same "random" numbers are generated each time you run your code. This makes your results reproducible.

* **Data Shuffling:**  Before training, data is often shuffled randomly. This helps prevent the model from learning patterns that are specific to the order of the data.

* **Dropout:**  Dropout is a regularization technique where a percentage of neurons are randomly "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  Batch normalization randomizes the input to each layer within a mini-batch of data. This helps stabilize training and can improve generalization.
