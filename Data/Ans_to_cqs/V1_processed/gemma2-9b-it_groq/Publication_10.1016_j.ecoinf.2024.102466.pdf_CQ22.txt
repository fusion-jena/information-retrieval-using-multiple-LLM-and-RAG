The provided text focuses on the performance of different object detection models on a specific dataset and mentions "mAP" as the metric used to evaluate their performance.  

mAP stands for mean Average Precision. It's a common metric for evaluating object detection models, providing an overall measure of accuracy by averaging the precision across different recall levels. 


While the text doesn't explicitly list other metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall, it's likely they are considered as part of the evaluation process, given the standard practice in the field of computer vision.
