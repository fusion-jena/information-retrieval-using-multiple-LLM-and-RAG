The provided text focuses on the model training process and results, particularly the accuracy of the model in predicting the presence or absence of Hyphantria cunea.  

It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:** These are used to visualize which input features are most influential in the model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  While the text mentions accuracy, it doesn't specify other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC that are commonly calculated after model training.
* **Confusion matrix:** This is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what post-processing steps were involved.
