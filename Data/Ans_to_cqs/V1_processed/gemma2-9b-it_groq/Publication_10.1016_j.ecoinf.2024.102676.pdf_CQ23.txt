The provided text does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

While the text mentions using a diverse dataset of footprints from different species (Amur tiger, cheetah, giant panda, mountain lion), it doesn't elaborate on the dataset's size, distribution, or how it was curated for representativeness. 

The text also doesn't describe techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to assess and improve a model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
