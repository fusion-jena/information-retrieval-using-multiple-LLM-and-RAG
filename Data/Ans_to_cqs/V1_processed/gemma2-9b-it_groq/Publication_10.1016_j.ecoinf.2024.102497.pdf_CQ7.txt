The provided text focuses on the CART and Random Forest regression algorithms and doesn't offer information about data splitting criteria for deep learning models. 

Generally, in deep learning, data is split into three sets:

* **Training set:** This is the largest portion of the data used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this dataset.
* **Validation set:** This set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Test set:** This set is held out entirely from the training process and is used only once at the end to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance. 


The typical split ratios are 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, these ratios can be adjusted depending on the size and complexity of the dataset.
