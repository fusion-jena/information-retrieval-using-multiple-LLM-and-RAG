Based on the provided text snippets, the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes **image** data. 

Several references mention:

* **Hyperspectral image classification:** This suggests the use of multi-spectral image data with a high number of bands.
* **Multispectral and SAR data:**  SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data is a type of remote sensing image data.
* **Landsat 8 multispectral sensor:**  Landsat 8 is a satellite that captures multispectral images.
* **Sentinel-2 spectral data:** Sentinel-2 is another satellite that provides multispectral imagery.
* **PolSAR image classification:** PolSAR (Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar) is a type of SAR data that involves analyzing the polarization of radar signals reflected from the Earth's surface.

While the text focuses on image data, it's possible that other data formats like **CSV** (Comma Separated Values) are used for storing ancillary information related to the images, such as geographical coordinates or ground truth labels.
