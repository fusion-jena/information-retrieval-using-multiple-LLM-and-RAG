The provided text does not specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It mentions the use of validation data and a grid search method for hyperparameter tuning, which are common practices to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset were employed.
