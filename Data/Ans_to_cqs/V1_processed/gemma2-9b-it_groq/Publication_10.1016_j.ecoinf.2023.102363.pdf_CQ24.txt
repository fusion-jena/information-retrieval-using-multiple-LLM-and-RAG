The provided text focuses on fine-tuning a deep learning model for acoustic classification and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention a few techniques that indirectly address randomness:

* **Cyclical Learning Rate:** This method adjusts the learning rate during training in a cyclical pattern, potentially mitigating the impact of random weight initialization on convergence.
* **Dropout:** This technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step, introducing noise and preventing overfitting to specific patterns in the data.
* **DropConnect:** Similar to dropout, DropConnect randomly drops connections between neurons, further increasing the model's robustness to variations in the input data.

To get a comprehensive answer about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning (e.g., random seed value), you'd need to consult resources dedicated to deep learning best practices and hyperparameter tuning.
