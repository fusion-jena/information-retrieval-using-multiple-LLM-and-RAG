The provided text focuses on transfer learning techniques and doesn't explicitly state the purpose of a specific deep learning model. 

However, it does mention several applications of deep learning, including:

* **Land use classification:** This suggests a classification task where the model categorizes land into different types.
* **Driver drowsiness estimation:** This implies a detection task where the model identifies drowsy drivers.
* **Spam filtering:** This is another classification task, aiming to distinguish spam emails from legitimate ones.
* **Texture image segmentation:** This points towards a segmentation task, dividing an image into regions based on texture.
* **Acoustic data analysis for sow oestrus detection:** This involves classification, identifying oestrus (heat) sounds in sows.


Therefore, based on the context, deep learning models in this text are used for **classification, detection, and potentially segmentation tasks**.
