The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of machine learning models, not deep learning models specifically.  

It mentions the following metrics for evaluating model performance:

* **R2 (Coefficient of Determination):**  Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. 
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**  Calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and observed values.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**  Calculates the square root of the average squared difference between predicted and observed values. 


The text does not discuss accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics.
