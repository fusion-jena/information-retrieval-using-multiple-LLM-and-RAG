The provided text focuses on the performance of different deep learning architectures (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, DenseNet-201) and doesn't delve into specific data bias mitigation techniques used during preprocessing. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection based on the given context.
