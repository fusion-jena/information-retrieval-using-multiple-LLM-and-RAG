The provided text focuses on machine learning algorithms, particularly LightGBM, and their application in forest canopy cover prediction using satellite imagery. It doesn't discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.  

To answer your query about data collection methods in deep learning, here are some common examples:

* **Surveys:**  Structured questionnaires or interviews can gather labeled data for tasks like image classification or sentiment analysis.
* **Sensors:**  Various types of sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar, GPS) collect raw data about the physical world, which can be used for object detection, autonomous navigation, or environmental monitoring.
* **Public Datasets:**  Many organizations and research groups make large datasets publicly available for use in deep learning research and development. These datasets cover a wide range of domains, including images, text, audio, and sensor data.
