The provided text describes the training process and the dataset used, but it doesn't detail specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix generation. 

It does mention:

* **Five-fold cross-validation:** This technique is used to evaluate the model's performance by splitting the data into five parts, training on four and testing on one, and repeating the process five times.
* **Training and validation loss/accuracy:** These metrics are tracked during training to monitor the model's performance on the training and validation sets.
* **Test confusion matrix:** A confusion matrix is generated for the test data, showing the model's performance for each sound class. 
* **Average unweighted and category-weighted accuracies:** These are reported for both training and test datasets.
* **F1-scores:**  These are calculated for both training and testing datasets. 


It's unclear from the text whether saliency maps or other specific post-processing techniques were used.
