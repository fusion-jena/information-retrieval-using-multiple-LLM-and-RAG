The provided text describes the dataset used to train the deep learning model and the model's performance. However, it doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:** While the text mentions using data from multiple sources (Google, Maxar, and NWPU-RESISC45), it doesn't elaborate on the diversity of the dataset in terms of geographical location, tree species, or other relevant factors.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't mention any cross-validation techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling to maintain the class distribution. 


Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
