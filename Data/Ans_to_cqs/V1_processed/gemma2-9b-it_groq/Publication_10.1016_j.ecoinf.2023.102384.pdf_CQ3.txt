Based on the provided text, the following data annotation techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline:

* **Bounding box annotation:**  This technique is used to generate ground truth data for training models. As described in Figure 3, bounding boxes are created as squares centered over dot labels, with a fixed side length.

* **Density map annotation:**  Gaussian kernels are overlaid on dot positions to create density maps, which represent the probability of an object's presence at each location.

* **Instance segmentation:**  Discs centered at dot positions are superimposed to create instance segmentation masks. Overlapping discs are split using a background ridge.
