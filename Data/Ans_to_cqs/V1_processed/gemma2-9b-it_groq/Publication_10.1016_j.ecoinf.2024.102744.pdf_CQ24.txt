The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning model for pollen-bearing bee detection and doesn't delve into general strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can tell you that randomness is often introduced in deep learning through:

* **Random Initialization:** Weights of the neural network are randomly initialized.
* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training to prevent overfitting.
* **Data Augmentation:** Randomly applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to training data to increase its diversity.
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Uses a random subset of the training data (mini-batch) to calculate the gradient at each step.

To mitigate the impact of randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners often:

* **Set a Fixed Random Seed:** This ensures that the random number generator starts from the same point, leading to the same random initialization and data shuffling.
* **Use Techniques Like K-Fold Cross-Validation:** This involves splitting the data into k folds and training/evaluating the model on different combinations of these folds, reducing the impact of random data splits.
