The provided text focuses on the validation of a permafrost model called PermaBN and doesn't contain information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

To answer your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning models, here are some common ones:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance. Common methods include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical data (e.g., colors, categories) into numerical representations that the model can understand is often necessary. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are used.
* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance and preventing overfitting.
