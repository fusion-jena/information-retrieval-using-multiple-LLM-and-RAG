The provided text doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance during training.  It mentions that all pre-trained models converged training after 1000 epochs and used SGDM as the optimization algorithm. 

However, it doesn't describe specific metrics used to track performance (e.g., accuracy, loss) or any techniques for early stopping or validation.
