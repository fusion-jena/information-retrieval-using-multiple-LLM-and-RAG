The provided text focuses on the architecture and training of a deep learning model for insect classification, and it doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention the use of **dropout regularization** during training. Dropout is a technique that randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This helps prevent overfitting by introducing randomness and forcing the network to learn more robust features.

The text also states that the **Adam optimizer** was chosen over stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and provides specific hyperparameters for Adam.  The choice of optimizer and its hyperparameters can influence the randomness inherent in the training process.

To get a comprehensive answer about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, you'd need to consult additional resources on deep learning best practices and techniques.
