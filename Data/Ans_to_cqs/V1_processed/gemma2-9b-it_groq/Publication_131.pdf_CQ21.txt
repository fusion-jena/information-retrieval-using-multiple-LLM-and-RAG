The provided text describes the process of training a CNN for sound classification but doesn't detail the specific post-processing steps taken after training.  

It does mention:

* **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix is presented for the first CNN (5 classes), indicating its performance in classifying different sound patterns.

The text also alludes to other common post-processing techniques:

* **Metrics Calculation:**  The text states that the network's performance is evaluated, implying the calculation of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Saliency Maps:** While not explicitly mentioned, saliency maps are a common post-processing technique used with CNNs to visualize which parts of the input (in this case, the mel-spectrogram) are most influential in the model's decision. 


However, the text doesn't provide details on how these metrics are calculated or how saliency maps are generated in this specific case.
