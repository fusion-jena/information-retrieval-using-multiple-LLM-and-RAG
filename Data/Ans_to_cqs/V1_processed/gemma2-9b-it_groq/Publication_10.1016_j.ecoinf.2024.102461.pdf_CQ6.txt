The provided text focuses on fire risk mapping using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization/Scaling:**  Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve the performance and stability of deep learning models.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:**  Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for deep learning models to process them.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) can help improve generalization. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
