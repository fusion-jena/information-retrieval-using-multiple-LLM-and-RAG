The text states that the classification performance of the EMViT-Net model is assessed using the following metrics:

* **Precision:**  The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made.
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** The ratio of correctly predicted positive samples to the total number of actual positive samples.
* **F1-score:** A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
* **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly predicted samples (both true positives and true negatives) to the total number of samples.
