The provided text states that LaDeco uses a computer with 128GB RAM, an Intel-i9 CPU, and a Nvidia-RTX5000 GPU for processing images.  It also mentions that more advanced GPUs can improve processing speed. 

While it doesn't explicitly say which hardware is used for *training* the deep learning model, it strongly implies that the Nvidia-RTX5000 GPU is involved in this process as well.
