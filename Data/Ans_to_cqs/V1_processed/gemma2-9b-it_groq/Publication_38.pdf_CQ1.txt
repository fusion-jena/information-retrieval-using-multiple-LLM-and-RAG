The provided text describes the use of acoustic devices (Tranquility Transect) set to record using a time-expanded (TE) factor of 10, a sampling time of 320ms, and maximum sensitivity.  These devices were used by citizen scientists as part of the Indicator Bats Programme (iBats) to record ultrasonic acoustic data along road-transects.  

Therefore, the method utilized for collecting raw data is **acoustic recording using specialized devices deployed by citizen scientists during surveys**.
