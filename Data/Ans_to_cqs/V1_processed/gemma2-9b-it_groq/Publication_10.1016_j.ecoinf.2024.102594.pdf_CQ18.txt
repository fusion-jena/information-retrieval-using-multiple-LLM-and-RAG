The provided text describes a strategy for monitoring model performance during training using a ReduceLROnPlateau callback. 

This strategy works as follows:

1. **Validation Loss Tracking:** The model's performance is evaluated on a validation set after each epoch (training cycle). The validation loss, which measures the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels on the validation set, is tracked.

2. **Learning Rate Adjustment:** If the validation loss does not decrease for 5 consecutive epochs, the learning rate is halved. This helps prevent the model from getting stuck in a local minimum and encourages further learning.

3. **Training Termination:** If there is no decrease in the validation loss after 10 consecutive epochs, the training process is terminated. This indicates that the model has likely stopped improving and further training is unlikely to be beneficial.
