The text states that the ResNet50 model's performance is evaluated using **top1 accuracy** and **top5 accuracy**. 

* **Top1 accuracy** measures how often the correct label is the highest probability label predicted by the model. 
* **Top5 accuracy** measures how often the correct label is among the five labels with the highest probabilities.
