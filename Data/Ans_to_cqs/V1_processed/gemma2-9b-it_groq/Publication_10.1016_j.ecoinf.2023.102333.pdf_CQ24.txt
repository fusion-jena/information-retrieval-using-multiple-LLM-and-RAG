The provided text focuses on hyperparameter optimization techniques like Random Search and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the broader deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention dropout as a regularization technique that introduces randomness during training. Dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons in each layer during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features that are not reliant on any single neuron.

To address randomness in other aspects of the deep learning pipeline, common strategies include:

* **Setting a random seed:**  Initializing the random number generator with a specific seed ensures that the same "random" values are generated every time you run your code. This allows for reproducibility of results.

* **Data shuffling:** Randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch prevents the model from learning patterns based on the order of data points.

* **Batch normalization:** This technique introduces randomness during training by normalizing the activations of each layer. This helps stabilize training and can improve generalization.
