The provided text does not describe a deep learning model. It discusses  random forest models, which are ensemble learning methods, and Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) logistic regression models.  

Therefore, I cannot answer what the purpose of a deep learning model is based on this text.
