The provided text describes the use of bounding box annotation for object detection. 

It states that the datasets were labelled using 'LabelImg' software under expert guidance. 'LabelImg' is a graphical image annotation tool written in Python, and the labelled files were saved in PASCAL VOC format as .xml files.  

The text focuses on the conversion of the labelled data from PASCAL VOC format to TensorFlow's 'TFRecords' file format for efficient processing within the deep learning pipeline. 


It does not mention other data annotation techniques like instance segmentation.
