The provided text describes the data preparation and model training process but doesn't explicitly mention the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does state that a validation set was created (100 ROIs per species) to evaluate the model's performance during the fine-tuning process. This suggests that the model's performance was assessed on this validation set at regular intervals during training. 

However, the exact metrics used for evaluation and the frequency of performance checks are not detailed in the provided context.
