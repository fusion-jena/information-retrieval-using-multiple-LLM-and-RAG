Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated. 

However, the text mentions "CNN deep learning model" in the context of sentimental short sentences classification (Sharma et al., 2020).  It also discusses "embedding layers" which are commonly used in various deep learning architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. 


Without further information from the complete text, it's impossible to definitively determine the precise deep learning model employed.
