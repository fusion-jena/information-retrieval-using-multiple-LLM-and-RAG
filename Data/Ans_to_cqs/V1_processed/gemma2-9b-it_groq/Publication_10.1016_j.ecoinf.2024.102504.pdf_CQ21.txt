The provided text focuses on research papers related to air quality and doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps used after model training. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context. 


Common post-processing steps after model training include:

* **Metrics Calculation:** Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
* **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizing the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
* **Saliency Maps:**  Highlighting the input features that contribute most to the model's prediction, providing insights into feature importance.
* **Threshold Tuning:**  Finding the optimal threshold for classifying predictions, balancing true positive and false positive rates.
* **Data Visualization:**  Creating plots and charts to understand model behavior and identify potential biases or areas for improvement.
