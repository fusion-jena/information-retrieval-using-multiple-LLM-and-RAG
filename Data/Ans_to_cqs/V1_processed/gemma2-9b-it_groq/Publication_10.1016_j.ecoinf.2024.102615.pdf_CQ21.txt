The provided text focuses on the model training and optimization process, specifically detailing the architecture selection and hyperparameter tuning for a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model.  

It doesn't describe any post-processing steps performed after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which input features are most influential in the model's predictions.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  Displaying the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives to analyze classification performance. 


Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved.
