Based on the provided context, the deep learning models discussed are primarily used for **object detection**. 

Several mentions highlight this purpose:

*  The text discusses the limitations of conventional object detection methods and the need for multiscale feature extraction networks (MSNet) to address them.
*  The comparison of YOLOv7 with other models like Mask R-CNN further emphasizes object detection as the primary application.
*  The description of YOLOv7's structure, including its input, backbone, and header network, points towards its role in detecting objects within an image.


The context focuses on improving object detection accuracy, especially in challenging scenarios like high dynamic density and limited training data.
