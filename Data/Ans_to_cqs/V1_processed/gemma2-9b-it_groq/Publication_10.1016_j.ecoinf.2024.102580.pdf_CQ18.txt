The text describes several strategies used to monitor the model's performance during training:

* **Training and Validation Loss Curves:** The model's overall training loss and validation loss are tracked over time. This helps identify if the model is learning effectively and if it's starting to overfit (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).

* **Mean Average Precision (mAP) Curve:** The mAP curve for the validation set is plotted to evaluate the model's ability to accurately detect turtles.  

* **Generalized Intersection-over-Union (IoU) Loss Curve:** The IoU loss curve, also for training and validation sets, is used to measure the overlap between the model's predicted bounding boxes and the ground truth bounding boxes.

* **Precision and Recall:** Precision and recall are plotted against different confidence thresholds on the validation set. This helps determine the optimal confidence threshold that balances the model's ability to detect turtles (precision) while minimizing false detections (recall).
