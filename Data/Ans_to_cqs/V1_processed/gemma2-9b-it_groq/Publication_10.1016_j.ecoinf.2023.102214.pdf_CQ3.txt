The provided text states that annotations were created using a computer vision model based on machine learning. These annotations were then coupled with the human identification of known individuals.  

The text specifically mentions "machine learning-detected bounding boxes around snow leopards in photos" as annotations. 

Therefore, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is **bounding box annotation**.
