Based on the provided text, the deep learning framework used is **TensorFlow**. 

This is evident from the following lines:

*  `tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16(weights=’imagenet’).`
*  `tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet_v2.ResNet152V2(weights=’imagenet’).` 

These lines indicate the use of  `tensorflow.keras`  which is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models in TensorFlow.
