The provided text does not specify the exact optimization method used for the LTR model's hyperparameters (e.g., grid search, random search). 

It only mentions that the authors, Runge et al. (2022), optimized the LTR model parameters and that two parameters, Max Segments (MS) and Recovery Threshold (RT), were found to be particularly critical for performance.
