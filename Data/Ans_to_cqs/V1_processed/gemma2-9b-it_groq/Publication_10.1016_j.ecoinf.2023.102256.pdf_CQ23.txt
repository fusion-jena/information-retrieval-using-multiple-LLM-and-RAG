The provided text doesn't explicitly state the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It mentions:

* **Ten independent executions:** This suggests some form of cross-validation was likely used, but the exact method isn't detailed.
* **Small dataset:** The text acknowledges the dataset size is relatively small, which can be a challenge for generalizability.

However,  information about data diversity, stratified splitting, or other techniques to enhance generalizability is absent from the provided context.
