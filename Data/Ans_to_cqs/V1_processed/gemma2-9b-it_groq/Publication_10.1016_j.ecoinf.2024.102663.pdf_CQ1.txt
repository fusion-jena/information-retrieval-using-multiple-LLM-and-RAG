The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for fish biomass estimation and doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting raw data. 

However, it does mention:

* **Underwater videos:** These are suggested as a source of data for detecting fish and estimating their size, which can then be used to calculate biomass. 

It's reasonable to infer that other potential data sources could include:

* **Surveys:**  Researchers might conduct underwater surveys to manually count and measure fish populations.
* **Sensors:**  Sensors deployed in aquatic environments could collect data on fish movement, density, and other relevant parameters.
* **Public datasets:**  Existing public datasets containing fish images or other relevant information could be utilized. 


The specific methods used for data collection would likely depend on the research objectives, the target fish species, and the environmental conditions.
