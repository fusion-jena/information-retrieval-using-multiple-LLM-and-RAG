The provided text states that the data is split into training and validation sets.  It says:

"Eventually, we store these images in two distinct directories named train and valid."

and

" # validation dataset
pix_valid <- labels %>%
group_by(Keywords) %>%
filter(between(row_number(), floor(n()*80/100) + 1, n()))"

This indicates that 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for validation.
