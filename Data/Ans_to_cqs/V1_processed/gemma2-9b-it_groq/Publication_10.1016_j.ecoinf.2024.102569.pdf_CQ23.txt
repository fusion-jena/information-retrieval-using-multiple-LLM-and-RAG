The provided text focuses on the methodology used to address the issue of heterogeneous observations in a deep learning model, particularly the use of the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) and its role in selecting tuning parameters. 

It does not, however, provide information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
