The provided text describes the optimization of the random forest (RF) model's hyperparameters, specifically focusing on the  "number of variables to try (M)". 

It states that the optimal value for M was determined using the internal RF function "TuneRF". This function calculates the minimum out-of-bag (OOB) error rate both below and above a threshold value (one-third of the total number of variables). 

The text doesn't explicitly mention other hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search. Therefore, based on the information given, we can conclude that "TuneRF" was used to optimize the "M" hyperparameter in this specific case.
