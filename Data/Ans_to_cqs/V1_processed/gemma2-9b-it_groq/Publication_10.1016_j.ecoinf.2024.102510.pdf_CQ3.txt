The provided text mentions the use of bounding boxes and part annotations for bird species classification. 

Specifically, it states: "Other studies followed the Fine-Grained Image Classification (FGIC) methods (Wang et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2018) and have used the Mask Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) (Wei et al., 2018) and attention guided data augmentation (Wang et al., 2023) to categorize the birds at a detailed level using bounding boxes and part annotations and achieved 85â€“87% accuracy."


Therefore, the data annotation techniques used in this deep learning pipeline include:

* **Bounding box annotation:**  Used to define the region of interest (the bird) within an image.
* **Part annotation:**  Likely involves labeling specific parts of the bird within the bounding box (e.g., beak, wings, tail). 


The text also mentions "Mask Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN)," which suggests the use of instance segmentation, a technique that goes beyond bounding boxes to identify and segment individual instances of objects (birds in this case) within an image.
