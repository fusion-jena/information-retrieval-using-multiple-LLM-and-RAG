The provided text focuses on marine ecology research and doesn't delve into deep learning preprocessing techniques or data bias mitigation strategies.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your query using the given context. 

To learn about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection for addressing data bias in deep learning, I recommend exploring resources on machine learning preprocessing and bias mitigation.
