The text states that the deep learning CNN's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Error rate:**  This is the percentage of incorrect classifications. The initial model had an error rate of 11.95%, which was reduced to 5.2% after fine-tuning.
* **Accuracy:** This is the percentage of correct classifications. The fine-tuned model achieved an accuracy of 94.8%.
* **Training loss:** This measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values during training. The training loss decreased from 0.3462 to 0.1397 after fine-tuning.
* **Validation loss:** This measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values on a separate validation dataset. The validation loss also decreased from 0.2847 to 0.1446 after fine-tuning.
