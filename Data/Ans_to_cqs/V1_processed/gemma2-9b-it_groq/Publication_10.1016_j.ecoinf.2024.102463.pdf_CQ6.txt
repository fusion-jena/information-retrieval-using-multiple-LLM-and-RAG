The provided text focuses on hyperparameter optimization techniques and doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, it does mention that data is standardized during training. Standardization is a common preprocessing technique that involves scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance. This can improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models. 

Other common preprocessing steps include:

* **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a specific range, such as between 0 and 1.
* **Encoding categorical variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations that can be understood by the model.
