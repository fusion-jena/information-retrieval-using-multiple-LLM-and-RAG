The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in image processing, particularly using convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). While it mentions the training process and optimization algorithms, it doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
