The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning application (plant leaf classification) and details the CNN architecture, hyperparameter optimization, and dataset augmentation techniques used.  

While it mentions data augmentation techniques like random rotation, cropping, flipping, and noise addition, it doesn't explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the broader deep learning pipeline, such as using a random seed value for reproducibility.
