The deep learning model is used for **tree detection**.  

The text states: "Tree crown detection is a fundamental task in remote sensing for forestry and ecosystem ecology. Using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, we extend a recently developed deep learning approach to include data from a range of forest types to determine whether information from one forest can be used for tree detection in other forests, and explore the potential for building a universal tree detection algorithm."
