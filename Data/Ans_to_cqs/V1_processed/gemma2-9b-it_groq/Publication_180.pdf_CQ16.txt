The text states that the researchers considered two factors to determine the optimal number of training steps:

1. **Correct identification rate:** This rate was monitored and increased up to a point, after which it plateaued.  

2. **Processing time:** This increased linearly with the number of training steps.

The researchers aimed to find the point where the identification rate stopped improving significantly while keeping processing time reasonable.  For the Mexican dataset, 2,000 training steps were found to be optimal, balancing these two factors.
