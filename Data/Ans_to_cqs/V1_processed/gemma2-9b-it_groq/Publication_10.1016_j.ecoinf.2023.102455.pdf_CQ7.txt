The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation. 

It's common practice in deep learning to split data into these sets:

* **Training Set:** Used to train the model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data. This is typically the largest portion of the dataset.
* **Validation Set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
* **Testing Set:** Used only once at the end of the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance on unseen data.

The specific split ratios (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing) can vary depending on the dataset size and the problem being addressed.
