The provided text describes a deep learning pipeline for processing point cloud data.  It mentions that point clouds are converted into 2D images for processing by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

Therefore, the data formats used in this pipeline are:

* **Point cloud:** The original input data.
* **2D images:**  Representations of point clouds created for CNN processing.
