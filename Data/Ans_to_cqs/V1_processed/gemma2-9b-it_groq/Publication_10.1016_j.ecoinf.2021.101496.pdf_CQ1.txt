The provided text focuses on the use of optical methods and sensors for collecting data on plant chlorophyll content and growth.  It mentions:

* **Google Glass:** Used for quantifying plant chlorophyll content (Cortazar et al., 2015).
* **Remote sensing methods:** Employed for predicting winter oilseed rape and winter wheat growth (Dom√≠nguez et al., 2016).
* **SPAD-502Plus:** A handheld chlorophyll meter used to measure leaf chlorophyll content.

The text also discusses the use of thermal-RGB imaging systems for monitoring agricultural crops (Osroosh et al., 2018).

While the text doesn't explicitly mention "deep learning pipelines," it highlights the use of sensors and optical methods for data collection, which are common in such pipelines.
