The text states that all deep learning models used were implemented using TensorFlow and that the architectures evaluated include FCN, U-Net, SegNet, and DeepLabv3+.  

Given that these are all architectures commonly used for image segmentation, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
