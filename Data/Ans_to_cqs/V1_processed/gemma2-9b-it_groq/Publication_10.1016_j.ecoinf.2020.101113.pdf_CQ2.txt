The provided text describes the use of spectrograms as input for the CNN model. Spectrograms are visual representations of sound, essentially turning audio data into images. 

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline uses **audio data** as the source, which is then transformed into **spectrogram images** for processing by the CNN.
