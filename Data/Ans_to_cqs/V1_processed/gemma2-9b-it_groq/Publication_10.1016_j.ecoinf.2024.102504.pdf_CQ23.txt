The provided text snippets do not contain information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in the context of air quality prediction. 

While some papers mention using machine learning models like LSTM and MLP for air quality prediction, they don't delve into the details of data preprocessing, model training techniques, or validation strategies used to ensure the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
