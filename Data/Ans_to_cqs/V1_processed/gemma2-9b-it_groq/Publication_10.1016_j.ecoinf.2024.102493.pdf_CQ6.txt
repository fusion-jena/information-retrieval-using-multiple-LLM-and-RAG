While the provided text focuses on processing NDVI data for ecological analysis, it doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps specific to training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is often necessary for deep learning algorithms.
* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance.


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of your data and the deep learning model you are using.
