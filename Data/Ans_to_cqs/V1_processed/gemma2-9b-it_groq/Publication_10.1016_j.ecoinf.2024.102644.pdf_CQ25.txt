The provided text describes a machine learning model, not a deep learning model, and focuses on predicting the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution. 

The model uses MaxEnt, a machine learning algorithm, to create ecological niche models for 180 species. These models predict the suitable habitat for each species based on environmental factors and species occurrence data. 

The overall purpose of the model is to understand how climate change will impact biodiversity in a specific wetland basin.
