The provided text focuses on the challenges of using data from low-cost Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in deep learning and introduces matrix factorization and deep matrix factorization as techniques to handle data sparsity. 

It does not discuss techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
