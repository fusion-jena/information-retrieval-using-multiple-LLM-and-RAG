The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  against the BIOCLIM model for species distribution modeling. It doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

To answer your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning (like random seed values), here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  You can initialize the random number generator with a specific seed value. This ensures that the same "random" values are generated every time you run your code, making your results reproducible.

* **Weight Initialization:**  Different methods exist for initializing the weights of neural networks, some of which introduce randomness. Techniques like Xavier or He initialization aim to provide better starting points for learning.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training. This prevents overfitting and introduces some randomness into the network's structure.
* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training. It helps stabilize training and can reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.
