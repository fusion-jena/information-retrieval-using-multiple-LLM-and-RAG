The text mentions a few techniques used to improve the model's generalizability:

* **Data Augmentation:**  The authors used "aggressive data augmentation" which included random horizontal flipping to address variations in illumination and angles present in the original images. 
* **Five-fold Subject-Exclusive Cross-Validation:** This technique, also known as SE cross-validation, ensures that no individual panda appears in both the training and testing sets simultaneously. This helps prevent overfitting to specific individuals and promotes a more robust model.
* **Pre-training on ImageNet:** The model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, a large-scale image dataset with diverse content. This pre-training provides the model with a foundational understanding of image features, potentially improving its ability to generalize to new data.
