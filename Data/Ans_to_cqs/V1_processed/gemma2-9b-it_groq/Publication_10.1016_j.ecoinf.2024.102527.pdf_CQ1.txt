The provided text describes the use of three datasets: ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM). 

* **ImageNet** is a benchmark dataset with manually annotated images of varying sizes. It's described as a "public dataset".
* **Snapshot Serengeti (SS)** and **Lasha Mountain (LSM)** are camera trap image datasets. Camera traps are sensors that automatically capture images when triggered by movement. 

Therefore, the methods used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline include:

* **Publicly available datasets:** ImageNet
* **Camera traps:** SS and LSM datasets.
