The provided text does not specify the exact optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.  While it mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), it doesn't delve into the details of the optimization algorithms employed to train these models. 


Possible optimization techniques commonly used with CNNs and LSTMs include:

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: A fundamental optimization algorithm that iteratively updates model weights based on the gradient of the loss function.

* **Adam**: A popular adaptive optimization algorithm that combines elements of SGD with momentum and adaptive learning rates.

* **RMSprop**: Another adaptive optimization algorithm that addresses the issue of vanishing gradients by maintaining a moving average of squared gradients. 


To determine the specific optimization techniques used in this study, you would need to refer to the original research paper (Kaur, A., Sood, S.K., 2020. Deep learning based drought assessment and prediction framework. Eco. Inform. 57.)
