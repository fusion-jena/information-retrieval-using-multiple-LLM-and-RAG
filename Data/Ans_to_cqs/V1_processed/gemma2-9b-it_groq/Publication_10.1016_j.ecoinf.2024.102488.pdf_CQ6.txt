The provided text focuses on a machine learning workflow using various algorithms (TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, etc.) and doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning model preprocessing. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) to ensure features have zero mean and unit variance.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations to existing data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to improve model robustness and generalization. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
