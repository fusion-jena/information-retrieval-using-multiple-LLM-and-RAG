The provided text focuses on the training process of a model for biocrust segmentation and doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps.  

While it mentions using metrics like accuracy and cross-validation during training, it doesn't detail post-training analyses like:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight regions of an input image that are most influential in the model's decision.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
* **Other metrics:** Depending on the task, additional metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or IoU (Intersection over Union) might be calculated. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide information about the precise post-processing steps employed after model training.
