The provided text focuses on water quality prediction using various machine learning algorithms and doesn't specify the exact data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. 

However, considering the context of  "Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)" and "Landsat satellites" being used for water quality estimation, it's highly likely that the deep learning pipeline utilizes **image data** derived from these satellite sensors.
