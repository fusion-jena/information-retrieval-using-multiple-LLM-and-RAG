The provided text describes the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained model for acoustic classification but doesn't specify the exact criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. 

We know the following:

* **Training data:**  The model is fine-tuned with randomly pooled training sets of increasing size (50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 frames) from Gulf of Mexico acoustic data collected on December 3rd, 2019, and an additional set of 500 frames of randomly sampled ambient noise.
* **Validation data:** The validation set combines the original base model's validation set with 100 frames per class from the labeled December 3rd, 2019 training set.

The text doesn't explicitly state the size or source of the test set. 


It's common practice to split data into these sets:

* **Training set:** Used to train the model.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** Used for a final evaluation of the trained model's performance on unseen data.
