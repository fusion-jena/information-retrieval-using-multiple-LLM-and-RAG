The provided text focuses on water quality index (WQI) prediction using machine learning (ML) and doesn't delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, based on general machine learning practices, here are some common preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization/Standardization:**  Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.  Z-score normalization, as described in the text, is one method.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy. This might involve combining variables, transforming them (e.g., taking logarithms), or encoding categorical data.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical features (e.g., text labels) into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
