The provided text does not specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for footprint identification. 

While it mentions using "imperfect footprints" and "missing value imputation," it doesn't detail how these footprints were annotated for training the model. 

Possible techniques that could be used include:

* **Bounding box annotation:**  Drawing boxes around individual footprints in images.
* **Instance segmentation:**  Creating a pixel-level mask for each footprint, distinguishing it from the background.

However, without further information from the source material, we cannot confirm which techniques were employed.
