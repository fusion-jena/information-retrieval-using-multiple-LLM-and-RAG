The provided text focuses on machine learning algorithms like LightGBM, RF, and SVM for predicting forest canopy cover, and doesn't delve into deep learning techniques or data annotation methods.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
