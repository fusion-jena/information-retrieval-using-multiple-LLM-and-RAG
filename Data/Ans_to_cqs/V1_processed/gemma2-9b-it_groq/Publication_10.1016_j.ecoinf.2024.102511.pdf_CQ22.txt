While the provided context discusses deep learning applications in bioacoustics and mentions the development of automated classification routines, it doesn't specify the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. 

However, common metrics used for evaluating classification models in general, and likely in this context as well, include:

* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-score:** A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.

Other relevant metrics might include confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC (Area Under the Curve), depending on the specific task and dataset.
