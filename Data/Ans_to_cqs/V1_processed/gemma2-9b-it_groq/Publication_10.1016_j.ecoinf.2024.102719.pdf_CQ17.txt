The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning, particularly in the context of river health prediction, and discusses bias-variance decomposition for model generalizability.  

While it mentions deep learning models, it doesn't delve into specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting within those models. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.
