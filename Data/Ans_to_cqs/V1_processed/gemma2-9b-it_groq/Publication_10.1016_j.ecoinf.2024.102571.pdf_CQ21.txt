The provided context focuses on presenting data related to different energy sources (WTR, WTI, EL, PZ) and their corresponding per capita GHG emissions. It also includes  "r2" values and "P(Ho)" values, which are likely related to model performance evaluation. 

However, the context does not offer information about specific post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:** These highlight the regions of input data that are most influential in the model's prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  This involves evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., depending on the task.
* **Confusion matrix:** This visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about post-processing steps.
