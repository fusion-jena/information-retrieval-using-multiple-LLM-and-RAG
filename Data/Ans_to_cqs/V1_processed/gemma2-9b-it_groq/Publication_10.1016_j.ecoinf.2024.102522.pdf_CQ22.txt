The provided text focuses on the performance evaluation of a model, but it doesn't specify whether it's a deep learning model. 

The text mentions the following metrics:

* **Correct prediction rate:** This metric indicates the percentage of correctly predicted instances for a specific class (e.g., "present").
* **Prediction accuracy:** This metric represents the overall percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **Overall validation accuracy:** This metric reflects the overall accuracy of the model on the validation dataset. 


While these metrics provide insights into the model's performance, they don't encompass the full range of metrics commonly used to evaluate deep learning models, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
