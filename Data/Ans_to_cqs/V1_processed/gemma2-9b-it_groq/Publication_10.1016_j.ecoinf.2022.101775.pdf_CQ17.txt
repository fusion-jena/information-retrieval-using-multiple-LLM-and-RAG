The provided text mentions "regularized cost function" and "L2 regularization" but doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. 

While it states that the unknown parameters are estimated by minimizing the regularized cost function, it doesn't specify the exact regularization techniques employed. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively list the regularization methods used.
