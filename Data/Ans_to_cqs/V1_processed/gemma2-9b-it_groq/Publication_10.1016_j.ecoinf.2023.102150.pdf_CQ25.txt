The deep learning model described in the text is primarily used for **image classification**. 

The passage states that the model can "separate empty images from images containing an animal," "identify species," "count individuals," and "categorize animal behavior."  All of these tasks fall under the umbrella of image classification, where the model learns to assign labels or categories to images based on their content.
