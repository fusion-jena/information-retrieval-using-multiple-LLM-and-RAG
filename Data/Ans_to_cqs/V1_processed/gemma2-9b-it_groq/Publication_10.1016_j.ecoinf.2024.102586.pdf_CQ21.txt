The provided text focuses on the methodology used for training a random forest model to predict invasive plant species richness and abundance.  It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 


Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after the model training.
