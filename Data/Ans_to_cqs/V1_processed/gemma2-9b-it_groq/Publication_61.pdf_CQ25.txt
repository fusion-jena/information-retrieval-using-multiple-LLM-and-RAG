The provided text focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for plant recognition tasks.  

Based on the context, the deep learning models described are primarily used for **classification**.  

The text mentions:

* **Plant identification:**  CNNs are used to identify different plant species from images.
* **Legume species classification:** A CNN was trained to classify three legume species (white bean, red bean, and soybean).
* **Taxonomic classification of plants:** CNNs are used not only for identifying species but also for broader taxonomic classification.
* **Disease detection:** CNNs are applied to detect diseases that affect plants.
