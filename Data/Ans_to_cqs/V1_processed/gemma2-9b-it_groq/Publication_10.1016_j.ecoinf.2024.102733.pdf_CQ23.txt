The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of the deep learning model, but it doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure its generalizability. 

The text does state that various parameter values were explored and evaluated, suggesting some form of experimentation and tuning. However, it doesn't explicitly describe techniques like:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the dataset's diversity (e.g., representing different scenarios, environments, or subjects) is lacking.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no information about whether the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
