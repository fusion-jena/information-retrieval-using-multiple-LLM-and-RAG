The text describes the use of different dataset subsets corresponding to varying time steps (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days) of flight activity recordings.  The model was trained with these subsets individually and in various combinations (1, 2, 3, or all four). 

Additionally, the data was split into training and validation sets using random selection (70% training, 30% validation). 

However, the text does not explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to enhance the generalizability of deep learning models.
