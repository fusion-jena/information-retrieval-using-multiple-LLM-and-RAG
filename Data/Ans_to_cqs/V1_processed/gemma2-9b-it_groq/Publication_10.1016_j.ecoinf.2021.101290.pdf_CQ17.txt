The provided text focuses on various topics in machine learning, computer vision, and acoustics but doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. 

However,  common regularization techniques to combat overfitting include:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):** Adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This discourages the weights from becoming too large, effectively shrinking them and reducing overfitting.

There are other regularization methods as well, such as L1 regularization (Lasso), early stopping, and data augmentation.
