The provided text does not specify the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation. 

It mentions the importance of tailoring datasets to specific use cases, such as low light, occlusion, or overlapping fish, and training models on these customized datasets.  

The text also suggests using  Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings to enhance fish species detection and classification within the dataset. 


However, it does not name any specific benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that might be employed.
