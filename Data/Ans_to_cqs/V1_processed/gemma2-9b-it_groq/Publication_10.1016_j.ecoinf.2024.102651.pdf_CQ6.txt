The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning application for Cervidae classification and doesn't delve into general preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance by preventing features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy. This might involve techniques like combining features, transforming them, or encoding categorical variables.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, and crops can help improve model generalization. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
