While the provided text focuses on sampling bias in ecological studies and doesn't delve into deep learning preprocessing, I can offer general information about common preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Here are some common preprocessing steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance. Common techniques include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, feature scaling adjusts the range of features to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) need to be converted into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding are commonly used.

* **Data Augmentation:**  This involves creating new training examples from existing ones by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model generalization.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
