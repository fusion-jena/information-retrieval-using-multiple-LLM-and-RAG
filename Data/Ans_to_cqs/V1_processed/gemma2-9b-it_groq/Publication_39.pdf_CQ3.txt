The text describes the use of two main data annotation techniques:

1. **Bounding Box Annotation:** This technique is used for object detection.  The text mentions that for the object detection task, a bounding box is drawn around each animal in a frame of the training set.

2. **Instance Segmentation:** This technique is more detailed than bounding boxes. It involves creating a polygonal segmentation mask that depicts the exact silhouette of each animal in a frame, along with a bounding box and a class label. This is used for the segmentation dataset and is implemented using the VGG Image Annotator (VIA) tool.
