The provided text snippets discuss the use of deep learning for tasks like object detection and segmentation in various contexts (wetlands, mangroves, maize, rubber trees). However, they don't delve into the specific data annotation techniques employed in the deep learning pipelines for these tasks. 

While the text mentions "faster R-CNN" used by Jin et al. (2018) for maize segmentation, it doesn't explicitly state the annotation method used to train this model.  Faster R-CNN is an object detection algorithm that typically relies on bounding box annotations. 

Instance segmentation, which distinguishes individual instances of an object, is also mentioned in the context of tree canopy segmentation (Martins et al., 2021).  

To get a definitive answer about the specific data annotation techniques used in these studies, you would need to refer to the original research papers in their entirety.
