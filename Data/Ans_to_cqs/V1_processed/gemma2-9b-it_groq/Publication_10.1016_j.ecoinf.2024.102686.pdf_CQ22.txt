The provided text focuses on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm for clustering and doesn't mention specific metrics for evaluating a deep learning model's performance.  

Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are commonly used for supervised learning models, not unsupervised clustering algorithms like SOM. 

The text does discuss the "Clustering Quality Index (CQI)" as a metric for evaluating the SOM clustering results.
