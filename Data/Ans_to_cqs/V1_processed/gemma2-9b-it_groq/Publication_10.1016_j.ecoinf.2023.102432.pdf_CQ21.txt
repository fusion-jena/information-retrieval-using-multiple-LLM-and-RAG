The provided text describes the process of training machine learning models for invasive species detection using different image datasets (RapidEye, Landsat, NAIP) and algorithms (Random Forest, MTMI-SMF). 

It mentions the following post-processing steps:

* **Confusion Matrix:** This is calculated to evaluate the model's performance. It shows the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class. The text states that confusion matrices were calculated for each dataset and algorithm using 5-fold cross-validation.
* **Accuracy Metrics:**  The text refers to "overall, producer, and user accuracy" being reported. These are standard metrics used to assess the accuracy of classification models.

The text does not explicitly mention saliency maps. Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize which parts of the input data (in this case, the images) are most influential in the model's decision.
