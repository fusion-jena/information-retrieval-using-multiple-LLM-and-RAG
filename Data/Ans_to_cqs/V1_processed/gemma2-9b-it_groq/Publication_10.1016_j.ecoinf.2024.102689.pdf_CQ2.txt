Based on the provided context, the following data formats are used in deep learning pipelines:

* **Image:**  Several papers mention using images for fish classification and recognition, including  "Laplante, J.F., Akhloufi, M.A., Gervaise, C., 2021. Fish recognition in underwater environments using deep learning and audio data," "Lu, Y.C., Tung, C., Kuo, Y.F., 2020. Identifying the species of harvested tuna and billfish using deep convolutional neural networks," and "Tseng, C.H., Kuo, Y.F., 2020. Detecting and counting harvested fish and identifying fish types in electronic monitoring system videos using deep convolutional neural networks."

* **Audio:** The paper "Laplante, J.F., Akhloufi, M.A., Gervaise, C., 2021. Fish recognition in underwater environments using deep learning and audio data"  explicitly uses audio data in conjunction with images for fish recognition.

* **Video:**  Several papers mention using video data for tasks like fish detection, tracking, and counting, including "Spampinato, C., Chen-Burger, Y.H., Nadarajan, G., Fisher, R.B., 2008. Detecting, tracking and counting fish in low quality unconstrained underwater videos" and "Tamou, A.B., Benzinou, A., Nasreddine, K., Ballihi, L., 2018. Underwater live fish recognition by deep learning."
