The deep learning pipeline uses the following data formats:

* **Audio:** Bird songs are initially in .wav format.
* **Image:** Spectrograms are generated from the .wav files, representing the audio data as images.
* **CSV:** A metadata .csv file stores information about each bird song, including the dialect type, year collected, and file path.
