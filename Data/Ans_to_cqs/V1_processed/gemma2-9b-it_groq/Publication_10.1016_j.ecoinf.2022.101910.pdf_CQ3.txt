The provided text focuses on bird vocalization detection and classification using machine learning, particularly BirdNET. It doesn't delve into the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for training BirdNET. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about the data annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) based on the given context.
