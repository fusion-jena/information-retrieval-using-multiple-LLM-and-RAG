The text mentions several steps taken to improve the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **Diverse Dataset:** The dataset included 35 species and 426,876 images across 12 channels, suggesting a relatively diverse representation of pollen types.
* **Data Augmentation:** Images in the training set were augmented through horizontal and vertical flipping, brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue adjustments. This artificially increases the size and diversity of the training data, exposing the model to variations in image appearance.
* **Splitting into Training, Validation, and Testing Sets:** The data was split into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This allows for evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data and helps prevent overfitting. 

The text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting.
