The provided text explicitly mentions the use of **image** data in the deep learning pipeline. 

It states:

* "We analyze the modelâ€™s behavior by swapping testing sets between pre-processed and raw images"
* "The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species"
* "Further-more, we employ six different commercial cameras to ensure variability and to develop any flexible solution with real-world conditions in the future."


The text focuses on plant species classification, suggesting the use of images as the primary input data.
