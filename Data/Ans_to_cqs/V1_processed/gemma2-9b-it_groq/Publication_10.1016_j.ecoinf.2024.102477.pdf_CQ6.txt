The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly SLSTM and SGRU, for time-series prediction in agriculture and climate science. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training these models. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common preprocessing steps:

* **Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1) can improve model performance.

* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of features to prevent certain features from dominating others during training.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.

The specific preprocessing steps used will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
