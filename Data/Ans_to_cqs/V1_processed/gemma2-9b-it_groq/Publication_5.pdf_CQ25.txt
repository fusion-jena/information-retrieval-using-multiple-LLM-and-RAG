The provided text states that the deep learning model is used for species richness prediction.  It mentions  "Deep Learning-Based Species Richness Model" and  "an artificial neural network mimics the learning process of the human brain and then is expanded to deep learning using deeper network architecture"  in the context of  "From an applied perspective, DL networks are able to automatically learn arbitrary complex mappings from inputs to outputs, and they offer promise for problems with complex nonlinear and multivariate regression."
