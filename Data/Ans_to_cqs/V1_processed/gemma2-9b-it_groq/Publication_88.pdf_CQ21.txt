The provided text focuses on the model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation metrics. It doesn't explicitly describe post-processing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrix calculation, or specific metric calculations beyond Overall Accuracy (OA) and F1-Score. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
