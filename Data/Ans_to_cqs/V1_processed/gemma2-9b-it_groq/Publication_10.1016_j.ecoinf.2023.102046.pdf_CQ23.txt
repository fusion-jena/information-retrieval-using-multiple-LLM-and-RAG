The provided text describes the model training process and hyperparameter choices but doesn't mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  

It states that the dataset was addressed by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function to handle imbalance. However, it doesn't specify if techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset were employed to improve generalization.
