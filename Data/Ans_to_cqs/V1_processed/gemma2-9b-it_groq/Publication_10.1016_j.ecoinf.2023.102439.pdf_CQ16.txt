The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete for the W-ANN model.  It does mention that the number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally increased to find the optimal configuration that yielded the best results. This suggests that the training process was likely monitored based on the model's performance metrics (like R, MSE, RMSE, MAPE) on a validation set. 

A common practice in machine learning is to stop training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data.
