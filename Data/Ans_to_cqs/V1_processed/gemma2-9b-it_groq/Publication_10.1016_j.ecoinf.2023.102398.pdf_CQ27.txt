The provided text describes the deployment process as follows:

1. **Hosting:** The trained model is hosted on a cloud-based system. 
2. **Camera Integration:** A cloud-resident camera is placed in the Kohora range of KNP (Kaziranga National Park). Images captured by this camera are sent to the hosted model for processing.
3. **Cloud Infrastructure:** The deployment utilizes specific cloud computing resources:
    * Processor: Equivalent to Intel Core i9 7980XE @ 2.60 GHz
    * GPU: Tesla T4 GPU
    * Bandwidth: 1Gbps
    * Storage: 100GB
    * Latency: Maximum 50 ms
    * Security: WPA3 secured wireless connectivity
    * Cloud Features: Scalable, resource pooling, secured, economic

The text doesn't explicitly mention the specific process of model serialization or platform selection.
