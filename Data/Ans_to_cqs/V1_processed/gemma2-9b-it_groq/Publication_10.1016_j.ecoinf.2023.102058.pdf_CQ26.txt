The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for water quality prediction. It doesn't delve into specific data preprocessing techniques for addressing bias in deep learning pipelines. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question about techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection from this context.
