The provided text focuses on applications of deep learning in fish recognition and doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, we can infer some possibilities based on the context:

* **Underwater Videos:** Several papers mention using underwater videos for training models. This suggests that video recording equipment deployed in aquatic environments could be a primary data source.
* **Public Datasets:** The text references datasets like LFW (face database) and CelebA (face dataset), implying that researchers might leverage existing public datasets for fish image recognition, especially when specific species or behaviors are targeted.
* **Sensors:** While not directly stated, sensors could play a role in collecting data about fish, such as size, movement patterns, or environmental conditions. This data could be used to augment video-based datasets or train models for specific applications like fish stock monitoring.

It's important to note that this is an educated guess based on the limited information provided.  To get a definitive answer about the specific data collection methods used in each research project, you would need to consult the full papers.
