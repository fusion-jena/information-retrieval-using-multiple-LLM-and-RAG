The provided text states that the data is split into four major modules:

1. **Image Selection:**  Appropriate images are chosen.
2. **Model Training and Validation:** This module involves training and statistically validating the segmentation and species classification models using 5-fold cross-validation.
3. **Prediction:**  The trained models are used for prediction.
4. **Ground Truth Comparison:**  Results are compared with independent "ground truth" based on port sampling of landings.

While the text describes the data flow and modules, it **does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation sets.**
