The provided text describes the use of images for biocrust monitoring. It mentions that these images can be acquired using different camera devices, with varying sensor construction, size, resolution, aperture, field of view, and device settings. 

The text also highlights the use of multispectral or hyperspectral imagery for biocrust monitoring, particularly when cost-intensive airborne data acquisition is possible. However, it doesn't specify the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline beyond mentioning "images" and "camera devices."
