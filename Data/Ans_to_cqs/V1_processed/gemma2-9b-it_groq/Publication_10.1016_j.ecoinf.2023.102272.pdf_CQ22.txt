The provided text states that the performance of the deep learning models was evaluated using **validation accuracy**.  

Specifically, it mentions:

*  "the best validation accuracies were achieved by model 12 in all the years" 
*  "Model 19, also with a DeepConvLSTM architecture had high validation accuracies too"
*  "model 14, a Convolutional Neural Network  (CNN) architecture reaching a validation accuracy of 0.821 Â± 0.005"

The text also mentions **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** as a performance metric, but it doesn't specify which curve it refers to. It provides AUC values for different classes and years in Table 2.
