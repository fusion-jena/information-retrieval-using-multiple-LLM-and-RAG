The provided text focuses on mangrove forest analysis using remote sensing and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  Converting categorical data (e.g., species names) into numerical representations suitable for deep learning algorithms.

* **Splitting into Training and Validation Sets:** Dividing the data into subsets used for training the model and evaluating its performance. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
