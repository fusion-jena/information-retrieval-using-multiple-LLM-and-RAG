The provided text describes the model architecture and training process but doesn't detail specific post-processing steps like saliency map generation, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 


It does mention that after training, the model is used to predict water conditions and analyze performance using a separate test dataset.  This implies that metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are likely calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
