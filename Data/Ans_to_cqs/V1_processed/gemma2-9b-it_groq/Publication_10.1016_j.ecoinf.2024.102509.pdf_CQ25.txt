The provided text focuses on describing the structure and training process of a backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) for regression analysis.  It doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model being used. 

Therefore, based on the context given, I cannot answer what the purpose of the deep learning model is.
