The provided text focuses on the PBP (Pattern-Based Prediction) method and its application in predicting events, particularly outbreaks in aphid populations. It describes the model's training process, hyperparameter selection using cross-validation, and the interpretation of results through a "Pâ€² means" matrix. 

However, the text does not delve into post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction.  Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about specific post-processing steps.
