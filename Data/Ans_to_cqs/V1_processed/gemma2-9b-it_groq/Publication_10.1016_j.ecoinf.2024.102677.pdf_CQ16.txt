The text states that the performance of the validation set guided the final decision on when training was complete.  It also mentions that the model accuracy was continuously assessed using the validation set during training.  

The learning curves in Fig. 6 illustrate a reduction in training losses as the number of epochs increases and convergence within 500 epochs.  Inceptionv3 converges by 400 epochs, while the other networks converge within 150 epochs. 


Based on this information, we can infer that training was likely stopped when the validation loss plateaued or started to increase, indicating overfitting.
