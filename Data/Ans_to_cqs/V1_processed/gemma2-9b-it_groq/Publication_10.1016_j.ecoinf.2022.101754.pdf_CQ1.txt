Based on the provided text snippets, we can infer the following data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline:

* **Field Surveys:**  The text mentions "field data were collected during vegetation season in July 2019 on 109 sample plots" using "Field-Map technology." This indicates the use of field surveys to gather data on tree positions and plot centers.

* **Airborne LiDAR:**  Several references discuss the use of airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for forest biomass estimation and retrieval of forest attributes. LiDAR sensors emit laser pulses and measure the time it takes for the pulses to return, creating a 3D point cloud of the forest environment.

* **Landsat Imagery:** The text cites a study that uses Landsat imagery for aboveground biomass estimation. Landsat satellites provide multispectral imagery of the Earth's surface, which can be used to analyze vegetation characteristics.


It's important to note that the provided text focuses on forestry applications and may not represent the full range of data collection methods used in all deep learning pipelines.
