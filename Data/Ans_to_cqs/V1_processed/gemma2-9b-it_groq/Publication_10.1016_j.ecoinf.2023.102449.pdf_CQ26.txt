The provided text focuses on the architecture of a deep learning model for ecoacoustic analysis and doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing. 

It mentions using a linear transformation to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation, but this doesn't directly address broader data bias issues like class imbalance or representation disparities. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
