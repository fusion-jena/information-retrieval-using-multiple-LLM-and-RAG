The provided text focuses on a study about aboveground biomass estimation using remote sensing and machine learning. It doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on the information given, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Field Surveys:** The text mentions "sampling plots with their above ground biomass values" collected on a specific date. This suggests field surveys were conducted to measure biomass directly.
* **Remote Sensing Data:** The study utilizes Sentinel-2 data, which is a type of satellite imagery. This indicates that remote sensing data is a key source of input for the deep learning model.
* **Soil Data:** The text lists "carbon, soil pH" as environmental variables. This implies the use of soil data, potentially from existing soil databases or measurements.


It's important to note that these are inferences based on the limited information provided. The exact methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not described in the text.
