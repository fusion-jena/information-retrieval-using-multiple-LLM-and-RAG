The text mentions three metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model:

* **Accuracy:**  The percentage of correctly classified instances.
* **AUC (Area Under the Curve):**  A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**  The average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
