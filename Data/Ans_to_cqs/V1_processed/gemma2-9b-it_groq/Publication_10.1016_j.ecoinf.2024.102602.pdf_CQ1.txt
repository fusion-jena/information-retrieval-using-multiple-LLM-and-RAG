The provided text mentions two main methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for monitoring invasive alien plants:

1. **Citizen science and social media platforms:** Data can be gathered through APIs or scraping methods from these platforms. This allows for the collection of a large volume of data relatively quickly and automatically.

2. **Digital images:**  The text highlights the use of deep learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze digital images for detecting and classifying invasive alien plants. These images could originate from various sources, such as:

    * Publicly available image datasets
    * Camera traps
    * User-generated content on social media platforms 


The text doesn't specify other methods like surveys or sensors.
