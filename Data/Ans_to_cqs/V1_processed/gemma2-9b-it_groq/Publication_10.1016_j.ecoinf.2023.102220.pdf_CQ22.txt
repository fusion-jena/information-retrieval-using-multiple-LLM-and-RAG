The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model:

* **Accuracy:**  The text states an accuracy of 84.6% with a standard deviation of 20.5% for the negative binomial (ϕ = 1.2) model and 75.2% with a standard deviation of 18.0% for the Gaussian model.

* **False Positive Rate (FPR):** The text reports an FPR of 14.9% with a standard deviation of 24.2% for the negative binomial (ϕ = 1.2) model and 22.9% with a standard deviation of 22.2% for the Gaussian model.

* **True Positive Rate (TPR):** The text gives a TPR of 59.6% with a standard deviation of 42.0% for the negative binomial (ϕ = 1.2) model and 55.5% with a standard deviation of 37.3% for the Gaussian model.
