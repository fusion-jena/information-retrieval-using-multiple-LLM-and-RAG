The strategy used to monitor model performance during training involves tracking two key metrics:

1. **Training Performance:** Measured using accuracy (proportion of correctly classified cases) on the full training dataset (Bt) for each epoch. This metric reflects how well the model is learning from the training data.

2. **Validation Performance:** Measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the validation dataset (Bv) for each epoch. AUC is a robust metric that evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between classes and is not influenced by class prevalence differences.

By observing the trends in both training and validation performance over epochs, researchers can identify the optimal number of training epochs.  Training is stopped if no improvement in validation performance is observed after 25 epochs.
