The provided text states that the Random Forest (RF) model used in this study generates an "impartial internal estimate of the generalization error by the 'out-of-bag' (OOB) samples". 

Essentially, during training, the RF algorithm uses a subset of the data for each tree.  The "out-of-bag" samples are those data points not included in a particular tree's training set.  By evaluating the model's performance on these OOB samples, an estimate of how well the model will generalize to unseen data can be obtained.
