The provided text describes the training process of a deep learning model but doesn't explicitly mention a specific strategy for monitoring performance during training. 

It does, however, highlight the following aspects that could be indicative of performance monitoring:

* **Mini-batch learning:** The model learns in iterations over smaller batches of images, allowing for adjustments and updates based on the performance on these batches.
* **Loss scores:** The text refers to "loss scores" which are commonly used to evaluate the model's performance during training. Lower loss scores generally indicate better performance.
* **Parameter updates:** The model's internal parameters are updated based on the loss scores, suggesting a feedback loop that adjusts the model based on its performance.


While the text doesn't detail specific metrics or visualizations used for monitoring, these elements suggest that performance was likely tracked and used to guide the training process.
