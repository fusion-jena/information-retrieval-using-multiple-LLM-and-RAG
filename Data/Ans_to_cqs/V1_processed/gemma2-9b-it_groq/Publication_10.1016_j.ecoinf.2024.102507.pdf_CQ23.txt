The provided text focuses on the impact of different data sizes and augmentation techniques on the deep learning model's performance.  It doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:** While the text discusses the imbalance in the dataset due to varying forest type areas, it doesn't elaborate on the dataset's diversity in terms of geographical location, forest types, or other relevant factors.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't mention the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Similarly, there's no information about stratified splitting of the data to ensure representative samples of each forest type in the training and testing sets. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
