The provided text focuses on the LaDeco model's functionality and its underlying deep learning components, particularly semantic segmentation.  

While it mentions semantic segmentation as a key technology, it doesn't delve into the specific data annotation techniques used in the training process of the deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269 model or any other models mentioned. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques were used.
