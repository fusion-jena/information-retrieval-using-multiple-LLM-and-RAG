The provided text focuses on the Wav2Vec model's architecture and training process, particularly self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning.  It doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
