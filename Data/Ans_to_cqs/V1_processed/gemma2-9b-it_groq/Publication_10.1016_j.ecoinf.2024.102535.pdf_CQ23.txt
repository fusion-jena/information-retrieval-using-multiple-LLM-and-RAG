The text mentions that the researchers evaluated the models in "cross-site scenarios" to assess their generalization capacity.  

Specifically, they trained the models with data from one site and then evaluated them with data from a different site. This cross-site evaluation helps determine how well the models can perform on unseen data from locations different from those used in training. 

The text does not mention other techniques like diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
