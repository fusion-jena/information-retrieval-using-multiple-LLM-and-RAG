The provided text focuses on the preprocessing steps of a deep learning pipeline for an agricultural image classification task.  While it mentions data augmentation techniques like brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue modifications, random flips, rotations, and Gaussian noise, it does not explicitly discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what techniques are used to address data bias.
