Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated. 

While several papers discuss using deep learning for tasks like animal detection and counting in the context of remote sensing and UAV imagery, they don't always specify the exact model architecture. 

Some papers mention using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image-based tasks. For example, Le et al. (2022) describe a CNN architecture for automated seabird colony surveys. 

However, without more detailed information from the specific pipeline in question, it's impossible to definitively say what type of deep learning model is employed.
