The provided text describes the data splitting criteria used in this specific study. 

The raw dataset was randomly shuffled before being divided into three sets:

* **Training set (80%):** Used to train the deep learning model by adjusting its parameters to minimize errors.
* **Validation set (10%):** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training and fine-tune its hyperparameters. 
* **Test set (10%):** Used to assess the final performance and generalizability of the trained model on unseen data.

This 8:1:1 ratio was chosen, and the random splitting was repeated ten times to reduce the impact of random variations and ensure consistent performance.
