The provided text snippets do not specify the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipelines described. 

While some papers discuss using MODIS data for vegetation phenology monitoring and Landsat/MODIS data for grassland biomass estimation, they don't mention using these datasets for training deep learning models. 

Similarly, papers on plant species identification using deep learning (Barr´e et al., 2017; Zmarz et al., 2023; W¨aldchen & M¨ader, 2018)  mention image-based approaches but don't explicitly name the specific datasets used for training. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer which datasets are used in the deep learning pipelines.
