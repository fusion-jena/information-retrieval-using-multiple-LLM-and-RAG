The provided text lists several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models:

* **Accuracy:**  Represents the overall correctness of the model.
* **Precision:** Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made.
* **Recall:**  Calculates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases.
* **Specificity:**  Measures the proportion of true negative predictions out of all actual negative cases.
* **F1 Score:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
