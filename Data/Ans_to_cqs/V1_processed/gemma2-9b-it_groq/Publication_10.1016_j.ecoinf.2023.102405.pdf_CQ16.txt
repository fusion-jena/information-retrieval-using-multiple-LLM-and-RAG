The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of the AODEGRU model but doesn't specify the criteria for determining when training is complete. 

Common criteria used to signal the end of training include:

* **Validation Loss Plateau:** If the validation loss stops decreasing and starts to increase or plateau, it suggests the model is overfitting to the training data.

* **Epoch Limit:** Setting a maximum number of training epochs can prevent overtraining.

* **Early Stopping:** This technique monitors the validation loss and stops training if it doesn't improve for a predefined number of epochs.

* **Desired Performance:** Training can be stopped when the model achieves a target accuracy or F-score on the validation set.
