Based on the provided text snippets, we can infer the following data formats used in the deep learning pipeline:

* **Image:** The paper by Nguyen et al. (2019) focuses on "mapping vegetation types" using a "random forest and object-based image approach," suggesting the use of image data.

* **CSV:** While not explicitly stated, the context mentions "modeling increment in diameter of individual trees" and "soil analysis," which often involve tabular data that could be represented in CSV format. 


It's important to note that the provided text doesn't explicitly mention other data formats like audio or video.
