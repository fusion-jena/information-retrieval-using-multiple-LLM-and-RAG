The text mentions the use of stratified sampling to split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. This technique aims to maintain the same distribution of classes in both sets, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. 

The text does not explicitly mention other techniques like cross-validation or the use of a diverse dataset.
