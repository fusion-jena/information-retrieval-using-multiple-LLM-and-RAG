The provided text describes the model evaluation process and metrics but doesn't specify the exact methods used for ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model during its training. 

Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model (e.g., diverse dataset, cross-validation, stratified splitting).
