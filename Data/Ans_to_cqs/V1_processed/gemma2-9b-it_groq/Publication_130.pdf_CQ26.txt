The text describes the use of oversampling and data augmentation to address data bias in the deep learning pipeline. 

* **Oversampling:**  The authors used oversampling to increase the number of training images for the minority class (sociable weavers and great tits with fewer than 350 pictures). This helps balance the dataset and prevent the model from overgeneralizing to the majority class.

* **Data Augmentation:**  The authors used data augmentation by applying transformations to existing images (e.g., using images from different days) to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. This helps the model learn to recognize variations in appearance due to factors like lighting and pose. 


The text does not mention stratified splitting or undersampling.
