The provided text focuses on the training of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models, but it doesn't specify the exact optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

The text mentions the training algorithms "resilient propagation (Rprop)" and "scaled conjugate gradient (SCG)" used for ANNs. While these are optimization algorithms, they are not typically considered standard deep learning optimizers like SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.
