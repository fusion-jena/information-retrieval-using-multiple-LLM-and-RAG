The provided text focuses on the Random Forest model, not a deep learning model.  Therefore, it doesn't describe any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. 

The text does mention the following steps taken to assess the Random Forest model's performance and stability:

* **10-fold cross-validation:** This technique was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, helping to determine its ability to generalize to new instances.
* **Independent test data:**  The model was tested on a separate dataset not used for training to further assess its generalizability.


Let me know if you have any other questions about the Random Forest model or the provided text.
