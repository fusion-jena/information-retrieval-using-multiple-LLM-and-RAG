The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It only mentions that the model was fitted with cow-specific parameters and that the dataset used had a mean minimum frequency of approximately 250 Hz, which differed from the 500 Hz used in a previous study. 


There is no information about data splitting techniques (like cross-validation or stratified splitting) or the diversity of the dataset used for training the model.
