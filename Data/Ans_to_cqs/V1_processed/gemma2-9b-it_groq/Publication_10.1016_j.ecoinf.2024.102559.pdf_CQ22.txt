The provided text focuses on the performance of models using spectral, NDVI, and date features along with average and entropy values, or GLCM features.  It lists several accuracy metrics:

* **Overall Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified samples.
* **Producer's Accuracy:** The proportion of actual positive samples that are correctly classified as positive.
* **User's Accuracy:** The proportion of predicted positive samples that are actually positive. 


The text also provides counts of:

* **True Positives (TP):**  Correctly classified positive samples.
* **True Negatives (TN):** Correctly classified negative samples.
* **False Positives (FP):** Incorrectly classified negative samples as positive.
* **False Negatives (FN):** Incorrectly classified positive samples as negative. 


While the text doesn't explicitly mention precision and recall, these metrics can be derived from the provided TP, FP, and FN values.
