The provided text states that the performance of the deep learning model (SGRU) and other models is evaluated using the following metrics:

* **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):**  This metric calculates the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual values. 
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** This metric measures the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values.
* **RÂ² (R-squared):** This metric represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model.
