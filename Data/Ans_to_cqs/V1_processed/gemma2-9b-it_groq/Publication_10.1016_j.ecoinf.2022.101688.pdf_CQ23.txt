The provided text focuses on the challenges of applying CNNs to bioacoustics research and details the process of determining the optimal input size for the model.  

It does not, however, mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the diversity of the dataset used to train the model is not provided.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There is no mention of stratified splitting of the dataset into training and testing sets. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
