The text mentions that the experimental data was divided into training and test sets using an 8:2 ratio.  This division allows for the evaluation of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. 

Additionally, the model was tested on five additional datasets: Aquarium, Trash-ICRA19, VisDrone, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID. This cross-dataset evaluation further assesses the model's generalizability to different image domains and object categories. 


The text does not describe the use of other techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.
