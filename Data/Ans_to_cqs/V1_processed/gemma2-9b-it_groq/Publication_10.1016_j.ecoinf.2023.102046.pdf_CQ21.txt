The provided text focuses on the training process and performance comparison of different models (CLIP, Inception, ResNet, ViT) for a specific task (likely image classification).  

It doesn't delve into the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which parts of the input image the model focuses on for making a prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  Showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your question about post-processing steps.
