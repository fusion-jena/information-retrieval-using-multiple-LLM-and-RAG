The text describes the use of two hyperparameter optimization techniques: RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. 

RandomizedSearchCV is used first for an initial broad exploration of the hyperparameter space. It randomly samples hyperparameter combinations from a predefined distribution, making it computationally efficient, especially when dealing with large hyperparameter spaces.

Following the random search, GridSearchCV is employed for a more focused and exhaustive search. It evaluates every possible combination of hyperparameters within a predefined grid, ensuring that the optimal combination is found. This method is preferred when the hyperparameter space is relatively smaller and well-defined.

The combination of these two methods allows for a balance between computational efficiency and search precision.
