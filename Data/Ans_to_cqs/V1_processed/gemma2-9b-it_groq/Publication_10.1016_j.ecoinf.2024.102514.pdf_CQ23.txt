The text mentions that the data was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.  It also states that cross-validation is a valuable technique, especially when dealing with limited datasets. 

However, the specific details about how cross-validation was implemented in this study are not provided in the given context.  

Therefore, we can't definitively say what other measures, besides the 80/20 split, were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
