The provided text lists the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning models:

* **Accuracy:**  A measure of the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
* **Fall-out:**  The proportion of actual positive cases that are incorrectly classified as negative.
* **Precision:** The proportion of predicted positive cases that are actually positive.
* **Specificity:** The proportion of actual negative cases that are correctly classified as negative.
* **Recall:** The proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly classified as positive.
* **F1-score:**  A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.
