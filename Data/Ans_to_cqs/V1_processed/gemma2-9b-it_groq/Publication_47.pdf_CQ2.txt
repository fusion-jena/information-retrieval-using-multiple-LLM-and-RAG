The text states that the features used to train the deep learning model are derived from "digitally available occurrence records".  It also lists specific types of data, such as:

* Geographic data (latitude, longitude, range, etc.)
* Climatic data (19 bioclim variables)
* Biome data (presence in 14 biomes)
* Anthropogenic data (Human Footprint Index) 


While it doesn't explicitly say what data format these are stored in, it's likely they are in a structured format like CSV or a similar tabular format suitable for numerical analysis.
