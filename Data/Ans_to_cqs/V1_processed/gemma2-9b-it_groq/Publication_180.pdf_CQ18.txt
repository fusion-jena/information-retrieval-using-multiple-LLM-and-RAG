The strategy used to monitor model performance during training involved tracking two key factors:

1. **Correct Identification Rate:** This metric measured the percentage of images the model correctly classified. The researchers observed that the identification rate improved up to a certain point, then plateaued.  

2. **Processing Time:** This measured the time taken to train the model in hours. It showed a positive linear relationship with the number of training steps.

By balancing these two factors, the researchers aimed to find the optimal number of training steps that yielded the highest identification rate without incurring excessive processing time.
