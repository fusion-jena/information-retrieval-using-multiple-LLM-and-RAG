The provided text lists several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the XGBoost model, but it does not specify the exact metrics used for the deep learning model. 

However, it does mention these common metrics for evaluating classification models:

* **Precision:**  Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall:** Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
* **F1-score:**  The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.
* **Overall Accuracy (OA):** The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances.
* **Kappa:** A statistic that measures inter-rater reliability for categorical items. It accounts for agreement due to chance.
