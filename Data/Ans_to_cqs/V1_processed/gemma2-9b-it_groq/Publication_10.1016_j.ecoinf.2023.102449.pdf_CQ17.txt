The provided text focuses on the architecture of a specific deep learning model for soundscape analysis and doesn't explicitly mention regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting in this pipeline.
