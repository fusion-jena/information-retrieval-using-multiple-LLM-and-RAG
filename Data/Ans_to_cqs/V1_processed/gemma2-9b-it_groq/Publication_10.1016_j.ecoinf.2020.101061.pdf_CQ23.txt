The text describes experiments designed to assess the model's generalization ability across different sites.  

They used three main experimental setups:

1. **Within-site:** Training and evaluating the model on data from the same site.
2. **Cross-site:** Training on data from one site and evaluating on a different site. This helps understand how well the model generalizes to unseen locations.
3. **Transfer learning:** Training on pretraining data from all sites except the evaluation site, and using hand-annotations only from the evaluation site. This tests the model's ability to learn general tree features without local pretraining data.

The text mentions that the sites were selected to be diverse, encompassing a range of tree canopy conditions. This suggests an attempt to build a dataset representative of different environments. 

However, the provided text doesn't explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common practices for ensuring model generalizability.
