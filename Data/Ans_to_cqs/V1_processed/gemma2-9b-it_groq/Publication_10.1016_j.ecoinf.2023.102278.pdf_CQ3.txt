The provided text focuses on the challenges and solutions related to training deep learning models for insect classification, particularly highlighting the need for large, labeled datasets.  

While it mentions "bounding boxes" in the context of the training dataset, it doesn't specify the exact data annotation techniques used beyond that. 

Therefore, based on the given information, I can only say that bounding box annotation is used. I cannot confirm if other techniques like instance segmentation are employed.
