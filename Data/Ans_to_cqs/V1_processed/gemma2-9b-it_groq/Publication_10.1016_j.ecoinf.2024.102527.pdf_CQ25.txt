The provided text focuses on the methodology and architecture of a deep learning model used for transfer learning in the context of empty camera trap image recognition.  

While it describes the model's training process, hyperparameters, and the dataset used, it doesn't explicitly state the model's primary purpose. 

Based on the context, we can infer that the deep learning model is likely used for **classification**.  The text mentions recognizing empty camera trap images, which suggests the model is tasked with categorizing images as either containing an animal or being empty.
