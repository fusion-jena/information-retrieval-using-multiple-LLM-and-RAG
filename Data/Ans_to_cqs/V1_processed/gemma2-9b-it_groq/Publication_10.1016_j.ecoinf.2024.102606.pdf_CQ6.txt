The provided text focuses on the training process and data augmentation techniques used for a specific deep learning model. It doesn't explicitly detail the preprocessing steps involved before training. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer some likely preprocessing steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset. 
* **Normalization:**  Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) is common practice for image data. This helps improve model training stability and convergence.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of numerical features to a standard scale. This can be beneficial for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes.

It's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
