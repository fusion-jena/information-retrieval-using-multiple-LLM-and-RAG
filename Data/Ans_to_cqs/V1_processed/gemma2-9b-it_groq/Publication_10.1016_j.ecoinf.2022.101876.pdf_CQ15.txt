The provided text does not specify the exact optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for MegaDetector.  While it mentions that the model is a state-of-the-art computer vision model based on the Faster R-CNN architecture, it doesn't delve into the specific algorithms used for training. 


Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants (like Adam, RMSprop), but without further information from the source material, we cannot confirm which one(s) were employed in MegaDetector's development.
