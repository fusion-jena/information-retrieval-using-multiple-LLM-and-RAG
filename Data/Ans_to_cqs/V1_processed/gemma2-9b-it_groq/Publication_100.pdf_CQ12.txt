The text states: "At the heart of all of them is the (discrete) convolution operator, i.e., a linear filtering of a c-channel input image with a k×k×c kernel of weights." This, along with the description of layers and the visualization in Fig. 5, clearly indicates that a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** is used in the pipeline.
