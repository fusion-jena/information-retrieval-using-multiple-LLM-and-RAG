The deep learning model described in the text is used for **detection**. 

Specifically, it is designed to detect water sun glint in UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) water images.  The text states that the model "achieves metrics with an Accuracy of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU of 74.73% for water sun glint detection".
