The provided text mentions the use of deep learning in agricultural research, specifically citing  "deep learning (Ren et al., 2021; Wu, 2022)". However, it doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

Strategies to manage randomness in deep learning often involve:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the initialization of weights and other random processes are reproducible. 
* **Using techniques like dropout:** Dropout randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during training, preventing overfitting and introducing some randomness.
* **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each batch, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

For a more detailed explanation of these and other strategies, you would need to consult resources specifically focused on deep learning methodologies.
