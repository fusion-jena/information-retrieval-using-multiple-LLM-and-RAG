The provided text describes a 10-fold cross-validation strategy.  

Here's how the data is split:

* **10-Fold Cross Validation:** The map is divided into 10 sets using a 3x3 grid.  The central cell is split in two, resulting in 10 sets.

* **Training and Evaluation:** During each iteration of the cross-validation, 9 of the 10 sets are used for training the CNN, and the remaining set is used for evaluation.

* **Internal Validation:**  20% of the training data is further reserved as a validation set to monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting. 


The text doesn't explicitly mention separate train, test, and validation sets in the traditional sense. Instead, it uses a cross-validation approach where the data is cyclically partitioned for training and evaluation.
