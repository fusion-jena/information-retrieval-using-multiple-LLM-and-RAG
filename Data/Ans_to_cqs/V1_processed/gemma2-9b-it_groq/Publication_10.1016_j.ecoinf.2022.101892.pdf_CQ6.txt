The provided text focuses on describing different deep learning models (VGG, ResNet, RepVGG, MobileNet-V3) and their applications in age estimation for pandas. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training these models. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning, here are some preprocessing steps typically applied:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves removing irrelevant data, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies. 
* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) helps improve model training stability and convergence.
* **Resizing:** Images are often resized to a standard resolution (e.g., 224x224 pixels) to ensure uniformity for the model.
* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like horizontal flipping, rotation, and cropping are used to artificially increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, reducing overfitting.
