The text describes the use of environmental cross-validation with ten folds to assess the predictive accuracy of the trained models and represent the new environment's predictive error accurately.  

This technique involves splitting the data into ten subsets. The model is trained on nine subsets and tested on the remaining subset. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the test set once. 

The use of ten-fold cross-validation helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize to new, unseen data. 


However, the text does not mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting.
