The text mentions the use of "up to 19 well-established data augmentation techniques commonly used in audio classification" to improve the accuracy and generalizability of the models.  

It also states that these augmentation techniques were selected through an "iterative selection process where only augmentations that enhanced classification performance were selected."

However, the provided context does not specify details about other generalizability measures like:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While it mentions classifying 397 different bird species, it doesn't elaborate on the dataset's diversity in terms of geographical location, habitat, or recording conditions.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting for data partitioning. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we can only conclude that data augmentation was a key strategy for enhancing generalizability.  Further details about other generalizability measures are not provided.
