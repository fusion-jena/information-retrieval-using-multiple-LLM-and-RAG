The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning, particularly deep learning, to hyperspectral data for water quality analysis. It doesn't delve into the specific methods used for collecting the raw data in a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on the context, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Orbital Hyperspectral Data:** The text mentions using "orbital hyperspectral data" for water quality prediction. This suggests that satellites equipped with hyperspectral sensors are likely a primary source of data.
* **Airborne Hyperspectral Imagery:** The text also references "airborne hyperspectral imagery" used for monitoring phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. This indicates that aircraft-mounted hyperspectral sensors could be another data collection method.
* **Laboratory Experiments:** The text cites a laboratory experiment relating spectral reflectance to total suspended solids. This implies that controlled laboratory settings with specialized sensors might contribute to the dataset.


It's important to note that these are inferences based on the limited information provided.  To get a definitive answer on the specific data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline, you would need to consult the original research papers referenced in the text.
