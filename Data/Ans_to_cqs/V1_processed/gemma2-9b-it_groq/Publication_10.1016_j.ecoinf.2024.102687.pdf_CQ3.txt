The provided text focuses on the challenges and solutions related to annotating audio data for bird and frog species identification, particularly in the context of soundscapes. 

It mentions:

* **Weakly labeled data:** Existing annotated databases often have imprecise labels or lack temporal localization details (start and end times of sound events).

* **Interactive visualization techniques:** These techniques are being used to improve annotation quality by allowing experts to visually inspect and refine labels.

* **Automatic sound segmentation:**  Tools that automatically segment bird sounds within soundscape recordings are being developed to assist in creating higher-quality training datasets.

* **Pseudo-labeling functions:** These functions leverage the output of models trained on existing data to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, helping to build larger training datasets with minimal expert annotation effort.
