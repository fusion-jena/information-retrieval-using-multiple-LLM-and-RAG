The provided text mentions that deep learning models can accommodate both structured and unstructured data. 

Specifically, it states: "deep learning models leverage artificial neural networks characterized by multiple layers, allowing them to accommodate both structured and unstructured data, such as images and text [Jafarzadeh et al., 2022]". 


Therefore, deep learning pipelines can utilize data formats like:

* **Images**
* **Text**
* **Audio** (implied by "unstructured data")
* **Video** (implied by "unstructured data") 

It's also possible they could handle other data formats, but the text doesn't explicitly list them.
