The provided text describes the data splitting process for a machine learning model, but it doesn't specify the exact criteria used for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets. 

It does mention:

* **Polygons:** The data was split at the polygon level rather than individual pixels to minimize the impact of spatial autocorrelation.
* **Percentage Split:** Approximately 30% of pixels within each vegetation type (VT) were reserved for independent model validation.


The text doesn't elaborate on how the remaining data was divided between training and testing sets.
