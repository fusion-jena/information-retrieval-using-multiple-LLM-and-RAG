The provided text focuses on the architecture of a specific deep learning model and doesn't discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.  

Techniques commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing include:

* **Stratified splitting:**  Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets while preserving the class distribution of the original data. This helps ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of each class.

* **Oversampling:**  Increasing the number of instances in underrepresented classes by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic data.

* **Undersampling:**  Reducing the number of instances in overrepresented classes to balance the dataset.

* **Diverse data collection:**  Actively seeking out and incorporating data from a wide range of sources and perspectives to minimize biases introduced by a limited or homogeneous dataset.
