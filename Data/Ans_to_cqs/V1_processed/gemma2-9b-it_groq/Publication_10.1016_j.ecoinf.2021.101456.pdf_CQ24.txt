The provided text focuses on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and doesn't delve into general strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, I can offer some common strategies used to manage randomness in deep learning:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This is a fundamental technique. By initializing the random number generator with a specific seed value, you ensure that the same "random" numbers are generated every time you run your code. This makes experiments reproducible.

* **Dropout:**  A regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" (ignored) during each training step. This prevents overfitting and introduces stochasticity into the network, making it more robust.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of each layer during training. This helps stabilize training and can reduce the sensitivity to initial weight values.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing samples. This introduces variation and helps the model generalize better.


Let me know if you have any other questions about VAEs or deep learning concepts.
