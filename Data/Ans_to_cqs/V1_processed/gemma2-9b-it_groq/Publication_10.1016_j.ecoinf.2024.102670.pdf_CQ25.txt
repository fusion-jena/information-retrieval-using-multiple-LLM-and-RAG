The provided text describes several applications of deep learning, but it doesn't explicitly state the purpose of a specific deep learning model. 

Here's what we can infer:

* **Sharma et al. (2017)** used deep learning for **classification**, likely to distinguish between different types of chromosomes based on their karyotype images.
* **Xu et al. (2021)** developed a deep learning model for **segmentation**, aiming to improve the accuracy of identifying specific regions within images compared to existing methods.
* **Guo et al. (2021)** used deep learning for **classification** to identify crossover points/overlaps in 3D volumetric images of filaments.

Therefore, the purpose of deep learning models in these examples varies depending on the specific application.
