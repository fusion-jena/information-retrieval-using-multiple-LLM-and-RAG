The provided text states that the "optimal classification accuracy was obtained" when evaluating the model.  It also mentions the model achieved "100% accuracy" when classifying captive Amur tigers. 

Therefore, we can infer that **accuracy** is at least one metric used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance. 


The text does not mention other metrics like precision or recall.
