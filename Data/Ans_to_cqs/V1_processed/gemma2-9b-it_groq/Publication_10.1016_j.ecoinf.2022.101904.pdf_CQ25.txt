The deep learning model described in the text is primarily used for **classification**. 

The paper focuses on wetland mapping, and the model's goal is to categorize different types of wetland ecosystems (e.g., bog, fen, marsh, swamp, shallow water, urban, deep water, upland) based on remote sensing imagery. 

Evidence for this purpose includes:

* **Table 5:** Presents classification accuracy metrics like Kappa index (KI), Overall accuracy (OA), and Average accuracy (AA) for each wetland class.
* **Figure 8:** Shows classification maps generated by the model for different wetland types.
* **Textual Description:** The authors state they are "exploring and addressing the potential and possible limitations caused by the availability of limited ground-truth data for **large-scale wetland mapping**."  Wetland mapping inherently involves classifying land cover into different wetland categories.
