The provided text focuses on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their application in semi-supervised clustering. It doesn't offer information about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. 

To answer your query, deep learning pipelines can utilize various data collection methods, including:

* **Surveys:** Gathering structured information from individuals through questionnaires.
* **Sensors:** Collecting real-world data from devices like cameras, microphones, GPS trackers, and temperature sensors.
* **Public Datasets:** Accessing pre-existing datasets made available by organizations or researchers. These can cover diverse domains like image recognition, natural language processing, and scientific data.
