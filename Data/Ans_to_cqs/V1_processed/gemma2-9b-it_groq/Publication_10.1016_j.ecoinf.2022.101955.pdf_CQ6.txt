The provided text focuses on the application of various machine learning algorithms, including ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, here are some common preprocessing steps:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips) can improve generalization.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for deep learning models.


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
