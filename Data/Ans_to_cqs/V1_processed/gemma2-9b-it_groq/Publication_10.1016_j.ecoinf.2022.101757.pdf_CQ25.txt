The deep learning model is used for **semantic segmentation**. 

The text states: "Such semantic segmentation or pixel-wise classification was used to locate and delineate artificial and natural objects in photos" and "We address this problem by applying a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Kr¨ahenbühl and Koltun, 2011). The ability to capture fine details with a CRF compensates the limited performance of these kind of nets to generate precisely delineated objects."

Semantic segmentation is a type of image classification that assigns a class label to each pixel in an image. In this case, the model is used to locate and delineate the boundaries of the skyline in photos.
