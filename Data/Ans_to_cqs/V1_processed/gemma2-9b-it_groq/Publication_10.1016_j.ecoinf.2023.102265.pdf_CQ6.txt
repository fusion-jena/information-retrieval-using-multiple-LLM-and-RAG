The provided text focuses on the use of ResNet models for feature extraction in a specific image classification task related to honey bee microhabitats. It doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves removing irrelevant information, such as noise, duplicates, or corrupted data points.

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) helps improve model training stability and convergence.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, crops, and color adjustments. This can enhance model robustness and generalization.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:**  Converting categorical variables (e.g., class labels) into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand. One-hot encoding is a common technique. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
