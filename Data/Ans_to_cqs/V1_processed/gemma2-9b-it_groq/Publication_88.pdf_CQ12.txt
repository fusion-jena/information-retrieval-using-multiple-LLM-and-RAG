The provided text describes the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

Several clues point to this:

* **Terms like "convolutional layers (Conv)", "Max-pooling layers (MaxPool)", and "filter size"** are all characteristic of CNN architectures.
* **The description of the EF and SN models** explicitly mentions these CNN components.
* **The CSVM approach also uses convolutional layers**, although it combines them with Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
