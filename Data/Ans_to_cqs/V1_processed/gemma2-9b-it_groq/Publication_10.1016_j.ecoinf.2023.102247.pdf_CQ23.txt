The provided text describes an ensemble modeling approach using various machine learning algorithms (MaxEnt, RF, SVM, and GLM) but does not mention any deep learning models.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. 


The text does describe the use of cross-validation to test model performance. 70% of the dataset was used for training, and the remaining 30% for testing. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristic Curve (AUC).
