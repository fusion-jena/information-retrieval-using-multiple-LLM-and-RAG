The provided text focuses on the challenges and potential solutions related to data requirements for training deep learning models, particularly in the context of ecological informatics. 

It mentions:

* **Human annotation:**  Humans label data, such as identifying wetlands in maps.
* **Synthetic data generation:** Using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create new data samples based on an existing annotated dataset.

However, the text **does not specify the exact data annotation techniques** used for tasks like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
