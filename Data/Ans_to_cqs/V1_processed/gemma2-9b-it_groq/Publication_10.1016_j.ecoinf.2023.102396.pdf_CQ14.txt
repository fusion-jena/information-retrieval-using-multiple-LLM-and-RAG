The provided text describes the process of fitting state space models to rabbit time series data using the template model builder (TMB) and the R function `optim`. 

It states that `optim` is used to maximize the likelihood function of the state space models to estimate the unknown parameters (a, b, c, and σ²u). 

However, the text does not specify the optimization method used within the `optim` function.  Therefore, it's not possible to determine if grid search, random search, or another method is employed for hyperparameter optimization.
