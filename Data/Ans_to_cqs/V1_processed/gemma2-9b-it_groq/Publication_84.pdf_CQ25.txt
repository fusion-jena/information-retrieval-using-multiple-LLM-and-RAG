The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is **classification**. 

The researchers aim to use the model to distinguish between invasive *Spartina alterniï¬‚ora* and native species in Landsat images.  They specifically evaluate whether incorporating phenological knowledge as input data can enhance the classification performance.
