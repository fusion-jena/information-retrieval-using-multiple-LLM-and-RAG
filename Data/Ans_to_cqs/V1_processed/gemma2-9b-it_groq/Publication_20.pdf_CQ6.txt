The provided text describes the architecture and training process of a deep learning model for fish species identification but doesn't specify the exact preprocessing steps applied to the images before training.  

It mentions using "thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species and environment (T?)" as the training data. This suggests some level of image resizing and potentially cropping to create thumbnails. However, details about normalization, scaling, or other cleaning techniques are not provided.
