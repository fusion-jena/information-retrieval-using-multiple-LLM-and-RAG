The provided text focuses on the Hyperband algorithm for hyperparameter optimization and the architecture of a deep learning model for predicting 137Cs concentrations. It doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

To answer your query about handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Most deep learning libraries allow you to set a random seed. This ensures that the random numbers generated during processes like weight initialization and data shuffling are the same each time you run your code. This reproducibility is crucial for experimentation and comparison.

* **Data Shuffling:** Shuffling your training data before each epoch helps prevent the model from learning patterns that are specific to the order of the data.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch, which can help stabilize training and reduce the impact of random initialization.
