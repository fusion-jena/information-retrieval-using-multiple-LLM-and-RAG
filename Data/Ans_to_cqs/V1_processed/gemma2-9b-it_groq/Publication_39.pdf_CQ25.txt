The provided text describes several deep learning models, including Mask R-CNN and ResNet variants, used for object detection and action recognition.  

Mask R-CNN is specifically designed for **object detection and instance segmentation**.  It identifies objects within an image and draws precise masks around them, outlining their boundaries. 

The ResNet variants are used for **action recognition**, which involves analyzing video sequences to classify the actions performed.
