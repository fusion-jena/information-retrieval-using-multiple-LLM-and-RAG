The provided text mentions the use of  "YOLO models" and "I3Net modules" for weed detection. 

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for object detection. 

I3Net is also a CNN architecture, specifically designed for image classification tasks. 


Therefore, both YOLO and I3Net are types of deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
