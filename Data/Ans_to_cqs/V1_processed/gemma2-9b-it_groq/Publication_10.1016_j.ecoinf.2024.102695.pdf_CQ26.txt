The provided text focuses on the implementation of a Transformer model for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations and doesn't delve into specific data bias mitigation techniques used during preprocessing. 

However, it does mention that the dataset is divided chronologically into training, validation, and test sets (70%, 10%, and 20% respectively) to prevent data snooping bias. This strategy ensures that the model doesn't learn patterns specific to a particular time period in the data, improving its generalizability. 


The text doesn't explicitly discuss other common techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
