The provided text does not describe specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as data diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

It mentions using a pre-trained ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset, which contains a large variety of images.  However, it doesn't detail how the specific dataset used for training the model in this study was constructed or whether techniques like cross-validation were employed to assess its generalizability.
