The provided text mentions data augmentation as a technique used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. 

Data augmentation involves applying transformations to existing data to generate new, slightly different images while maintaining the same class. This technique helps balance the data by increasing the number of examples for underrepresented classes. 

While the text doesn't explicitly list other techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it does highlight the importance of acquiring more unique data samples for training to further improve accuracy. This suggests that these techniques could also be employed to mitigate data bias.
