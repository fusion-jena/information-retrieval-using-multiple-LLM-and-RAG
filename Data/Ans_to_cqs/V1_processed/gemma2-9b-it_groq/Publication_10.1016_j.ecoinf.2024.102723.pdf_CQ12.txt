The provided text describes the use of a **feedforward neural network**. 

While it doesn't explicitly state "CNN", "RNN", or "Transformer", the description focuses on:

* **Dense layers:** These are fully connected layers, a fundamental building block of feedforward networks.
* **Sequential architecture:** The text describes layers stacked on top of each other (input, hidden, output), characteristic of feedforward networks.
* **No recurrent or convolutional structures:** There's no mention of recurrent connections (like in RNNs) or convolutional filters (like in CNNs), which are key components of those architectures.
