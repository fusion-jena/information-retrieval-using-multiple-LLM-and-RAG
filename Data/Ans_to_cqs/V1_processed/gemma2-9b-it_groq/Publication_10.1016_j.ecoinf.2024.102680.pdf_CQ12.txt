The provided text mentions the use of  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  like ResNet50 and CSPDarknet, as well as  Vision Transformers  like DP-FishNet.  

It also discusses  YOLOv8, which is a type of object detection model built upon a CNN architecture.  

Therefore, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are primarily CNNs and Vision Transformers.
