The provided text focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their hyperparameters. It doesn't specify the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on common knowledge about deep learning, here are some data formats frequently used:

* **Image:**  Images are a common input for CNNs, often in formats like JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.
* **Audio:**  Audio data is often represented as waveform data or spectrograms and can be in formats like WAV, MP3, or FLAC.
* **Video:**  Videos are sequences of images and can be processed frame-by-frame using CNNs. Formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are common.
* **Text:**  Text data is often represented as sequences of words or characters and can be processed using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers.

* **CSV:**  CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a simple text-based format often used for tabular data. While not directly image, audio, or video data, it can be used to store features extracted from these data types.
