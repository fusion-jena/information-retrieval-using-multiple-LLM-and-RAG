The provided text focuses on the model training process and performance evaluation, particularly for rice canopy coverage estimation.  It mentions metrics like R-squared (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Relative Percentage Error (REP) used to assess the model's accuracy. 

However, it doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  These are used to visualize which input features (e.g., pixels in an image) are most influential in the model's prediction.
* **Confusion matrix:** This matrix helps analyze the types of errors the model makes by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide details on the exact post-processing steps employed.
