The provided text does not describe any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. It focuses on other aspects of image classification, such as:

* **Training data augmentation:**  The text mentions training data augmentation in general, but it doesn't specify the exact techniques used (e.g., flipping, rotating, scaling).
* **Post-classification techniques:**  The text discusses post-classification methods like segmentation and filtering to improve map quality.
* **Data preprocessing:** It mentions strategies for dealing with training data geometry, such as outlier exclusion and data proportion adjustments.
* **Feature selection:** The text describes the use of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most important variables for classification.
