The provided text focuses on a deep learning pipeline for snow leopard identification and doesn't specify the exact datasets used for training. 

It mentions:

* **The largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research** compiled for this work, hosted on Whiskerbook.org.
* **A Min-3/Max-10 data subset** frequently used for training machine learning algorithms like PIE. This subset likely contains variations of snow leopard images.
* **Left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques** used to increase the dataset size and prevent overfitting.

While the text doesn't name standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it implies the primary dataset used is the one they created for snow leopard identification.
