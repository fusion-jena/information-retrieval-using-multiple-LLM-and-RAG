The provided text describes the model selection process and performance evaluation metrics but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance *during* training. 


It does mention using cross-validation and evaluating the models using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics. However, it doesn't detail how these metrics were used during the training process itself.
