The provided text focuses on the dataset used for training a digit recognition model and doesn't describe specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. 

While it mentions image preprocessing steps like inversion using OpenCV, it doesn't elaborate on methods to handle imbalances or biases within the dataset itself. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
