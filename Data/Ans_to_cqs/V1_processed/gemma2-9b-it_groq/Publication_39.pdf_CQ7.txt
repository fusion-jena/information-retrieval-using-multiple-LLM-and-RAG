The data is split into three sets: train, validation, and test. 

* The test set includes 20% of the video clips from each class. 
*  Another 20% of the video clips from each class form the validation set. 
* The remaining clips constitute the training set. 

This splitting is done randomly but remains fixed for all experiments and networks.
