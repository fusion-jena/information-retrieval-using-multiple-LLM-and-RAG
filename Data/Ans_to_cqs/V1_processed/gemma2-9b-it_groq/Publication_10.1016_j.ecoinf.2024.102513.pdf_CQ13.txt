The provided text does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for LULC classification.  

While it describes the architecture of the model (convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and output layer), it doesn't delve into the specific settings for hyperparameters like:

* **Learning rate:**  This controls the step size during weight updates.
* **Optimizer:** Algorithms like Adam, SGD, or RMSprop are used to adjust weights.
* **Number of layers:** The depth of the network.
* **Number of neurons per layer:**  The width of the network.
* **Activation functions:**  Types used in different layers (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid).
* **Batch size:** The number of samples processed in each training iteration.
* **Regularization techniques:** Methods like dropout or L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. 


To find the precise hyperparameters used in this model, you would need to consult the original research paper or code implementation.
