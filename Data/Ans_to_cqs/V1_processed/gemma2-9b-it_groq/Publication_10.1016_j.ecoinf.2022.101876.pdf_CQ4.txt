The provided text does not specify the exact data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for processing wildlife camera trap images.  While it mentions the use of a state-of-the-art computer vision model called MegaDetector, it does not delve into the specific preprocessing steps or augmentation techniques applied to the images. 


Common data augmentation techniques used in computer vision tasks like image classification and object detection include:

* **Flipping:**  Horizontally or vertically flipping images to increase dataset size and improve model robustness to image orientation.
* **Rotation:** Rotating images by a certain angle to make the model invariant to object position within the image.
* **Scaling:**  Enlarging or shrinking images to different proportions, helping the model generalize to varying object sizes.
* **Color Jitter:**  Slightly altering the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of images to increase model resilience to variations in lighting and color conditions.


To determine the precise data augmentation techniques used in this specific study, you would need to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly.
