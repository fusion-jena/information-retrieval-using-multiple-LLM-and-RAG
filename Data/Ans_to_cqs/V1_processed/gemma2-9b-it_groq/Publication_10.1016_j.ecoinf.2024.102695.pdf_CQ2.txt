The provided text focuses on the architecture and methodology of a deep learning model for predicting multivariate marine chemical data.  It doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the pipeline. 

However, we can infer some information:

* **Multivariate data:** The model is designed to handle "multivariate input," suggesting the data likely consists of multiple variables measured over time.
* **Time series data:** The text repeatedly mentions "time series data" and "future prediction length," implying the data is structured as a sequence of observations over time.

Based on these clues, the data format could be a time series representation, potentially stored in a format like:

* **CSV:**  Comma-separated values, suitable for tabular data with timestamps and multiple measurements.
* **NetCDF:**  Network Common Data Form, often used for scientific data, including time series.
* **Other specialized formats:**  Depending on the specific source of the marine chemical data, there might be domain-specific formats. 



Without further information from the source, it's impossible to definitively state the exact data format used.
