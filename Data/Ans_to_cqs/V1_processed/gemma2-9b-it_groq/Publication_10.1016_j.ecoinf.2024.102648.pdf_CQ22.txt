The provided text focuses on comparing different models for predicting CLCuD (Cotton Leaf Curl Disease) in upland cotton.  

It mentions the following metrics for evaluating model performance:

* **R-squared (RÂ²)**:  A measure of how well the model fits the data. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.
* **Root Average Squared Errors (RASE)**:  A measure of the average magnitude of the errors made by the model. Lower values indicate better performance.
* **Average Absolute Error (AAE)**:  Another measure of the average magnitude of errors, similar to RASE. 


The text does not explicitly mention metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
