The provided text does not specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for detecting man-made objects. 

While it mentions the use of supervised Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches, it doesn't delve into the specific annotation methods employed for training these models. 

Possible techniques that could be used include:

* **Bounding box annotation:**  Drawing rectangular boxes around each man-made object in the images.
* **Instance segmentation:**  Creating a segmentation mask for each individual man-made object, outlining its precise shape.

However, without further information from the source material, we cannot confirm which techniques were actually used.
