The provided text focuses on the implementation of a Wavelet Transform Hidden Markov Model (WT-HMM) for classifying blue whale vocalizations and noise. It doesn't delve into the preprocessing steps typically involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:**  Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms. 


Let me know if you have any other questions about WT-HMMs or need further clarification on deep learning preprocessing techniques.
