The provided text mentions data augmentation as a preprocessing step used to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks. 

While the text doesn't specify the exact techniques used within data augmentation, it implies the use of methods that artificially increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.  Common data augmentation techniques include:

* **Image transformations:**  Rotating, flipping, cropping, and scaling images.
* **Color space manipulation:** Adjusting brightness, contrast, and saturation.
* **Adding noise:** Introducing random noise to images.

These techniques help to create a more robust model that is less susceptible to overfitting and performs better on unseen data.
