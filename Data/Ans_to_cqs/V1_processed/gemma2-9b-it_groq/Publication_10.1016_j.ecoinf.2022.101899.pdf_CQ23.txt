The provided text does not describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It focuses on the model's development and the use of Bayesian model averaging to account for uncertainty across different predictor combinations. 

The text mentions the use of historical environmental conditions before and after wildfires to train the model, but it doesn't detail the dataset's diversity, the use of cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques.
