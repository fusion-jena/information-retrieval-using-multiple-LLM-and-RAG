The text mentions the use of two main datasets:

1. **FishInTurbidWater:** This is a dataset specifically collected for this research, containing videos of fish in turbid water. It was weakly labeled to contribute to the first weakly-supervised fish dataset in turbid waters.

2. **ImageNet:** This is a large, publicly available dataset of over 14 million images, hand-annotated with bounding boxes for object recognition tasks. It was used to pre-train two deep learning models (EfficientNet and ViT) before fine-tuning them on the FishInTurbidWater dataset.
