The provided text focuses on bird vocalization classification using deep learning models and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However,  it does mention techniques like:

* **Data Augmentation:**  Methods like adding background noise, random clipping, and splicing are used to artificially increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. This introduces controlled randomness to improve model robustness.

* **Stratified Sampling:**  This technique ensures that the training, validation, and testing sets maintain the same class distribution as the original dataset. While not directly addressing randomness in the model training process, it helps mitigate potential biases introduced by random data splits.


To get a comprehensive answer about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value), you'd need to consult resources specifically addressing machine learning best practices and hyperparameter tuning.
