The text provides information about four metrics used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms:

* **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**:  Calculates the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted values (Ì‚yi) and the actual values (yi).

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:  Measures the average magnitude of the errors, regardless of direction.

* **Mean Relative Error (MRE)**:  Calculates the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual values.

* **Accuracy**:  The ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.
