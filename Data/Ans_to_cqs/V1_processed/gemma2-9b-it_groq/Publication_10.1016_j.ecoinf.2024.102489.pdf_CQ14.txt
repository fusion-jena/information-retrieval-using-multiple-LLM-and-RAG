The provided text states that a grid search method called GridSearchCV was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model.  

This method systematically searches through a predefined set of hyperparameter values to find the combination that results in the best model performance.  

The text specifies that the grid search considered different values for `n_estimators`, `minleaf`, and `max_features`, using out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each combination.
