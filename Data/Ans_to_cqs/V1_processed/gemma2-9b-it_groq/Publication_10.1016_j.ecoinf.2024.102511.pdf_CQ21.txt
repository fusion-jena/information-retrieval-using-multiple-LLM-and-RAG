The provided text focuses on the development and application of a machine learning model for classifying beaked whale echolocation pulses. While it describes the model training process, it doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
