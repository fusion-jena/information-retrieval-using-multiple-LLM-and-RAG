The text explicitly states that a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** is used in the pipeline.  

Several clues point to this:

*  The phrase "deep CNN networks" is used.
*  The text discusses the use of AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet, which are all types of CNNs.
*  The authors analyze the "global response of filters in each convolution layer" and the "local responses of individual filters in each convolution layer," which are characteristic of CNNs.
