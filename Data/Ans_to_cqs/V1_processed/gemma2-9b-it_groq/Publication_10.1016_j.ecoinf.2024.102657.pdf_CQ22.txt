The provided text describes the experimental setup and data used for training a CNN and k-NN model but doesn't specify the exact metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance. 

However, it does mention:

* **Accuracy:**  The text states that the CNN's accuracy on noise-filtered data and raw data was similar (99.22% and 99.25% respectively). This suggests accuracy was at least one metric used.
* **Match/Mismatch:** The text presents a breakdown of test results based on whether the CNN and k-NN classifications matched or mismatched, and whether both models were correct or incorrect. This indicates an evaluation based on classification agreement.


Therefore, while the text doesn't explicitly list all the metrics, **accuracy** and some form of **classification agreement** are implied to be used in the evaluation.
