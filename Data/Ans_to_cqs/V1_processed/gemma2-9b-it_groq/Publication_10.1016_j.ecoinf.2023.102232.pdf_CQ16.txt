The provided text describes a two-step algorithm for parameter estimation in a physiologically based model of insect stage development. It details the process of using a least squares (LS) algorithm followed by a genetic algorithm (GA) to refine the parameter estimates. 

However, the text does not mention any criteria for determining when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau.
