The text mentions the use of several deep learning models: convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). 

Specifically, the synthetic connectivity data was generated using a GAN model. The initial coral cover data model was developed using a TVAE (Time-Varying Variational Autoencoder) model.
