The provided text focuses on the application of Vision Transformers (ViT) for image recognition.  

While it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning model described in the context, it heavily implies that the model is designed for **image classification**. 

Here's why:

* **Sika deer identification:** The text mentions the goal of creating a model to "accurately identify sika deer." This suggests a classification task where the model aims to categorize images as either containing a sika deer or not.
* **Comparison to CNNs:** The text contrasts ViT with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image classification. 
* **Focus on global attention:** The text highlights ViT's ability to model global relationships between image features through self-attention, a mechanism particularly beneficial for understanding the overall content of an image, crucial for classification. 


Therefore, based on the context, it's highly likely that the deep learning model is intended for **image classification** of sika deer.
