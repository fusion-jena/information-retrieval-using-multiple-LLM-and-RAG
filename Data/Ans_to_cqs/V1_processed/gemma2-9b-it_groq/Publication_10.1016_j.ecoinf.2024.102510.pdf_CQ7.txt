The provided text describes the use of three data split strategies: 60:40, 80:20, and 90:10.  

These splits designate the proportion of the dataset allocated to training, validation, and testing. 

* **Training set:** Used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships within this data.
* **Validation set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps monitor how well the model is generalizing to unseen data and prevents overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).
* **Testing set:** Used for a final evaluation of the trained model's performance on completely unseen data. This provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios. 


The text states that these splits were used to "evaluate the abilities of different models to learn from a larger dataset and identify any underfitting/overfitting issues."
