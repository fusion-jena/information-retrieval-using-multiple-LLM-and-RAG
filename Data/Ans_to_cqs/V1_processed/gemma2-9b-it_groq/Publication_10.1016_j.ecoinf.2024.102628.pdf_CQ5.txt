The provided text mentions using a pretrained ResNet-34 model, which is typically pre-trained on a large dataset like ImageNet.  

It also states that the dataset used in this study is relatively small and that multi-temporal data from three months (March, September, and October 2015) across three environments was incorporated to expand the dataset. 

However, the specific name of the primary dataset used for training and testing, besides ImageNet for pre-training ResNet-34, is not mentioned in the text.
