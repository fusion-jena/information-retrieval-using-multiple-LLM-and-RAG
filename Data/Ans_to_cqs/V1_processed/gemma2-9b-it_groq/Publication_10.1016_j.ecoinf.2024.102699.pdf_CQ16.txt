The provided text states that "Early stopping was introduced to prevent overfitting when no further improvement is observed."  

Therefore, the training is likely considered complete when no further improvement is observed on the validation set. This suggests that the validation loss is monitored, and training stops when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase.
