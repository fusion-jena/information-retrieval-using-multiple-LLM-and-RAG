The provided text mentions TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite. 

It states: "The model can then be used on an edge device for classification of as yet unseen images. The TensorFlow or TensorFlow Lite model may also optionally be optimized for size, or latency depending on the application requirements and the edge device specifications." 


Therefore, TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite are frameworks used to build the deep learning model.
