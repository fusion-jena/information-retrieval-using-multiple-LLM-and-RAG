The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating deep learning models:

* **Accuracy:**  This metric is used to assess the overall correctness of the model's predictions. 
* **Precision:**  This metric measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.
* **Recall:** This metric measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances.
* **AP (Average Precision):** This metric is often used in object detection tasks and represents the average precision across different recall levels. 


The text also mentions **CIoU, WIoU, SIoU, EIoU, and Î±-IoU**, which are likely variations of Intersection over Union (IoU) used for evaluating object detection models.
