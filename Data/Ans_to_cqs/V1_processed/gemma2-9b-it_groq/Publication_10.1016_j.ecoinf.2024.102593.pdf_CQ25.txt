The provided text focuses on using embeddings from a deep learning model (BirdNET) to train new models for classifying unseen bird species.  

While it describes the process of training and evaluating these models, it doesn't explicitly state the primary purpose of the original BirdNET model. 

Based on the context, it's highly likely that BirdNET, like the models being trained with its embeddings, is primarily used for **bird species classification**.
