The provided text focuses on the development and training of a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. It describes the model's structure, the training process using the 'neuralnet' package in R, and the importance of dataset quality and network optimization. 

However, the text does not delve into post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction.  Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context.
