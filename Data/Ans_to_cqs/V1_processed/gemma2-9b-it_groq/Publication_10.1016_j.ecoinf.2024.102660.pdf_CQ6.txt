The provided text focuses on the architecture and training process of a specific deep learning model (Res_AUNet) for water sun glint detection. It doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps often include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.
* **Normalization/Scaling:**  Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.
* **Image Resizing:** Images are often resized to a standard size to ensure consistency for the model's input. The text mentions images being cropped to 256x256 pixels.
* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like random rotations, flips, and other transformations are applied to increase the size and diversity of the training data, helping the model generalize better. The text states that random rotations and flips were used to augment the training images. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
