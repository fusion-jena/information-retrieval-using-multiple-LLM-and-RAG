While the provided text discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, it doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting categorical data into numerical representations suitable for deep learning algorithms.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips) to existing data. 


Keep in mind that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
