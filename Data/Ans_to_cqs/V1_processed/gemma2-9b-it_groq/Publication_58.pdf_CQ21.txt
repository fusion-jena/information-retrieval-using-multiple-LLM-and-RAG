After training the Deep Learning models and XGBoost, the following post-processing steps were performed:

1. **Mapping:** The trained models were applied to the test set (a separate, isolated scene) to generate complete land cover (LC) and land use (LU) maps.

2. **Confusion Matrix Calculation:** Confusion matrices were created for both LC and LU classification tasks based on the model's predictions compared to the ground truth labels in the test set.

3. **Quality Metric Evaluation:** Four quality metrics were used to assess the performance of the models:
    * **Overall Accuracy (OA):**  Measures the overall correctness of the classification by summing the diagonal elements of the confusion matrix.
    * **Producer Accuracy (PA):**  Indicates the proportion of correctly classified instances of each class out of all instances of that class.
    * **User Accuracy (UA):**  Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances of each class out of all instances that were predicted to belong to that class.
    * **F1-score:**  Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure that considers both PA and UA.

4. **Shadow and Cloud Exclusion:**  Shadow and cloud areas were excluded from the confusion matrix calculations.
