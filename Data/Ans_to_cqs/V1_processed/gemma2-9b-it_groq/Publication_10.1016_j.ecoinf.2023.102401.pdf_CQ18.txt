The provided text describes a model evaluation strategy after training, not a strategy for monitoring performance *during* training. 

The text outlines steps for:

1. **Training:** Using the PyTorch framework, SGD optimizer, and a specified GPU and CPU configuration.
2. **Validation:** Evaluating the trained model against a test dataset using metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, and mAP.
3. **Iteration:** Adjusting model parameters and structure based on evaluation results and repeating the training and evaluation process.


There is no mention of techniques used to monitor performance *in real-time* during the training process.
