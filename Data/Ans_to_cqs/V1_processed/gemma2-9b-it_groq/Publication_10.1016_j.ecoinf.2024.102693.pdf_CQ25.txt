The provided text focuses on describing different types of deep learning models (CNN-like, Transformer-like, and MLP-like) and their architectures.  

It doesn't explicitly state the purpose of these models. However, based on the context, we can infer that these models are likely used for **image recognition tasks**. 

The text mentions:

* **Downstream tasks:** This term often refers to specific applications built upon a pre-trained model, such as classification, detection, or segmentation.
* **Classification:** The text mentions a fully connected layer at the end of ResNet-50, which is a common component for image classification tasks.


Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that these deep learning models are designed for tasks like **image classification**,  **object detection**, or **image segmentation**.
