The text describes the use of a split dataset to evaluate the model's generalizability:

* **Training set (82%):** Used to train the model and adjust its parameters.
* **Validation set (13%):** Used during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess performance on unseen data, helping prevent overfitting.
* **Testing set (5%):** Used as an independent evaluation of the model's performance on completely unseen data.

The text also mentions data augmentation techniques, specifically random saturation adjustments, which were used to increase the diversity of the training data. 


While the text doesn't explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, the use of a validation set and testing set suggests an approach to evaluating the model's ability to generalize to new data.
