The provided text focuses on the challenges of transfer learning and model validation in deep learning, particularly in the context of remote sensing. It mentions the use of hyperparameter search to optimize model performance but doesn't delve into specific regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.
