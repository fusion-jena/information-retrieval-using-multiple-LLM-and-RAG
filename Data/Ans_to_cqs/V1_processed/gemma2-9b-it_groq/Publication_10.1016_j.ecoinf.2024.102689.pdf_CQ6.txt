The provided text focuses on deep learning applications in fish recognition and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps for training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) helps improve model training stability and convergence.

* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping can be applied to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, enhancing model robustness.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes improve model performance. This step is specific to the problem domain and may involve extracting relevant information from the data. 


Keep in mind that the exact preprocessing steps depend on the specific deep learning model, dataset, and task.
