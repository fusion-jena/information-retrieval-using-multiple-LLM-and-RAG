The provided text focuses on the architecture and improvements of a specific deep learning model (MSNet) used in the Deep SORT algorithm for multi-object tracking. It doesn't delve into the general preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, and crops can help improve generalization. 


Let me know if you have any other questions about the Deep SORT algorithm or MSNet.
