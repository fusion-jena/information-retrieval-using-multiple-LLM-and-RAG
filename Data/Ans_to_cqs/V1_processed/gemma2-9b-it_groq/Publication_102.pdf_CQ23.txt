The provided text describes the data splitting process (80% training, 20% testing) for both the SSLs and elephants datasets. It also mentions the use of early stopping during training to prevent overfitting. 

However, the text does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model beyond these techniques, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  Information about the diversity of the datasets (e.g., variations in lighting, pose, background) is not provided.
* **Cross-validation:** The text does not describe the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There is no mention of stratified splitting, which ensures that the class distribution is maintained in both the training and testing sets.
