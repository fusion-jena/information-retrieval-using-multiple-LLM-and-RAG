The provided text focuses on the methodology used for training and evaluating machine learning models (RF, SVM, MARS) rather than deep learning models.  

Therefore, it doesn't describe specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. 

However, the text does mention some strategies that are commonly used to improve the generalizability of machine learning models, such as:

* **Data Augmentation:**  Extending the training data can enhance the model's ability to generalize.
* **Cross-Validation:**  10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions was used during the model building phase to assess model performance and find the best models. This helps to avoid overfitting to the training data. 
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  A grid search was conducted to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model, further contributing to better generalization.
