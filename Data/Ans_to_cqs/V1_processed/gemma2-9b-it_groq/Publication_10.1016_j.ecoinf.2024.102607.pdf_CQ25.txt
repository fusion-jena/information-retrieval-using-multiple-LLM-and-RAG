The provided text focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms, particularly Random Forests (RF), for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping.  

While it mentions artificial neural networks (ANNs) as another type of ML algorithm used in LULC mapping, it doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning models or their purposes. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what the purpose of a deep learning model is.
