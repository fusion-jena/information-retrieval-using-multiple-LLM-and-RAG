The provided text focuses on the STARdbi pipeline and doesn't explicitly mention other datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in its development. 

The text highlights that STARdbi utilizes images captured from sticky traps containing insects. These images are stored in a public database and used to train machine learning models for insect identification. 

While the text doesn't name specific datasets besides STARdbi itself, it does mention that the pipeline incorporates a ResNet152 model (He et al., 2015). ResNet152 is a pre-trained convolutional neural network architecture that has been widely used in image classification tasks and is likely pre-trained on a large-scale dataset like ImageNet.
