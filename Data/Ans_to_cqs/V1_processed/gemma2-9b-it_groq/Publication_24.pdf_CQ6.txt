The text describes several preprocessing steps used for spectrograms before training a CNN for sound classification. These include:

* **Different Normalization Strategies:** Four different normalization strategies were applied to each spectrogram, though the specific strategies are not detailed in the provided text. 
* **Whitening:** This technique, mentioned in the context, aims to make the data have zero mean and unit variance across all features.
* **Mean Subtraction:** This involves subtracting the mean value of each frequency bin from the spectrogram. 


The text emphasizes that these preprocessing steps are crucial for improving the performance of the CNN classifier.
