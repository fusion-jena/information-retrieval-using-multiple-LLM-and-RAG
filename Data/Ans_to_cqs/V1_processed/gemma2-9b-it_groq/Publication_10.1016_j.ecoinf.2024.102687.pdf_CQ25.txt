The provided text focuses on using deep learning models for clustering bird sounds, not for classification, segmentation, or detection. 

The text describes experiments with various CNN backbones (like DenseNet) fine-tuned for clustering bird sounds using methods like Matching Networks, Prototypical Networks, and Relation Networks.  

The goal is to group similar bird sounds together (clustering) based on their spectrograms, which can aid in ecoacoustic research.
