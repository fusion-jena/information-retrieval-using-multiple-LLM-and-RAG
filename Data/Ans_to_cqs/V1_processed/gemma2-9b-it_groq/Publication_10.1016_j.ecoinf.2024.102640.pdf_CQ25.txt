The deep learning model SegFormer, used in GreenCam, is designed for **semantic segmentation**. 

The text states: "In GreenCam, we measure photo GVI by SegFormer (Xie et al., 2021), a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for **semantic segmentation**." 


Semantic segmentation is a task where a model assigns a class label to each pixel in an image. In the context of GreenCam, SegFormer is used to segment the green vegetation (GVI) from the rest of the image.
