The hyperparameters of the models are optimized using a **randomized grid search**.  

This technique is described as a powerful optimization method that differs from traditional grid search by randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore. This approach is computationally more efficient, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, and has been shown to find equally or more optimal solutions than exhaustive grid search.
