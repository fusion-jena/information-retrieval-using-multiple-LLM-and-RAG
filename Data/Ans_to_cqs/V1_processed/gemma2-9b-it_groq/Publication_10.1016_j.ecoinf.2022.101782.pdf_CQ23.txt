The provided text describes the training process of the deep learning model but doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure its generalizability. 

It mentions:

* **Image augmentation:** Techniques like horizontal flip, shear, and random zoom were applied to the training data, which can help the model learn more robust features and generalize better.
* **Training and validation sets:** The model was trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on a separate validation set. This helps assess the model's performance on unseen data.

However, the text doesn't mention:

* **Dataset diversity:**  Whether the dataset used for training was diverse enough to represent different variations of red kites.
* **Cross-validation:**  A technique that involves splitting the data into multiple folds and training the model on different combinations of these folds. This can provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
* **Stratified splitting:** A technique for splitting the data while preserving the proportion of different classes (in this case, red kites and non-red kites).


Therefore, based on the provided information, we can't definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
