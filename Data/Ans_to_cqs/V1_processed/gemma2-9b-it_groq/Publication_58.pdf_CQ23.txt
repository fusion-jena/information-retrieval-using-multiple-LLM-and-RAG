The text describes splitting the SPOT6 satellite data into three sets: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set.  The learning and validation sets were used to train and tune the models, while the independent test set was used to evaluate the final performance of the models. 

The text also mentions that four of the five study areas were used for learning and validation, and the remaining area was used as the isolated test set. This suggests a form of spatial cross-validation, where different areas are used for training and testing. 

However, the text does not explicitly mention techniques like diverse dataset creation, cross-validation strategies (e.g., k-fold), or stratified splitting.
