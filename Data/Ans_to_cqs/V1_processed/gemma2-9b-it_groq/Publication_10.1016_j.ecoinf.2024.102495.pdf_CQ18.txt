The provided text describes the performance of different deep learning model configurations but doesn't explicitly detail the strategy used to monitor performance during training. 

We can infer some information:

* **Running Folds:** The text mentions "Running Fold" in the context of Model 1's performance. This suggests the use of k-fold cross-validation, a common technique for evaluating model performance during training. 
* **Performance Metrics:** The text focuses on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and AUC Score. These are standard metrics used to assess model performance.

However, without further information, we cannot definitively say how these metrics were tracked and used to monitor performance during training.
