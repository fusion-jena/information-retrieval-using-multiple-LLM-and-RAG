The provided text does not describe the development or evaluation of a deep learning model. It focuses on a fuzzy inference system (FIS) called Apis-FIS for assessing bee suitability in different landscapes.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
