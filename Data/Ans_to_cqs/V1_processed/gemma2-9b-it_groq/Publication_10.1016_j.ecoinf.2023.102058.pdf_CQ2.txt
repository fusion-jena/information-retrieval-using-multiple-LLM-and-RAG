The provided text states that the study uses hyperspectral imagery.  Hyperspectral imagery is a type of multi-spectral imagery with a significantly higher number of narrow, contiguous spectral bands.  

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline likely uses image data in a specialized format that accommodates the numerous spectral bands of hyperspectral imagery.
