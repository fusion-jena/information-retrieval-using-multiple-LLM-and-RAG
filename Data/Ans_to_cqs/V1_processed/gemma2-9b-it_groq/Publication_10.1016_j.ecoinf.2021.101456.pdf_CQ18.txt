The provided text describes the model's architecture and training process but doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor performance during training. 

It does mention:

* **Reconstruction quality:** The authors aimed for "sufficiently good reconstructions" when expanding the dataset. This suggests they likely tracked reconstruction error as a performance metric.
* **Clustering performance:** The text refers to improvements in clustering performance with the addition of a specific loss term. This implies they evaluated clustering quality as a measure of model performance.

However, it doesn't detail how these metrics were calculated or visualized during training.
