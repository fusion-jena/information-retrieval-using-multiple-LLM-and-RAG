The provided text describes the data splitting process but doesn't explicitly state the specific criteria used for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets for the deep learning model. 

It does mention:

* **Training and Test Sets:** The authors used different percentages (40%, 50%, 60%, and 70%) of the initial observations for training and the remaining portion for testing. 
* **Performance Evaluation:** They evaluated the performance of the PBP method and compared it to other machine learning algorithms (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory) using accuracy, true-positive rates, and false-positive rates.

However, the text doesn't clarify if a separate validation set was used during the training process for hyperparameter tuning or model selection.
