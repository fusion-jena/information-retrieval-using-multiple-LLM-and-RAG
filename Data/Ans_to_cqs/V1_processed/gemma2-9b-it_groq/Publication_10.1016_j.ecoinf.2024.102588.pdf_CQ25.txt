The provided text states that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are "primarily used for image recognition and processing tasks". 

It goes on to list specific examples of these tasks:

* object detection
* image classification
* natural language processing 


Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model described in the text is **image recognition and processing**.
