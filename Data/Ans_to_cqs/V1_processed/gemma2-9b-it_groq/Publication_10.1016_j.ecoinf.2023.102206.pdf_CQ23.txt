The provided text focuses on the comparison of different Transfer Learning (TL) techniques (IFTL and FTL) and their application with various Transferable User Representations (TURs) like ELM, GRNN, and SVR. 

It doesn't explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  The text does discuss the importance of data distribution difference between source and target domains for evaluating TL performance. It states that benchmark datasets are partitioned into training (source) and testing (target) data, but it doesn't specify the techniques used for splitting the data (e.g., cross-validation, stratified splitting).
