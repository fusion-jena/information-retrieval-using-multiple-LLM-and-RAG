The provided text focuses on the LaDeco model's architecture, functionality, and references related to semantic segmentation and landscape analysis. It doesn't delve into the specifics of handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

To address your query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, here are some common techniques:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  Assigning a specific random seed value ensures that the random number generator starts from the same point each time you run your code. This makes your results reproducible.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Randomly applying transformations to your training data (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) introduces variations and helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  Normalizes the activations within each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.

Keep in mind that some randomness is inherent in deep learning, particularly during the weight initialization and optimization processes.
