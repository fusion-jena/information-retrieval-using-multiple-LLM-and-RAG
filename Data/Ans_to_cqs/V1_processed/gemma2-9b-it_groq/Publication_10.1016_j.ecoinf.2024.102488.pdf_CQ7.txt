The provided text focuses on feature selection and ensemble methods for classification, not deep learning model training.  It doesn't specify criteria for splitting data into train, test, and validation sets. 

Generally, in deep learning, data is split using the following:

* **Training set:**  The largest portion of the data, used to train the model's parameters.
* **Validation set:** A subset used to evaluate the model's performance during training and tune hyperparameters.
* **Test set:** Held out entirely from training and used only once at the end to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

The exact proportions of each split can vary, but common choices are 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
