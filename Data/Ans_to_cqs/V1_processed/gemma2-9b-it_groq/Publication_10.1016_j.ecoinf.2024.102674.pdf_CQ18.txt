The provided text describes the model evaluation strategy, not the monitoring strategy during training. 

The text states that the authors used cross-validation to assess model performance. It also mentions specific performance metrics like KGE, pbias, MAE, and RMSE. These metrics were calculated on separate datasets (weather station data, WorldClim, and CHELSA) to evaluate the models' ability to interpolate and downscale weather data.

However, the text does not explain how the models were monitored during training.
