The provided text states that the deep learning model is used for **sound identification**.  

While the text doesn't explicitly state if it's classification, segmentation, or detection, it describes the model's training process using spectrograms and mentions identifying the sounds of different species. This strongly suggests the model is designed for **sound classification**.
