The provided text mentions a "lightweight rice disease identification network based on attention mechanism and dynamic convolution".  

While it doesn't explicitly state the overarching deep learning model architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer), the keywords "attention mechanism" and "dynamic convolution" strongly suggest a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. 

CNNs are commonly used in image-based tasks like disease identification due to their ability to learn spatial features effectively through convolutional layers. Attention mechanisms are often incorporated into CNNs to focus on relevant parts of the input image, further enhancing performance.
