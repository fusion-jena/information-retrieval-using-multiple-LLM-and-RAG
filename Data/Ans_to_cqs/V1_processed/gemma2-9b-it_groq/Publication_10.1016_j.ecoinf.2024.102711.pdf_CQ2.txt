The provided text focuses on AutoML and doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention that AutoGluon is designed for structured data.  Structured data is typically represented in formats like:

* **CSV (Comma-Separated Values):**  A common format for tabular data.
* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**  A flexible format often used for exchanging data between applications.
* **Databases:**  Organized collections of data, often using structured query language (SQL).

The text also alludes to the use of images and potentially video in the context of fire behavior modeling, suggesting these formats might be involved. 


It's important to note that deep learning can handle various data types, including:

* **Images:**  Pixels arranged in a grid.
* **Audio:**  Sound waves represented as numerical data.
* **Video:**  A sequence of images.
* **Text:**  Sequences of words or characters.
