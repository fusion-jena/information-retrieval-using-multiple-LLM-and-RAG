The provided text describes the process of tuning the architecture of a deep learning model for forest damage segmentation. It details the various parameters tested, such as the number of layers, depth, layer rate, batch normalization, residual connections, and dropout. 

However, the text **does not** mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While it mentions using source images (Table 1), it doesn't elaborate on the diversity of these images in terms of forest types, damage types, or environmental conditions.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't describe any cross-validation techniques used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting of the dataset to ensure balanced representation of different classes (e.g., damaged vs. undamaged areas) in the training and validation sets. 


Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
