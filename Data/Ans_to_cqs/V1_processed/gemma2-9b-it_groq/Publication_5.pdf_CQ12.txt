The text states that the proposed models were based on the "most typical type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs".  It also mentions that "general image-based CNN architectures may not be appropriate for our data". 

While it doesn't explicitly state the specific type of neural network used, it implies a feedforward neural network  as the most likely choice given the description.
