The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the performance of the bird sound noise reduction network:

* **Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)**:  This metric quantifies the reduction in noise level relative to the original signal. 
* **Perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ)**: This metric assesses the subjective quality of the denoised audio, measuring how close it sounds to the original clean audio.
* **Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)**: This metric compares the original signal to the denoised signal in terms of the maximum peak difference. 


The text does not explicitly mention accuracy, precision, or recall.
