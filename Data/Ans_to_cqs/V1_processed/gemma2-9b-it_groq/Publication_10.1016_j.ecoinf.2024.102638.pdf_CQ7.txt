The provided text describes the data splitting process for machine learning models in general, not specifically for deep learning models. 

It states that the dataset is divided into:

* **Training set (80%):** Used to train the models.
* **Test set (20%):** Used to evaluate the final performance of the trained models.

The text also mentions **cross-validation** (specifically five-fold cross-validation) used during the hyperparameter tuning process within the training set.  

However, it doesn't explicitly mention a separate validation set often used in deep learning for further model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
