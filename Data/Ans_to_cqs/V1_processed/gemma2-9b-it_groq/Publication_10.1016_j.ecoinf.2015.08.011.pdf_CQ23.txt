The text describes the use of a few techniques to improve the model's generalizability:

* **Splitting the data:** The dataset was randomly split into 80% for training and 20% for validation. This separation allows the model to be evaluated on unseen data during training, helping to identify overfitting.

* **Early stopping:**  Training was stopped when the model's error on the validation set started to increase. This prevents the model from memorizing the training data and improves its ability to generalize to new data.

* **Trial-and-error method:** The authors used a trial-and-error approach to determine the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate. This involves testing different configurations and selecting the one that performs best on the validation set. 


The text does not mention the use of diverse datasets or stratified splitting.
