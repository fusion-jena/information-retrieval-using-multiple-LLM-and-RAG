The text states that the dataset used to train the model was created because of a lack of existing quality data. It also mentions that the dataset is "relatively small" in a deep learning context.  

The text does not mention any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While it mentions creating their own dataset, it doesn't describe the diversity of the data.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't mention cross-validation techniques.
* **Stratified splitting:** The text doesn't mention stratified splitting. 


Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
