The provided text focuses on techniques to prevent overfitting in a specific artificial neural network (ANN) model, not on strategies for handling randomness throughout the deep learning pipeline. 

While the text mentions random initialization of model weights and the random splitting of data into training and validation sets, it doesn't delve into broader strategies for managing randomness in deep learning. 

To address your query about randomness in the deep learning pipeline, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This ensures that the random number generator starts from the same point each time, leading to reproducible results. The text mentions random initialization but doesn't specify if a seed is used.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing samples.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  A technique that normalizes the activations of neurons within each mini-batch during training, reducing internal covariate shift and improving stability.
