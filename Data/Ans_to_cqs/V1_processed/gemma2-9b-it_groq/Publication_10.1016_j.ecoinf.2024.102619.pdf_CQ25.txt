The provided text focuses on the implementation details of a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model, particularly its use in image classification.  

While it doesn't explicitly state the overall purpose of the deep learning model, it strongly implies that the model is designed for **image classification**. 

Here's why:

* **VGG16 Network:** The text mentions using the VGG16 network, a pre-trained CNN architecture widely known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.
* **Feature Extraction:** The CNN is used to extract features from images, which are then used by an SVM (Support Vector Machine) for classification.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization for Classification:** The text discusses optimizing hyperparameters specifically for classification tasks.


Therefore, based on the context, the deep learning model's purpose is likely **image classification**.
