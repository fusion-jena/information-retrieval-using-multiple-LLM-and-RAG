The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for tree species diversity mapping using high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data.  

While it mentions the use of "field work" for collecting tree samples, it doesn't specify the exact methods used for data collection in the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your question based on the given context.
