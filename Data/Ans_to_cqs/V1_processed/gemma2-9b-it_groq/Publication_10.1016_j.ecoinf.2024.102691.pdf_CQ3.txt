The provided text focuses on the architecture and implementation of a depth-attention YOLOv5 model for object detection, particularly in the context of robotics and agriculture.  

While it describes the model's training process and incorporates techniques like segmentation and object extraction, it doesn't explicitly detail the specific data annotation techniques used to prepare the training dataset. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what data annotation techniques were employed (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation).
