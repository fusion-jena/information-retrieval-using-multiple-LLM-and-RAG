The text mentions the use of "stratified sampling" when dividing the datasets into training, validation, and testing sets.  

Stratified sampling ensures that the proportion of each class is maintained in each subset. This helps prevent overfitting to the majority classes and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. 

The text also describes the use of three separate datasets:

* **BC-S (BirdCLEF-Small):**  A subset of BirdCLEF2018 with smaller class sizes.
* **BC-L (BirdCLEF-Large):** A subset of BirdCLEF2018 with larger class sizes.
* **LS and LS*:**  Datasets derived from the Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata.

Using multiple datasets with varying class sizes and sources likely contributes to the model's generalizability by exposing it to a wider range of bird species and acoustic variations.
