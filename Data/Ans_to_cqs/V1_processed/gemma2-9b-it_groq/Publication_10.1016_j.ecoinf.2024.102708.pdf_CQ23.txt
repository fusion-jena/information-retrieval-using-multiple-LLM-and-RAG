The text mentions that the authors performed data augmentation on the training data, including varying lighting conditions. This was done to ensure the model could represent seasonal or daily variations in conditions. 

The authors also state that the work was carried out on "very different regions that are representative of many different environments across Europe." This suggests an attempt to capture diversity in the training data.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the model.
