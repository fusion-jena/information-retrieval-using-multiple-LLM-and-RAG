The provided text focuses on the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in LSTM models and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the broader deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common practice in deep learning to address randomness through techniques like:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:**  This ensures that the random number generator starts from the same point each time you run your code, leading to reproducible results. You'd typically set this seed at the beginning of your script using a line like `random.seed(42)`.

* **Using deterministic operations:**  Some deep learning libraries offer deterministic versions of operations that involve randomness (e.g., weight initialization). Using these can further reduce variability.

Keep in mind that some randomness is inherent to deep learning, particularly in:

* **Weight initialization:**  Randomly initializing weights is crucial for breaking symmetry and allowing the network to learn effectively.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" neurons during training, preventing overfitting.

* **Batch normalization:** This technique uses random mini-batches of data during training, introducing some stochasticity.
