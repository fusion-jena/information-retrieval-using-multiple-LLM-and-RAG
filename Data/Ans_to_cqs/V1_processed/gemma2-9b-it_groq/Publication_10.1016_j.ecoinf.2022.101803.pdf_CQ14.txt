The provided text describes the optimization of the regularization parameter λ using a grid search approach. 

Specifically, it states: "In the present work, we repeated the iterative optimization of the objective function in Eq. (16) for 100 discrete candidate values of λ chosen from a vector of equidistant values (Hastie et al., 2016), and then selected the value that minimizes the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) as an established model selection score." 


This indicates that a set of 100 evenly spaced values for λ were tested, and the value resulting in the lowest BIC was chosen as the optimal parameter.
