The provided text focuses on the history and development of neural networks, particularly deep learning, and doesn't specify the purpose of deep learning models. 

However, it does mention that deep learning algorithms are used to "obtain deeply hidden characteristic information and features." This suggests that deep learning models are likely used for tasks that involve complex pattern recognition and feature extraction. 

Common purposes of deep learning models include:

* **Classification:**  Categorizing data into predefined classes (e.g., identifying images of cats vs. dogs).
* **Segmentation:**  Dividing an image into distinct regions based on content (e.g., segmenting a medical image to identify tumors).
* **Detection:**  Locating specific objects or patterns within data (e.g., detecting faces in a crowd).
* **Generation:**  Creating new data similar to the training data (e.g., generating realistic images or text).


Without more specific information from the text, it's impossible to say for sure what purpose the deep learning model discussed is intended for.
