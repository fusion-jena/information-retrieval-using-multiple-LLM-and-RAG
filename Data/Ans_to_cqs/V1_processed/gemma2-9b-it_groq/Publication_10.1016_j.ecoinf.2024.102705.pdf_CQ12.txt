The provided text states that Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) are a classic deep learning model extensively utilized for image processing.  

It also mentions that DCNN can effectively extract ecological information from camera trap images. 


Therefore, it is highly likely that a DCNN is the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
