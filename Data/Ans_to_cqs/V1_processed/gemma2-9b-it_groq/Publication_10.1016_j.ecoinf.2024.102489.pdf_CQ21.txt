The provided text focuses on the model training process for predicting Leaf Area Index (LAI) using a Random Forest (RF) model.  It details the data preparation, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning techniques employed. 

However, the text does not describe any post-processing steps performed after model training, such as:

* **Saliency maps:**  These maps highlight the input features that contribute most to a specific prediction.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE are used to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Confusion matrix:** This matrix visualizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 


Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot answer what post-processing steps were involved.
