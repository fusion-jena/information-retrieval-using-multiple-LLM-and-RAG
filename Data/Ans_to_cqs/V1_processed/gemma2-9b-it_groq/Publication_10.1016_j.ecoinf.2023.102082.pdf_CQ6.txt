The provided text focuses on the use of GEDI and Sentinel-2 data for creating CHM (Canopy Height Model) and analyzing forest biodiversity. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization/Scaling:**  Scaling features to a similar range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance. Common techniques include min-max scaling and standardization.
* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy. This might involve combining features, extracting relevant information, or transforming data into a more suitable format.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:**  If the data contains categorical variables (e.g., species names), they need to be encoded into numerical representations that the model can understand. One-hot encoding is a common method.
* **Splitting Data:**  The dataset is typically split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model performance. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
