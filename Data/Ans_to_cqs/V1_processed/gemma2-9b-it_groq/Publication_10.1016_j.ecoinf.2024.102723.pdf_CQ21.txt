The provided text focuses on the model training process and evaluation metrics, particularly the Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculated through 10-fold cross-validation. 

It mentions using a 1000-run prediction process for each test point to account for the probabilistic nature of the models.  

However, the text does not describe any post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing feature importance.
* **Metrics calculation beyond MSE:**  Such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
* **Confusion matrix:**  Analyzing classification performance. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the specific post-processing steps used after model training.
