The provided text mentions the use of "batch updated stochastic gradient descent" as an optimization technique in the work by Barhate et al. (2023).  

It also states that the model in BarrÂ´e et al. (2017) employs "convolution features," which suggests the use of backpropagation, a common optimization algorithm in deep learning that relies on gradient descent. 

However, the text does not explicitly list other optimization techniques like Adam, RMSprop, or others that might be used in the cited studies.
