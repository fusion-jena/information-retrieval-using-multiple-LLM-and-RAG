The text describes several measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

* **Stratified splitting:** The dataset was randomly divided into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) sets in a stratified manner. This means the proportion of each landscape type was maintained across all three sets, preventing bias towards certain types during training. 

* **Diverse dataset:** While the text doesn't explicitly state the dataset's diversity, it mentions that ResNet50 outperformed other models despite the "challenge of manual sample distinction." This suggests the dataset likely contained a variety of landscape types, contributing to the model's ability to generalize. 


The text doesn't mention cross-validation techniques.
