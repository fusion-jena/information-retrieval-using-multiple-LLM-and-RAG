The provided text focuses on comparing different model architectures for image classification, particularly transformer-based models like ViT and Volo, and doesn't delve into specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. 

While the text mentions CutMix as a regularization strategy, it doesn't explain its mechanism in detail. 

Common regularization methods used in deep learning to combat overfitting include:

* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron and encourages the learning of more robust features.

* **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):** Adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This discourages the weights from becoming too large, effectively preventing overfitting.

* **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes the activations of each layer in the network, which can help stabilize training and reduce the risk of overfitting.

* **Early Stopping:** Monitors the model's performance on a validation set and stops training when performance on the validation set starts to decrease.
