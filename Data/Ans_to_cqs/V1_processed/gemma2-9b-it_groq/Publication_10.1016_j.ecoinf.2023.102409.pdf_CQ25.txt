Based on the provided text, the deep learning models (Unet, Pspnet, and DeepLabV3+) are used for **semantic segmentation**. 

The text states that these models are "increasingly applied to address geographical and ecological challenges" and that DeepLabV3+ "integrates an asymmetric spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) architecture within an encoder-decoder framework, effectively merging multi-scale information. This integration aids in precise object boundary detection". 

Semantic segmentation is a task where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific category.
