The provided text describes the training process and the data used, but it doesn't explicitly state the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. 

It does mention that an accuracy is generated for each algorithm applied during training, but it also notes that this accuracy is biased because it uses the same sample sets for both training and testing.  

Additionally, the text describes an additional accuracy assessment using validation points, but it doesn't clarify if this was done during the training process itself or after training was complete.
