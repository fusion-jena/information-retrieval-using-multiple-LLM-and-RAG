The provided text focuses on applications of deep learning in fish recognition and doesn't delve into specific strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common knowledge in the field of deep learning that randomness is inherent in several stages:

* **Initialization:**  Weights and biases in neural networks are often initialized randomly.

* **Activation Functions:** Some activation functions, like dropout, introduce randomness during training.
* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like random cropping, flipping, and color jittering add randomness to the training data.
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** This popular optimization algorithm uses random mini-batches of data to update model parameters.

To mitigate the impact of this randomness and ensure reproducibility, practitioners typically employ the following strategies:

* **Setting a Fixed Random Seed:**  By specifying a fixed seed value for the random number generator, you can ensure that the same random numbers are generated each time you run your code. This makes your experiments reproducible.
* **Using Techniques Like Weight Initialization:**  Specific weight initialization methods, like Xavier or He initialization, aim to reduce the impact of random initialization on model performance.
* **Careful Hyperparameter Tuning:**  The randomness introduced by techniques like dropout and batch size selection can be controlled through hyperparameter tuning.

Remember, a certain degree of randomness is often beneficial in deep learning, as it helps models generalize better and avoid overfitting.
