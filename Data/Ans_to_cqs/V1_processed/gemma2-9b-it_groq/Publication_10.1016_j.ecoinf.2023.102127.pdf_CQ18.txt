The provided text does not describe a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. 

It primarily focuses on the challenges of evaluating model performance in the context of species distribution modeling (SDM) when integrating multiple datasets and prior knowledge. 

The text mentions using metrics like True Skill Statistics (TSS) and various thresholding methods for evaluating the final model performance, but it doesn't delve into techniques used during the training process itself.
