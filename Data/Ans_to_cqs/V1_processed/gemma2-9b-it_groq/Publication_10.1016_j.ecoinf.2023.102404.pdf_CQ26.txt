The provided text focuses on the process of training a machine learning model for forest above-ground biomass estimation using LiDAR and Landsat data. It doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

While the text mentions stratified random sampling for data splitting, it primarily discusses its role in ensuring a representative training and testing dataset for model performance evaluation. 

Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are common methods for mitigating data bias in deep learning, but they are not addressed in this specific context.
