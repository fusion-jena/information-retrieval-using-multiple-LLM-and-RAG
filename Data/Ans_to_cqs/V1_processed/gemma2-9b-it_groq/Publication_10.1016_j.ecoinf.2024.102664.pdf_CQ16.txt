The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.  It mentions that the structure and hyperparameters of the model are determined by assessing the effectiveness of validation data forecasts.  

The text focuses on comparing the performance of different solvers (Adam, sgdm, RMSProp) and input time series lengths (3 days, 7 days) using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) on the validation data.  

It concludes that Adam generally yields lower RMSE values, leading to its selection as the solver. However, it doesn't elaborate on how long the training process continues or what specific metrics trigger the completion of training.
