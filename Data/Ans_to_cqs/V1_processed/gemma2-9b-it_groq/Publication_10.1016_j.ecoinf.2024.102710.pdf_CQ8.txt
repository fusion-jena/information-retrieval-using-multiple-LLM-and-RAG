The provided text mentions several code repositories:

*  https://github.com/HKathman/pam_annotation_experiments
*  https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer/tree/main/checkpoints/V2.4
*  https://tfhub.dev/google/vggish/1
*  https://tfhub.dev/google/yamnet/1 

It also mentions using  `tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16(weights=’imagenet’).` and `tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet_v2.ResNet152V2(weights=’imagenet’).` which are likely available through TensorFlow's official repositories.

However, the text does not explicitly state where the complete deep learning pipeline's code is hosted.
