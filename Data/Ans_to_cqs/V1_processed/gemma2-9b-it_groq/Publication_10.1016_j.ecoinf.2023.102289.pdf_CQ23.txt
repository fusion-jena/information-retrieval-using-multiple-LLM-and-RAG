The provided text describes the LaDeco platform and its functionality but doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. 

It mentions the use of the ADE20K dataset, which contains 150 indoor and outdoor objects, including 55 outdoor visual landscape elements. This suggests that the dataset used for training the model likely included diverse landscape scenes. 

However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed during the model development process.
