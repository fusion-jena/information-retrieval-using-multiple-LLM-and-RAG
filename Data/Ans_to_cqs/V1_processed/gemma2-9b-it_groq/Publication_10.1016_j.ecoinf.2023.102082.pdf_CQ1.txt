The provided text mentions the use of Sentinel-2 optical images and GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) data in a deep learning pipeline for creating a high-resolution CHM (canopy height model) of the Earth. 

Therefore, the raw data collection methods used in this specific deep learning pipeline are:

* **Satellite imagery:** Sentinel-2 provides optical imagery.
* **LiDAR data:** GEDI is a LiDAR mission that measures vegetation structure.
