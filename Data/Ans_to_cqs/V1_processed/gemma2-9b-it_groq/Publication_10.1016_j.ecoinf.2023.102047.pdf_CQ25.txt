The provided text describes a deep learning model used for **object detection**. 

Several clues point to this:

*  The text mentions "Faster R-CNN" and "EfficientDet", which are popular object detection algorithms.
*  It talks about "predicting candidate bounding boxes" and "refining bounding boxes", which are key tasks in object detection.
*  The model is trained on an image dataset and its performance is evaluated based on metrics like mIoU (mean Intersection over Union), precision, recall, and accuracy, which are commonly used for object detection tasks.
