The provided text focuses on a deep learning model for fish biomass estimation and doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting raw data in the pipeline. 

However, based on the context, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Underwater Stereo Images:** The paper mentions using "underwater stereo images" for fish detection and biomass estimation. This suggests that cameras are likely used to capture these images.
* **Sensors:** While not specified, the research could involve additional sensors to collect data like fish movement, water conditions, or environmental factors that might be used to refine the model.
* **Public Datasets:** It's possible the researchers utilized existing public datasets of fish images for training and validating their model.


Without further information from the source, we can't definitively state the exact methods used for data collection.
