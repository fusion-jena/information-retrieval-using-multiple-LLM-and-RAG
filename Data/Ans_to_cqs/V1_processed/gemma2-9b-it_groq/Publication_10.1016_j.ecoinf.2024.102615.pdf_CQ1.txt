The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in analyzing spectral reflectance data, particularly for soil properties and water quality. It doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting the raw data itself. 

However, based on the context, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Sensors:** The mention of "spectral reflectance data" strongly suggests the use of sensors capable of capturing electromagnetic radiation reflected from the target (soil or water).  
* **Remote Sensing:**  References to Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Gaofen-2 images indicate the potential use of satellite imagery as a source of raw data.
* **Public Datasets:** The text cites research papers that likely utilize publicly available datasets containing spectral reflectance information.


Without further information from the provided context, it's impossible to definitively state the exact methods used for data collection.
