The provided text describes the use of k-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal training-test split for a deep learning model. 

Specifically, the data was split into 5 different training-test sets (k=5). The model was trained on each of these training splits and evaluated on the corresponding test split.  

The split that resulted in the highest mAP50 (mean Average Precision at 50% recall) value was selected as the ideal split. mAP50 is a metric used to evaluate the performance of object detection models, indicating the percentage of correctly predicted labels. 


The text doesn't explicitly state the criteria used for the initial partitioning of the data into the 5 folds.
