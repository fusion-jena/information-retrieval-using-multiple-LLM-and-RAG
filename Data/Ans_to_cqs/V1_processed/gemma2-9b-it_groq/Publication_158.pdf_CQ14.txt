The hyperparameters for the Random Forest model were optimized using a two-step process. 

First, a random search was conducted with 100 sampled parameter sets.  The search space included parameters like the number of trees, minimum samples split, minimum samples per leaf, maximum depth, bootstrap, and maximum features for split.  Three-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of each sampled set.

Second, a grid search was employed to refine the best performing parameters found in the random search. The grid search focused on the number of estimators (±50) and adjusted the other parameters by ±1.
