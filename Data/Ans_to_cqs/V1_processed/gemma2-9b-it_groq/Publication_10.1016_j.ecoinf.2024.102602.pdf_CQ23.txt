The text describes the use of 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the models and guide hyperparameter tuning.  

Here's what that means for generalizability:

* **Dataset Splitting:** The dataset was divided into five subsets.
* **Iterative Training and Validation:** In each iteration of the 5-fold cross-validation, one subset was held out for evaluation, while the remaining four were used for training and validation. 

This process ensures that the model is tested on different portions of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting (performing well on the training data but poorly on unseen data). 

The text does not mention other techniques like stratified splitting or the specific diversity of the dataset.
