The provided text does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions using machine learning (ML) algorithms like RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, but these are not deep learning models.  Deep learning models typically involve artificial neural networks with multiple layers, such as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers.
