The provided text states that the performance of the deep learning model, Kaleidoscope, is evaluated using two metrics: 

* **Recall rate:** This is calculated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by Kaleidoscope by the total number of cow calls present in the sound recordings. It represents the percentage of cow calls that the model is able to detect.

* **Precision:** This is calculated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by Kaleidoscope by the total number of ROIs (regions of interest) within the "Cow" cluster. It represents the percentage of ROIs correctly labeled as cow calls by the model.
