The provided text focuses on the architecture and loss functions of a specific deep learning model and doesn't discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

To address your query about handling randomness, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the same random numbers are generated in each run, making the results reproducible.

* **Using deterministic algorithms:** Some algorithms, like certain matrix operations, have deterministic implementations, eliminating randomness within those parts of the pipeline.
* **Dropout regularization:** While introducing randomness during training, dropout helps prevent overfitting and can be seen as a strategy for managing the impact of random initialization.
* **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes activations within each mini-batch, reducing the sensitivity to variations in input data and internal covariate shift, which can be influenced by randomness.
