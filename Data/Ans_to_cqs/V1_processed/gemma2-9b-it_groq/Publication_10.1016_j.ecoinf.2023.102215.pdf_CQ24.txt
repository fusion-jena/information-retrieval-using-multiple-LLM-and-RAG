The provided text focuses on the U2-Net model for salient object detection and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.  

To address your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  A random seed is a starting point for the random number generator. By setting a fixed seed, you ensure that the same "random" values are generated each time you run your code. This is crucial for reproducibility.

* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like random cropping, flipping, rotation, and color adjustments introduce controlled randomness during training. This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step prevents overfitting. This adds an element of randomness to the network's structure.

* **Batch Normalization:**  This technique normalizes the activations within each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing training. While not directly related to random number generation, it helps mitigate the impact of randomness in the data.
