The provided text focuses on the performance improvement achieved by incorporating a  CAM (Class Activation Mapping) module into a residual network for object classification.  

While it mentions that the CA-Hybrid network achieves the best results and highlights a positive correlation between image size and classification performance, it doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:**  Visualizing which parts of the input image are most influential for the model's decision.
* **Metrics calculation:**  Quantifying the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* **Confusion matrix:**  A table showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what post-processing steps are involved after model training.
