The text describes the dataset being split into training, validation, and test sets. It also mentions that the training set was balanced by upsampling images from underrepresented classes.  

However, it doesn't explicitly state whether techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were used during the data splitting process.  It does mention that the images were captured in close proximity and potentially have overlapping fields of view, raising concerns about information leakage between the sets.  

Therefore, we can't definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model beyond confirming the training set was balanced.
