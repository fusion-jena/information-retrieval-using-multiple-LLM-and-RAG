The provided text focuses on the training process of a deep learning model, particularly ResNet-50, and doesn't specify the exact metrics used to evaluate its performance. 

However, it does mention the concept of "loss score" which is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual labels.  

Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include:

* **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified images.
* **Precision:**  The proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all cases predicted as positive.
* **Recall:** The proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all actual positive cases. 


To get a definitive answer on the specific metrics used in this context, you would need to refer to the complete documentation or research paper associated with the model's development and evaluation.
