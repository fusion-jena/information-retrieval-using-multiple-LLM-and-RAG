The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in bioacoustic classification, particularly for marine mammals. While it mentions the need for significant sample sizes and tools to enhance data, it doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:**  Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for deep learning models.

* **Splitting Data:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets is crucial for evaluating model performance.


For a comprehensive understanding of preprocessing techniques specific to deep learning, you would need to consult resources dedicated to machine learning and deep learning methodologies.
