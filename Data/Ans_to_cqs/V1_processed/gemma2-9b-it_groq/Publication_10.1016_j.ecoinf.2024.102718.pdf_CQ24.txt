The provided text focuses on the performance of a specific deep learning model (BEiT) for plant disease classification and doesn't delve into strategies for handling randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it's common practice in deep learning to address randomness through techniques like:

* **Setting a fixed random seed:** This ensures that the initialization of weights and other random processes are reproducible. Different runs with the same seed will produce identical results.

* **Data augmentation:**  Randomly applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to training data introduces variations and helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch normalization:**  Normalizes the activations within each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and stabilizing training.
