The provided text focuses on the model selection process for classifying rural landscapes using deep learning.  It mentions using CNN architectures like VGG, Inception, and ResNet but doesn't delve into specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what regularization methods were employed.
