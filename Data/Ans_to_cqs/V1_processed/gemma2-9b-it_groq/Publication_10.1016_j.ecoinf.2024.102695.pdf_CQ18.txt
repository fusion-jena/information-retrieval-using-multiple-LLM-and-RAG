The provided text describes the dataset split and hardware used, but it doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention:

* **Early stopping:** This technique is used to prevent overfitting by stopping training when the performance on the validation set starts to decrease. 

Without further information, we can't say for sure what other metrics were used to monitor performance.
