The provided text focuses on the implementation and advantages of the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model for nearshore bathymetry studies. It describes the model's training process using the 'sklearn' library in Python and mentions fine-tuning parameters like 'n_estimators'. 

However, the text doesn't delve into post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction.  Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context.
