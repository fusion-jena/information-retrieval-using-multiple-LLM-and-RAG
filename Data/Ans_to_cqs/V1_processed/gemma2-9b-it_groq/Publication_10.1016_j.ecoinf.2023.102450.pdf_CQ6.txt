The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning for animal tracking and species identification in wildlife videos. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models in general. 

However, common preprocessing steps for training deep learning models typically include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Removing irrelevant information, such as noise, duplicates, or corrupted data points.
* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model training stability and convergence.
* **Data Augmentation:** Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, cropping, and color adjustments.
* **Feature Extraction:**  Transforming raw data into a more suitable format for the model. This might involve extracting specific features relevant to the task, such as edges, textures, or shapes. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
