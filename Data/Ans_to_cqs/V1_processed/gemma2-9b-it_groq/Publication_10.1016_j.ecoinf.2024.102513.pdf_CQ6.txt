The provided text focuses on the architecture and function of convolutional neural networks for land use/land cover (LULC) classification. It doesn't describe the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of features to prevent certain features from dominating the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Data:**  Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.
