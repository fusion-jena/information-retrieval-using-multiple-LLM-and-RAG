The provided text focuses on using deep learning models for *feature extraction and classification* of gibbon vocalizations. 

The goal is to use these embeddings for *individual acoustic discrimination* of gibbons,  meaning identifying individual gibbons based on their unique vocalizations. This could then be used for *sustained and non-invasive monitoring of animal populations*.
