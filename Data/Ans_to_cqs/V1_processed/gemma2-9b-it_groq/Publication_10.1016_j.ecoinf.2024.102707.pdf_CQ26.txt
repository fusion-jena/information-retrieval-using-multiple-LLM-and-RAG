The provided text focuses on the methodology of a study using a deep learning model for object detection in drone imagery. It describes the dataset, model architecture (YOLOv6), and experimental setup but doesn't delve into specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
