The text states that the model's performance was monitored using both **loss** and **accuracy** metrics. 

Specifically:

* **Loss:** Figure 9 shows the training and validation loss over 100 epochs. This helps to identify if the model is overfitting (where validation loss increases while training loss decreases) or underfitting (where both training and validation loss are high).
* **Accuracy:** Figure 10 displays the training and validation accuracy over 100 epochs. This metric indicates how well the model is classifying the bird species. 


The authors observed that the model achieved convergence early in training but continued to show decreasing loss throughout the 100 epochs. This suggests effective training and regularization.
