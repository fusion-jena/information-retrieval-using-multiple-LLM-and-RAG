The provided text states that the labeled dataset was split into three parts:

* **Training dataset (70%):** This portion of the data is used to train the deep learning model. 
* **Validation dataset (50% of the training data):** This subset is used during the model selection and parameter optimization phases. It helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data from the training set.
* **Testing dataset (30%):** This portion is held out entirely from the training and validation processes. It is used only once at the end to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance on data it has never encountered before.
