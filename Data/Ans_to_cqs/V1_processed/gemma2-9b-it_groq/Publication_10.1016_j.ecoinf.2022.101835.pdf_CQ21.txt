The provided text describes several post-processing steps taken after training the machine learning models:

1. **Performance Evaluation:** The performance of the models was evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). These metrics quantify the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.

2. **SHAP Value Analysis:**  SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were calculated to understand the contribution of each input variable to the model's predictions. The average absolute SHAP values for each input variable were computed to determine their overall importance.

3. **Prediction Generation:**  The optimized models were used to predict the first flowering and full blossom dates for each station and year.

4. **RMSE Calculation:** The root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated for all observation sites to evaluate the overall performance of the models. Additionally, the RMSE was calculated for each observation site individually to assess the performance for each specific location. 


The text does not mention saliency maps or confusion matrices as post-processing steps.
