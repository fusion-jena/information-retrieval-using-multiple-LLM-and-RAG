The provided text focuses on the challenges and considerations related to training deep learning models for remote sensing data, particularly concerning data processing and classification accuracy. 

While it mentions feature optimization tools and the use of ESP evaluation tools for segmentation, it doesn't explicitly state the specific deep learning model used in the study or its precise purpose. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively answer what the purpose of the deep learning model is.
