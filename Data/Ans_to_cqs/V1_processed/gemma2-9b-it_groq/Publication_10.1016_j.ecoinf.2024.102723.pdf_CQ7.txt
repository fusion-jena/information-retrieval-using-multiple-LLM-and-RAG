The provided text does not specify the exact criteria used to split the data into training, test, and validation sets. 

It does mention that a 10-fold cross-validation was performed to estimate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set and to determine the dropout rate for the MCD approach.  It also states that both the training and validation subsets were used in this 10-fold cross-validation. 


However, it doesn't explain how the initial data was divided into training, validation, and test sets.
