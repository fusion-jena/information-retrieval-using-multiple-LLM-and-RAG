The provided text mentions that the environmental data and air pollution data are of the Big Data type and are in the order of terabytes in size. It also states that the study uses deep learning algorithms for early diagnosis of COVID-19 affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images. 

Therefore, we can infer that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include:

* **Image:** X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. 


It's possible that other data formats are used, but the text does not explicitly mention them.
