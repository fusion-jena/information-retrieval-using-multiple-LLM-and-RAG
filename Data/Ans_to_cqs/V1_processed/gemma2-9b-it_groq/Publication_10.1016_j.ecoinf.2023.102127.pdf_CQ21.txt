The provided text focuses on model training and integration within a package, but it doesn't delve into specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. 

It does mention that after training, the resulting fit can be "visually interrogated, summarized, and validated" (Fig. 1). This suggests some form of model evaluation and visualization is possible, but the exact methods aren't detailed.
