The provided text focuses on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and specifically discusses regularization techniques used within that framework.  It mentions  "β-annealing" and cyclic β as methods to address instability in balancing the reconstruction and regularization losses within a VAE. 

However, the text does not discuss general regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
