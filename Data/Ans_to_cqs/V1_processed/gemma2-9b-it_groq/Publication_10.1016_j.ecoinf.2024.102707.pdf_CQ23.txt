The provided text describes the model's performance but doesn't specify the exact techniques used to ensure its generalizability.  

It mentions:

* **Training and validation data:** The model was trained on training data and evaluated on validation data, suggesting some form of data splitting.
* **Test-over_time and test-over_location:**  The model's performance was assessed on data from different times and locations, indicating an attempt to evaluate its ability to generalize to unseen scenarios.

However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset were employed.
