While the provided context focuses on topics like smart farming, remote sensing, and NASA web services, it doesn't delve into the specifics of deep learning preprocessing. 

However, I can tell you about common preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model performance. Common methods include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

* **Feature Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, this adjusts the scale of features to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Converting categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) into numerical representations that models can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations like rotations, flips, or crops to existing data points (especially useful for image data). 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the nature of your data and the deep learning model you're using.
