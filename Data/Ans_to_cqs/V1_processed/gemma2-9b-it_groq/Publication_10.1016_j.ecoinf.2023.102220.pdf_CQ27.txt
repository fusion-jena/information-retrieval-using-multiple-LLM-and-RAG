The provided text describes the development and evaluation of different machine learning models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, but it doesn't specify the exact process followed for deploying the trained models.  

The text mentions that the implementation of the classification methods was carried out in Python using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries. This suggests that the models were likely saved in a format compatible with these libraries, which could involve model serialization techniques. However, details about the specific platform or environment where the trained models were deployed are not provided.
