The provided text describes the model development process but doesn't explicitly mention specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

The text does state that the model was tested in Northeast China in 2023, indicating an attempt to evaluate its performance on data from a different location and time.  Additionally, the model's performance was compared to a model that didn't consider crop coverage differences, suggesting some effort to assess its robustness to variations in input data. 


However, without further information, it's impossible to definitively say what specific measures were taken to ensure generalizability.
