The provided text focuses on a specific deep learning model (YAMNet) and its application in goat vocalization detection. It details the preprocessing steps involved in preparing audio data for this particular model, which include:

1. **Mono Channel Conversion:** Converting the audio to a single channel.
2. **Resampling:** Resampling the audio to a fixed rate of 16 kHz.
3. **Spectrogram Extraction:** Creating a spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitudes with 25 ms windows and 15 ms overlaps.
4. **Mel Spectrogram Calculation:** Transforming the spectrogram into a Mel spectrogram using 64 bins within the 125-7500 Hz range.

However, the text doesn't explicitly mention general preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are commonly applied to data before training deep learning models.
