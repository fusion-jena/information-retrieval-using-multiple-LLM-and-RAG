The provided text focuses on the performance and methodology of a deep learning model for tree species diversity mapping.  It mentions the use of a three-step workflow and high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. 

However, it doesn't explicitly state the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While it mentions the importance of diverse tree samples, it doesn't detail the dataset's composition or how diversity was ensured.
* **Cross-validation:**  The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting for data partitioning. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
