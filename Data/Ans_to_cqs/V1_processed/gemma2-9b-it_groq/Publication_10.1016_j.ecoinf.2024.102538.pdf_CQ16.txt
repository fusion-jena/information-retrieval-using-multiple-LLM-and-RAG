The provided text states that the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 0.1 whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs.  It also mentions that the minimum learning rate was set at 1 Ã— 10<sup>-5</sup>. 

Therefore, training was likely considered complete when the validation loss plateaued for five consecutive epochs, and the learning rate had been reduced to the minimum value.
