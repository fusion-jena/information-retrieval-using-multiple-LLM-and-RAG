The provided text focuses on the application of hyperspectral data and machine learning for water quality prediction. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing outliers, and addressing inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Scaling:**  Similar to normalization, but often involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature. This helps features with different scales contribute equally.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations that deep learning models can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
