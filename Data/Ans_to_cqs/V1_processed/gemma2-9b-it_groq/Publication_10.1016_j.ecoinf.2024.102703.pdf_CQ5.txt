The provided text describes the development of a neural network model for predicting the Trophic State Index (TSI) using  aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) as input features. 

It does not mention any standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. 


The text states that 64 water samples were used for model calibration and the remaining for validation.  It's likely the dataset used consists of  measurements of aCDOM(254), Fn(355), and TSI for these water samples.
