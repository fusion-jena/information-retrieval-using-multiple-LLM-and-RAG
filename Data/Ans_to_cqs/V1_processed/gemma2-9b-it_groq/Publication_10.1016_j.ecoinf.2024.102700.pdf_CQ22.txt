The provided text focuses on model validation metrics used in studies related to cetaceans and sea turtles, not specifically deep learning models.  

While it mentions metrics like accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC, it doesn't delve into the specifics of how these are applied to deep learning models. 

To get information about deep learning model evaluation metrics, you'd need to consult resources specific to deep learning.
