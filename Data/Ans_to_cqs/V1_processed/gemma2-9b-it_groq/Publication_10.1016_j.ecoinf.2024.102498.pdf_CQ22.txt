The provided text mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for land use and land cover (LULC) classification:

* **Accuracy:**  This metric represents the overall correctness of the model's predictions. 
* **Precision:**  Precision measures the proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.
* **Recall:** Recall shows the proportion of truly positive cases that the model correctly identified.
* **F1 Score:** This metric is the geometric mean of precision and recall, providing a more balanced evaluation, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. 


The text also describes metrics used to evaluate the model's performance in simulating meteorological parameters:

* **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
* **Bias**
