The provided text focuses on data scaling in the context of environmental remote sensing and ecological informatics. It describes techniques for scaling spatial and temporal data within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. 

While the text mentions data scaling as a crucial preprocessing step, it doesn't delve into other common preprocessing steps used before training deep learning models, such as normalization, cleaning, or feature engineering. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.
