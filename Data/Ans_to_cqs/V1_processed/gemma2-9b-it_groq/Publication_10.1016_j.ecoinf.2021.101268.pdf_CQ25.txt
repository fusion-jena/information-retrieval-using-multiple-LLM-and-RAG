The purpose of the deep learning model described in the text is **classification**. 

The model is trained to identify ten different species of leaves from images.  The text states that the "fully connected block is adjusted to feed off the feature vector and output the ten species of leaves." This indicates that the model takes an image as input, extracts features using a pre-trained deep learning architecture, and then classifies the image into one of the ten leaf species categories.
