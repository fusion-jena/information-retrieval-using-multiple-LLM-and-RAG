The deep learning model in FIREMAP is used for **classification**. 

It takes as input atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 post-fire Level-2A scenes and classifies the region of interest into different burn severity categories. This is achieved by training the model on a large dataset of pre-classified post-fire scenes.
