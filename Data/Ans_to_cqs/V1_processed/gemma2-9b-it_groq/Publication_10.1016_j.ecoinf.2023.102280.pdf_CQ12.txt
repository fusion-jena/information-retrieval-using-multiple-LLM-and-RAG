The provided text mentions that deep noise reduction methods often use a U-net architecture.  It also states that transformer attention mechanisms have been successfully applied. 

Therefore, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are likely a combination of:

* **U-Net:**  For the core noise reduction task.
* **Transformer:**  Likely incorporated for attention mechanisms to enhance the model's ability to process sequential audio data.
