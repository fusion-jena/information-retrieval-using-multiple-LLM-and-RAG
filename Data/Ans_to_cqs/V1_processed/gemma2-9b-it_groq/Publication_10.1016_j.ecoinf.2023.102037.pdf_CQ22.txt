The provided text states that the model performance was evaluated using standard metrics common in object detection datasets like MS COCO. 

Specifically, the metrics mentioned are:

* **Precision:** Measures the fraction of correctly detected target insects out of all detected objects.
* **Recall:** Measures the fraction of correctly detected target insects out of all actual target insects in an image.
* **Precision-Recall (PR) curve:**  A curve that plots precision against recall at various threshold settings.
* **Average Precision (AP):** The area under the PR curve for a given Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold.
* **mAP (mean Average Precision):** The mean AP across all insect classes in the dataset.
