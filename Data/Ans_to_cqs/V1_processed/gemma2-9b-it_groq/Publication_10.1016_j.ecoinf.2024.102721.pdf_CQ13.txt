The provided text focuses on describing the LSTM model and Bayesian optimization but doesn't specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.  

It mentions that Bayesian optimization is used to tune a "large number of hyperparameters" to achieve optimal model architecture, but it doesn't list those specific hyperparameters.
