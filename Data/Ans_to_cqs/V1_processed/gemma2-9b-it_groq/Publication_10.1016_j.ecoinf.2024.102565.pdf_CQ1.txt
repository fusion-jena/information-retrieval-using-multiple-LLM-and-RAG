The provided text focuses on the application of machine learning, specifically neural networks, for analyzing satellite imagery to determine chlorophyll-a concentrations and total suspended matter. It doesn't delve into the specific methods used for collecting the raw data itself. 

However, based on the context, we can infer that the raw data likely comes from:

* **Satellite Imagery:** The papers repeatedly mention Landsat 8 data and other satellite ocean color data. This suggests that satellite imagery is a primary source of the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline.

To get a more complete answer about the data collection methods, you would need to consult sources that discuss the specific datasets used in these studies or explore broader literature on remote sensing and environmental data collection.
