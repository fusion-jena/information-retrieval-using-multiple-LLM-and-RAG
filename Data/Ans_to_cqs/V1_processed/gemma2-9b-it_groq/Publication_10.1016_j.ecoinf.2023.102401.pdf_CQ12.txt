The provided text describes a feature fusion network called CRFPN, which incorporates an attention mechanism.  

While it mentions using a backbone network, it doesn't specify the exact type of deep learning model used as the backbone.  Therefore, we cannot determine if it's a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or another type of model based on the given information.
