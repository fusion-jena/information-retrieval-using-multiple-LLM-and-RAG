The provided text focuses on a marine species monitoring app and doesn't contain information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.  

To answer your query about preprocessing steps for deep learning, here are some common ones:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.

* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) or min-max scaling can be used to ensure features have similar scales.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:**  Converting categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories) into numerical representations that models can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations like rotations, flips, or crops (especially useful for image data).
