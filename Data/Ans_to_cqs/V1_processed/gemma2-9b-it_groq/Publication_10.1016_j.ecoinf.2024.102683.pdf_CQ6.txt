The provided text focuses on data augmentation techniques and the use of attention mechanisms in deep learning models for plant identification. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. 

However, common preprocessing steps generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.
* **Feature Scaling:** Techniques like standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) can help features with different scales contribute equally to the model.
* **Encoding Categorical Data:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) is necessary for most deep learning algorithms.
