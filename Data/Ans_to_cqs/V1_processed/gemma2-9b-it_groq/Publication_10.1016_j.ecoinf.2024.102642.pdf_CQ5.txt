The text mentions two main datasets used in the deep learning pipeline:

1. **SWAMS dataset:** This dataset consists of 7 hours of audio recordings of SEIO PBW vocalizations collected in the Indian Ocean. It includes 102 manually annotated vocalizations.

2. **Datasets containing other SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whaleâ€™s Dcall:**  These datasets are not named specifically but are used to evaluate the performance of the CNNs trained on different annotation sets.  


The text does not provide information about other datasets used in the pipeline.
