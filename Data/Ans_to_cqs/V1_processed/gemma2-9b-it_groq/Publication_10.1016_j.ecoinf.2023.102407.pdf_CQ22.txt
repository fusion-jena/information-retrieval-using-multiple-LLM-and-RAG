The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) rather than deep learning models in general. 

The text mentions four metrics used to evaluate SDMs:

* **Sensitivity:**  
* **Specificity:** 
* **True Skill Statistic (TSS):** 
* **Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC):** 


It does not list metrics commonly used for deep learning models like accuracy, precision, or recall.
