The provided text describes the data splitting process but doesn't explicitly state the criteria used. 

Here's what we can infer:

* **Purposeful Splitting:** The text mentions that the data is split "purposefully" for training and validation, suggesting that the criteria are chosen to optimize model performance.
* **Computational Efficiency:**  The text highlights the computational cost of processing entire recordings. This implies that the split might consider the size and duration of the recordings to manage computational resources.
* **Cropping Methods:** Two different cropping methods are used for training and validation recordings, likely to ensure diverse and representative samples for each set.

However, the specific criteria for determining the size of each split (e.g., percentage-based division) or the exact rules for applying the cropping methods are not detailed in the given context.
