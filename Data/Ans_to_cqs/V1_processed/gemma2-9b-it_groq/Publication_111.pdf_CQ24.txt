The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH). It doesn't delve into specific strategies used to handle randomness within the deep learning pipeline. 

To address randomness in deep learning, techniques like setting a random seed for the initial weights and using dropout regularization are commonly employed.
