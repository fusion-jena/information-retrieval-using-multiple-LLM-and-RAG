The provided text focuses on a study using machine learning for predicting Short-billed Gull habitat and doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (imputation or removal), removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into features that are more relevant for the model. This can involve creating new features, encoding categorical variables, or scaling numerical features.
* **Normalization/Scaling:**  Scaling numerical features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process. Common techniques include min-max scaling and standardization.
* **One-Hot Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into a binary representation (vectors of 0s and 1s) that deep learning models can understand.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the data and the chosen deep learning model.
