The provided text focuses on the technical details of implementing a CNN model for analyzing audio data, particularly bird calls.  

While it describes the model's architecture and training process, it doesn't explicitly state the ultimate purpose of the deep learning model. 

Based on the context, it's highly likely the purpose is **classification**.  

The text mentions:

*  Training data preprocessing involves segmenting audio into fixed-size windows.
*  The model uses a pre-trained ResNet50, originally designed for image classification.
*  The authors discuss using fully connected layers for learning a predictive model from the extracted features.

These elements strongly suggest the model is trained to classify audio segments (bird calls) into different categories (bird species).
