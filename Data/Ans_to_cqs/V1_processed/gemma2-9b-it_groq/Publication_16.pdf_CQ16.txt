The text states that the model's accuracy flattens towards the end of the training session. It also mentions that increasing the number of epochs beyond the point of convergence would likely lead to overfitting.  Therefore, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is likely a combination of:

* **Accuracy plateau:** When the model's accuracy on the validation set stops improving significantly.
* **Risk of overfitting:**  Monitoring the validation loss and accuracy for signs of overfitting (where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data).
