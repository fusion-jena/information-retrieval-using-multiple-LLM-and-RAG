The text states that the performance of the models was evaluated using three standard metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (r2).  

It also mentions that the grid search focused on minimizing the MSE to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters.  

While the text describes the metrics used for *evaluating* performance, it doesn't explicitly state the strategy used to *monitor* performance *during* training.
