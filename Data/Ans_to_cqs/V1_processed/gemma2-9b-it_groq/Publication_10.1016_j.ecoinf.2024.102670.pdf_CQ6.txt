The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in image analysis, particularly in the field of biological imaging. It doesn't delve into the specific preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
* **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve model performance.
* **Scaling:** Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the range of features to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
* **Feature Engineering:**  Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance model accuracy.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing images. 


Remember that the specific preprocessing steps will vary depending on the nature of the data and the deep learning model being used.
