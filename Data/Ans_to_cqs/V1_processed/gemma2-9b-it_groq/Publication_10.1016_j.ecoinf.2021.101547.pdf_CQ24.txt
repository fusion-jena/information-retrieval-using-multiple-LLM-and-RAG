The provided text focuses on the specifics of training a CNN for polar bear detection and doesn't delve into general strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it does mention a few instances of randomness:

* **Random image cropping:** Both background images and polar bear images are randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels.
* **Random mini-batch selection:**  The text states that images are selected randomly for each mini-batch.

These examples suggest that the authors are aware of the need to introduce randomness during training to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. 

To address the broader query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, one would need to look beyond this specific context.  Common strategies include:

* **Setting a random seed:** This ensures that the same "random" numbers are generated each time a model is trained, allowing for reproducibility.
* **Data augmentation:** Techniques like random cropping, flipping, and color adjustments introduce variations in the training data, further mitigating overfitting.
* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly "drops out" (ignores) a percentage of neurons during each training step, preventing the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron.
