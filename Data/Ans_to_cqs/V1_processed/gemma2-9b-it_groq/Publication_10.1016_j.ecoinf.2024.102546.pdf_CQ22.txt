The provided text focuses on the challenges of evaluating domain shifts in image generation and weed detection, but it doesn't explicitly list the specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning models' performance. 

However, it does mention:

* **Image fidelity and reality:** These are evaluated using current metrics, but the text suggests they might not be sufficient for assessing domain gaps.
* **Human evaluation protocol:** This involves side-by-side image comparison to distinguish synthetic images and could be used to measure domain gaps.
* **Weed detection accuracies:**  The text refers to accuracies of YOLOX and YOLOv8 models with and without domain adaptation, suggesting accuracy is a key metric.

Therefore, while the exact metrics aren't stated, **accuracy** is likely one of them, and **other standard metrics like precision and recall** could also be used for evaluating the weed detection models.
