The provided text states that the trained ANN was a multilayer perceptron (MLP).  

While MLPs are a type of artificial neural network, they are not typically categorized as "deep learning" models in the same way CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers are. 

Deep learning models usually refer to neural networks with many hidden layers (hence "deep"). The text mentions a single hidden layer in the MLP, so it wouldn't be classified as a deep learning model according to common usage.
