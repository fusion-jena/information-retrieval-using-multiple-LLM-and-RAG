The provided text describes the following preprocessing steps applied to the images before training:

1. **Random Horizontal Flipping:** Images are randomly flipped horizontally to increase the dataset's diversity and prevent overfitting.

2. **Contrast Scaling:** The contrast of each image channel is scaled randomly by a factor between 0.8 and 1.2. This introduces variations in image brightness and helps the network learn more robust features.

3. **Random Cropping:** Images are randomly cropped to a square with side lengths equal to the image height. This introduces variations in the region of interest and encourages the network to learn features that are invariant to position.

4. **Data Balancing:** The training set is balanced by upsampling images from underrepresented classes to match the number of images in the most represented class ("No species"). This ensures that all classes are represented equally during training. 



The text does not mention other common preprocessing steps like normalization or scaling.
