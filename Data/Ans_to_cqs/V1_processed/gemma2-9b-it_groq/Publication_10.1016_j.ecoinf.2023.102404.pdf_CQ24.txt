The provided text focuses on parameter tuning for a random forest model, not deep learning.  It describes strategies for handling randomness in the context of this specific model, such as:

* **Using a seed value:**  A random seed is used to ensure reproducibility of results. Different seeds will lead to different random splits of the data and different tree constructions.

The text does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
