The text states that the researchers used data augmentation with the fastai `get_transforms` function to help generalize the model.  Specifically, they used the following arguments:

* `flip_vert = TRUE`: Allowed for vertical flipping of images.
* `max_lighting = 0.02`: Limited overly exposing the images.
* `max_zoom = 1`: Disabled the zooming augmentation.
* `to_fp16 = TRUE`: Reduced the memory load on the GPU. 

The text also mentions an 80-20% split for training and validation datasets, respectively.  However, it does not mention  diverse dataset creation or cross-validation techniques.
