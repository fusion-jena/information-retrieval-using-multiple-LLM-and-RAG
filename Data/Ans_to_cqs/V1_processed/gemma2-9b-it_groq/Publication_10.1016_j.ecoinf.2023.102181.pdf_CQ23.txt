The provided text focuses on covariance-weighted bagging, a technique used to improve the performance and reduce bias in machine learning models, particularly when dealing with clustered data. It does not discuss the training or evaluation of a deep learning model.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model based on this text.
