While the provided text discusses various applications of remote sensing and machine learning in agriculture, it doesn't explicitly detail the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on the context, we can infer some possibilities:

* **Satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2):**  Several papers mention using satellite data, particularly Sentinel-2, for tasks like vegetation analysis and crop identification. 
* **Hyperspectral imaging:** The text references hyperspectral imaging technology for agricultural applications, suggesting its potential use as a data source.
* **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) imagery:**  A study on vegetation extraction and fractional vegetation cover in Karst areas uses UAV-based visible light images.
* **Public datasets:**  The text doesn't specify the origin of all the datasets used in the cited studies, but it's likely that some are publicly available.


To get a definitive answer on the specific data collection methods used in a particular deep learning pipeline, you would need to consult the original research papers or documentation for that specific project.
