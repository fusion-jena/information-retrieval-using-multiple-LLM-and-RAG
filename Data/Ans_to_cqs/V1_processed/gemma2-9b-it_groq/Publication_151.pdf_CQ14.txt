The text states that in extensive simulations, hyperparameters like k and training parameters were set to preselected values and not fine-tuned. 

However, it suggests that for real-world applications, hyperparameters could be fine-tuned using a validation set.  The process involves:

1. Randomly selecting a subset of the reference species as the validation set.
2. Using this subset to test and tune the parameters for the given dataset.
3. Finally, training the model one last time with all the data and the fine-tuned parameters.

The text does not specify the exact optimization method used for fine-tuning (e.g., grid search, random search).
