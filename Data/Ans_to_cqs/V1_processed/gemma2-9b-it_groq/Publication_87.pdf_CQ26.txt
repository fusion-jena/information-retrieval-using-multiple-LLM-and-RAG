The provided text focuses on using deep learning for ecological research, particularly species identification and occupancy modeling. It doesn't delve into specific techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

However, based on general knowledge of machine learning, here are some common techniques used to address data bias:

* **Stratified Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets while proportionally maintaining the class distribution present in the original data. This helps ensure that the model doesn't become biased towards the majority class.
* **Oversampling:** Increasing the representation of minority classes by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples.
* **Undersampling:** Reducing the representation of majority classes by randomly removing samples.
* **Diverse Data Collection:**  Actively seeking out and including data from a wide range of sources and representing different subgroups to minimize biases introduced by limited or skewed data collection.
