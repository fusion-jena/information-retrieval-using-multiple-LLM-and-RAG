The provided text describes a deep learning pipeline for analyzing marine images but does not specify the exact names of the datasets used (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet). 

It does mention:

* **Manual annotations:** These were used to create training, validation, and testing datasets.
* **Biigle annotations:** These were likely used as a source of labeled data, providing information like label names, center coordinates, etc. 


The text focuses on the pipeline's implementation details and performance rather than the specific datasets employed.
