The text states that the performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and average precision (AP) at various Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds. 

Specifically, AP0.5, which is the average precision at 50% IoU, was used as a measure of the global detection performance of the model.
