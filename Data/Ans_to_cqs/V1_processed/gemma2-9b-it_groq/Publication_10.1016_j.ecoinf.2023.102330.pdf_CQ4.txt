The provided text describes a data augmentation technique called "adding known 'non-detections' with distance of NA to our dataset".  

This involves artificially introducing instances where a call is not present (non-detections) into the dataset.  Each observation is then labeled with a variable `zi,j` indicating whether it's a true call or a non-detection. 

The text doesn't mention other common data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
