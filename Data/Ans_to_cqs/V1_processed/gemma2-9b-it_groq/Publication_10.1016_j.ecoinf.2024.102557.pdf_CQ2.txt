Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. 

However, the text mentions applications of deep learning in ecology, including:

* **Image-based species identification** (Voces et al., 2018)

This suggests that **image data** is likely used as input for deep learning models in this context. 


It's possible that other data formats, such as **CSV** (for ecological data), could also be used depending on the specific application.
