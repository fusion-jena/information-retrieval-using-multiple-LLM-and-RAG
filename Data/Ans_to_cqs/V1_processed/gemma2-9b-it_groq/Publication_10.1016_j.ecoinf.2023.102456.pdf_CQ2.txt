The provided text focuses on a specific application of deep learning in modeling forest fire behavior using cellular automata. It doesn't explicitly mention the data formats used in the broader deep learning pipeline. 

However, we can infer some possibilities based on the context:

* **Spatial Data:** The text refers to "spatial inputs" like "masks of states" with dimensions 257x257x9. This suggests the use of grid-based spatial data, potentially representing a map or image of the forest environment.

* **Numerical Data:**  The text discusses machine learning algorithms like backpropagation, which typically work with numerical data. This could include data on factors influencing forest fires, such as weather patterns, vegetation density, or historical fire records.


Without further information from the source material, it's impossible to definitively list all data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
