The provided text does not specify the exact optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for modeling SOCS (Soil Organic Carbon Stock).  

While it mentions the use of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm, a type of feedforward artificial neural network, it doesn't delve into the specific optimization algorithms employed to train this MLP. 

Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants (like Adam, RMSprop), but without further information from the study, we cannot confirm which one(s) were used.
