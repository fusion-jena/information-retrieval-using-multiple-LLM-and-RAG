The provided text describes a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting for model training, but it doesn't specify the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (train, test, validation). 


It mentions 100 different splits were created for each setting, and hyperparameter tuning was done on the training set for each split.  Optimal hyperparameters were then used for model training. However, it doesn't detail the specific proportions allocated to the training, validation, and test sets.
