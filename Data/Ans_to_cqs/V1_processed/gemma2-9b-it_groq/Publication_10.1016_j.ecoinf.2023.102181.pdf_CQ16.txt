The provided text focuses on describing different validation techniques used in machine learning, particularly in the context of spatial data. It doesn't discuss criteria for determining when training is complete. 

Common criteria for determining training completion include:

* **Validation loss plateau:**  If the performance on a validation set (separate from the training data) stops improving or starts increasing, it might indicate overfitting.
* **Maximum number of epochs:** Setting a limit on the number of times the model sees the entire training dataset can prevent overtraining.
* **Early stopping:**  This technique monitors the validation loss and stops training if it doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs.
