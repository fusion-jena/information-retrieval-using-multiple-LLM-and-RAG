The provided text states that the preprocessed data was divided into three sets:

* **Training set (80%):** Used to train the deep learning models.
* **Validation set (10%):** Used to tune the hyperparameters of the models.
* **Test set (10%):** Used to evaluate the final performance of the trained models on unseen data. 


This 80-10-10 split was chosen to ensure a more extensive training set, potentially leading to a better-generalized model.
