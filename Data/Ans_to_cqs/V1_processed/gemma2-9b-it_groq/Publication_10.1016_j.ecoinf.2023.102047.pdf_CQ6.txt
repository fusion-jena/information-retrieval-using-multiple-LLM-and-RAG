The provided text focuses on object detection algorithms and weight fusion techniques in deep learning models, and doesn't delve into specific preprocessing steps. 

However, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model generally include:

* **Data Cleaning:** This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) can improve model training stability and performance.

* **Standardization:**  Centering data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature. This helps ensure features have zero mean and unit variance.

* **Encoding Categorical Features:** Converting categorical variables (e.g., text labels) into numerical representations that the model can understand (e.g., one-hot encoding).

* **Image Preprocessing:** For image data, this might involve resizing, cropping, color space transformations, and augmentations (e.g., rotations, flips) to increase dataset diversity.
