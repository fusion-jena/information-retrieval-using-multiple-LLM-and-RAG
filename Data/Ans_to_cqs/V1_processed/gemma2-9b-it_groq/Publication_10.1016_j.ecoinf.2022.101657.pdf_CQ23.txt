The provided text describes the training process of a deep learning model for species identification using camera trap images.  

It mentions that the model was initially pre-trained on the MS-COCO dataset and then fine-tuned using the WCS dataset.  

However, the text **does not specify** the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. 

It does not mention:

*  Details about the diversity of the WCS dataset (e.g., geographical coverage, species representation).
*  The use of cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
*  The use of stratified splitting to ensure balanced class representation during training and testing. 


Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
