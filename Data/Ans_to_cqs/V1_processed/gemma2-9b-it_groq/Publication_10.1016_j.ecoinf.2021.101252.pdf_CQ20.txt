The text states: "To face this challenge, ecologists will likely have to move in the same direction as their fellow computer scientists and embrace faster hardware (e.g. GPUs, ‘tensor processing units’ and large-resourced cloud computing services) and scalable model implementations (e.g. distributed computing)." 

Therefore, the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include:

* **GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)**
* **TPUs (Tensor Processing Units)**
* **Large-resourced cloud computing services**
