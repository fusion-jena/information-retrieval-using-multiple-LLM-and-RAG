The provided text focuses on preprocessing for traditional machine learning models, not deep learning.  It describes min-max scaling to normalize features to a range of [0,1]. 

While min-max scaling is sometimes used in deep learning, the specific preprocessing steps can vary greatly depending on the model architecture, dataset, and task. 

Common preprocessing steps for deep learning include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance.
* **Standardization:** Similar to normalization, but scales features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
* **One-hot encoding:** Converting categorical features into a binary representation.
* **Data augmentation:** Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying transformations like rotations, flips, and crops.
* **Handling missing values:** Imputing missing values with mean, median, or other techniques.
* **Feature engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. 


It's important to experiment with different preprocessing techniques to find what works best for a particular deep learning model and dataset.
