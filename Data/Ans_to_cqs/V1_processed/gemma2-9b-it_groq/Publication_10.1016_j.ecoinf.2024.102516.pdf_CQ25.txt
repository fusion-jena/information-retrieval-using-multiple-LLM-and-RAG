The deep learning model described in the text is primarily used for **semantic segmentation**. 

The text explains that the model is trained in three phases:

1. **Classification:** The initial phase trains the network to identify specific plant species within an image.
2. **Weak Segmentation:**  The trained classification network uses class activation mapping (CAM) to generate "weak segmentation maps" that roughly outline the location of the plant in the image.
3. **Segmentation:** These weak segmentation maps are then used to train a dedicated segmentation network, which learns to precisely delineate the boundaries of plants within images. 


Therefore, while the model starts with a classification task, its ultimate goal is to achieve accurate semantic segmentation of plants in images.
