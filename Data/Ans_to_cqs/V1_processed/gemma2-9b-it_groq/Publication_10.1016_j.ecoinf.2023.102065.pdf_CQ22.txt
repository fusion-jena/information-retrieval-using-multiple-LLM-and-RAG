The provided text mentions the following metrics for evaluating the deep learning models:

* **Total Precision:**  This metric measures the proportion of correctly identified positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive. 
* **Total Recall:** This metric measures the proportion of correctly identified positive instances out of all actual positive instances. 
* **Accuracy:** While not explicitly defined in the excerpt, accuracy is a common metric in machine learning and typically refers to the overall correctness of predictions (correctly classified instances divided by the total number of instances). 


The text focuses on comparing the performance of different CNN models (CNN-XC) against a baseline model called BirdNET, using precision-recall curves and average precision at various probability thresholds.
