The provided text focuses on evaluating the performance of various machine learning models (RFs, GBMs, GAMs, and ANNs) for temperature prediction.  It specifically mentions the following metrics:

* **Percent Bias (pbias):**  Measures the tendency of the model to under or overestimate temperatures. Positive values indicate underestimation, while negative values indicate overestimation.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**  Calculates the average absolute difference between observed and predicted temperatures.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**  Measures the square root of the average squared difference between observed and predicted temperatures. 

The text does not mention traditional deep learning metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
