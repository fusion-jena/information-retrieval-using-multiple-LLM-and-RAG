The provided text focuses on using deep learning to predict wildfire events.  

While it doesn't explicitly state the specific type of deep learning model used (classification, segmentation, detection), the context suggests it's likely a **classification** model. 

Here's why:

* **Prediction:** The researchers aim to predict wildfire events, which is a binary classification problem (will there be a wildfire or not).
* **Historical Data Analysis:** They analyze historical environmental conditions before and after wildfires, implying they are trying to learn patterns to distinguish between wildfire and non-wildfire situations.
* **Probability:** The text mentions "wildfire occurrence probabilities" and "Bayes factors," which are common outputs of classification models.


Therefore, based on the context, it's reasonable to infer that the deep learning model is likely a **classification** model designed to predict the likelihood of a wildfire event.
