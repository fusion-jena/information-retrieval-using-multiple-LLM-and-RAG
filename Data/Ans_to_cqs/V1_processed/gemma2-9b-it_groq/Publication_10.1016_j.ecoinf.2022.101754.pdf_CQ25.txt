The provided text focuses on using machine learning models to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) from LiDAR and Landsat imagery.  

While it mentions a deep learning model ("Deep learning based retrieval of forest aboveground biomass"), it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of that model. 

Based on the context, it's highly likely the deep learning model is also used for **regression**, aiming to predict the AGB values from the combined LiDAR and Landsat data, similar to the other machine learning methods (AdaBoost, Random Forest, Bayesian Ridge Regression) described in the text.
