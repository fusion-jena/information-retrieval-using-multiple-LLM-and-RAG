The provided text focuses on the architecture of a deep learning model and doesn't describe the criteria used for data splitting. 

To answer your query, here are common criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation:

* **Percentage Split:** The most common method is to divide the data into three sets:
    * **Training set:**  Typically the largest portion (e.g., 70-80%) used to train the model.
    * **Validation set:** A smaller portion (e.g., 10-15%) used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during training.
    * **Test set:** Held out entirely from training and used only once at the end to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

* **Time-Based Split:** For time-series data, the data might be split based on chronological order, with earlier data used for training and later data for testing.

* **Stratified Split:**  If the data has imbalanced classes, stratified sampling ensures that each class is proportionally represented in each split.

The specific split proportions and method chosen depend on the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the goals of the project.
