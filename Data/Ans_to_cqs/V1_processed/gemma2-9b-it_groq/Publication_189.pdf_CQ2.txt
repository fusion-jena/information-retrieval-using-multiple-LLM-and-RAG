Based on the provided text, the deep learning pipeline uses **image** data. 

There are references to:

* Image shape: "[a,640,640,3]" and "[a,640,640,1]" are mentioned, indicating images with dimensions 640x640 pixels and 3 or 1 color channels respectively.
* Training images and true masked images: This suggests the use of labeled images for training.
* Mask R-CNN: This is a deep learning model specifically designed for object detection and instance segmentation in images.
