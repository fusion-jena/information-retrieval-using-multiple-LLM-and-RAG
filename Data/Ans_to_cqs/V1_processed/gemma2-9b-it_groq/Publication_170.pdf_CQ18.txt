The model performance was monitored by tracking the **loss rate** during training. 

The training process terminated when the loss rate fell below a predefined threshold, denoted as  ɛ (1.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup> in this case). This threshold served as the criterion for determining when the model had converged sufficiently and training could be stopped.
