The provided text mentions data preprocessing as a necessary step before data analysis in a smart farming system. It lists several data preprocessing features:

* **Data deduplication:** Eliminating excessive copies of data.
* **Data cleansing:** Removing incorrect, corrupted, or incomplete data.
* **Data transformation:** Changing the structure or format of data.
* **Data compression:** Modifying or converting the bits structure of data.

While the text doesn't explicitly detail preprocessing steps for deep learning models like normalization or scaling, these are common practices. 

**Normalization and scaling** are techniques used to standardize the range of input features, which can improve the performance and stability of deep learning models. 

**Data cleansing** is crucial for deep learning as it removes noise and inconsistencies that can negatively impact model training. 


Therefore,  data cleansing, along with normalization and scaling, are likely preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in a smart farming system.
