The provided text doesn't describe the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.  It doesn't mention things like:

* **Dataset diversity:**  Whether the dataset included a wide range of animal species, environments, and lighting conditions.
* **Cross-validation:**  Techniques used to split the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  Methods for ensuring that the different classes (animal types) are proportionally represented in each data split. 


Therefore, based on the information given, we can't say for sure what steps were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
