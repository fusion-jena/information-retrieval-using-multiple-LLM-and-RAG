The provided text discusses the use of deep learning models, particularly in the context of camera trap data analysis.  

While it mentions various deep learning techniques like Mask R-CNN and Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation, it doesn't explicitly state the overarching purpose of the deep learning model used in the research. 

However, based on the context, we can infer that the primary purpose is likely **object detection**. 

Here's why:

* The text talks about reducing the amount of "useless data" collected by camera traps, suggesting a focus on identifying and classifying relevant objects (animals) within the images.
*  The mention of "per-camera object detection" and "instance segmentation of animal species" further points towards object detection as the core function.


Therefore, while the exact model architecture and specific tasks aren't fully detailed, object detection seems to be the primary goal of the deep learning model discussed in the text.
