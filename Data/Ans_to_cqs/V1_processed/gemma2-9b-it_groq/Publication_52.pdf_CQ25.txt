The provided text describes a deep learning model designed for **classification**. 

Specifically, it aims to classify objects as either "native" or "invasive" based on their location and acoustic features.  The model uses a combination of  Online Sequential Multi-layer algorithm and a Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder (MIGRATE_ELM) to achieve this classification.
