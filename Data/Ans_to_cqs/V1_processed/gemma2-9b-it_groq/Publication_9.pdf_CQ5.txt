The provided text mentions ImageNet as a dataset used for training deep learning models. 

Specifically, it states: "Using pre-trained CNNs out-of-the-box is constrained by how relevant the novel input data are to the data the CNN was originally trained on. For instance, ImageNet comprises more than 14 million high-resolution images across nearly 22,000 categories and is often used as a starting point for recognition tasks with deep learning (Deng et al., 2009; Krizhevsky et al., 2017)." 


It also mentions MNIST and CIFAR as examples of datasets used for training deep learning models.
