This study uses a hybrid hyperparameter optimization scheme (HHOS) that combines manual search and random search. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Manual Search:** Experts first identify frequently used hyperparameter configurations that have shown effectiveness in similar studies. This step aims to reduce the search space and leverage existing knowledge.

2. **Random Search:**  Random search is then applied to the narrowed-down hyperparameter space. It randomly samples various combinations of hyperparameters, trains the models with each set, and evaluates their performance. The configuration yielding the highest accuracy is selected as the optimal set. 


Essentially, HHOS leverages the expertise of manual search to guide the random search, making the process more efficient than a purely random approach.
