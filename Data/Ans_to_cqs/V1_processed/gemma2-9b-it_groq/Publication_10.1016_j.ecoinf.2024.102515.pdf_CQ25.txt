The provided text doesn't explicitly state the purpose of a potential deep learning model. 

It does mention that training a deep learning model for image recognition would be "very useful" if the methodology were extended to larger areas and/or more languages. This suggests that the purpose of such a model would likely be related to **image analysis and classification** within the context of biodiversity observations.
