The provided text does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the CNN-LSTM model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. 

It only mentions that the model's hyperparameters were not adjusted after embedding the LSTM into the CNN, and that this change led to a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy.
