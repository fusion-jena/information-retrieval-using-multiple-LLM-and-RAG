The text states that "Firstly, we generated a training dataset by selecting 500 of the survey images at random to be used exclusively for training."  

It also mentions "Images were tiled into 864 Ã— 864 subimages and then passed though a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset provided by (Redmon & Farhadi, 2018)."


Therefore, the deep learning pipeline uses **image** data.
