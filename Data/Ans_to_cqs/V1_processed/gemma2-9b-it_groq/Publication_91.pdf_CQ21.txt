The provided text focuses on the training process of a model, mentioning the batch size, learning rate decay, and the context of the model's application (pollen and pollinator species identification). 

However, it doesn't specify the post-processing steps involved after training.  

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about the specific post-processing steps like saliency maps, metric calculation, or confusion matrix from this context.
