The provided text focuses on the CNN model architecture, training process, and accuracy evaluation.  It mentions the use of a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance (see Figure 4b). 

However, the text doesn't explicitly detail other post-processing steps like:

* **Saliency maps:** These are used to visualize which parts of the input image the model focuses on when making a prediction.
* **Specific metric calculations:** While accuracy is mentioned, the text doesn't list other common metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we can only confirm the use of a confusion matrix for evaluation. Information about other post-processing steps like saliency maps and detailed metric calculations is not available in the text.
