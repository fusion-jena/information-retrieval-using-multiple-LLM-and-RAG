The provided text does not specify the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for fish grading.  While it mentions using six organoleptic parameters to automatically classify fish freshness, it doesn't detail how these parameters were translated into a format suitable for deep learning. 

To determine the specific annotation techniques, you would need to consult the full research paper by Jayasundara et al. (2023).
