The provided text does not specify the exact data annotation techniques used for the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset. 

While it mentions the dataset includes "raw" and "segmented" images, it doesn't elaborate on the methods used to create these segments.  

Therefore, we cannot determine if techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were employed.
