The provided text does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.  It only mentions the model architectures (YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, and their variants) and evaluates their performance using metrics like F-score, precision, recall, etc. 

To find the specific hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, etc.), you would need to refer to the full research paper or the code repository associated with this study.
