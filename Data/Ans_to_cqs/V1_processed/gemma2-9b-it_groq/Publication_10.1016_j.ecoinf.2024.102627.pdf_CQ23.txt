The provided text describes the model's training process and architecture but doesn't specify the exact measures taken to ensure its generalizability.  

It mentions using a "presence-only" dataset and training a deep species distribution model. It also states that the model is calibrated to return species assemblages with high confidence for initially observed species. 

However, details about data splitting techniques (like cross-validation or stratified splitting), the diversity of the dataset, or any specific steps taken to prevent overfitting are not provided in the given context.
