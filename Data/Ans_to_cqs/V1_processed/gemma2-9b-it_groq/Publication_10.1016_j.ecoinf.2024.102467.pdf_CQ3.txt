The provided text states that the AUDD dataset uses annotation files in the MS-COCO format.  It also mentions that these files need to be converted into a usable text format for ground truth bounding box annotation files. 

Therefore, we can infer that **bounding box annotation** is used in the deep learning pipeline. 


The text does not provide information about other data annotation techniques like instance segmentation.
