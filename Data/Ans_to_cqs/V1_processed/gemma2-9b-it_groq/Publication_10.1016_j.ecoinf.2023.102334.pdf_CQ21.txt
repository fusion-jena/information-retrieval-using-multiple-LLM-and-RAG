The provided text describes the model training process and its performance evaluation but doesn't explicitly list post-processing steps beyond the confusion matrix. 

Here's what we can infer:

* **Confusion Matrix:** As mentioned, the confusion matrix was used to analyze the model's performance on each category, calculating accuracy, precision, and other metrics. This is a standard post-processing step for classification tasks.

* **Metrics Calculation:**  The text states that the confusion matrix was used to calculate various evaluation indicators. These likely include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and potentially others depending on the specific problem.

* **Potential for Other Steps:** While not explicitly mentioned, common post-processing steps in computer vision tasks could include:
    * **Saliency Maps:**  Visualizing which parts of the input image the model focused on for making its prediction.
    * **Thresholding:** Adjusting the model's output probabilities to create binary classifications (e.g., deer present or absent).
    * **Visualization:** Displaying the results, such as bounding boxes around detected deer in images.



It's important to note that the absence of explicit mention doesn't rule out the use of these other post-processing steps.
