The provided text focuses on the implementation of an LSTM model for air quality prediction and doesn't delve into specific data bias mitigation techniques used during preprocessing. 

While it mentions preprocessing with MinMaxScaler to scale features to a [0-1] range, it doesn't discuss strategies like:

* **Stratified splitting:**  Ensuring class distribution is maintained in training and testing sets.
* **Oversampling:**  Increasing the representation of minority classes.
* **Undersampling:**  Reducing the representation of majority classes.
* **Diverse data collection:**  Actively gathering data from various sources and demographics to reduce representation biases. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
