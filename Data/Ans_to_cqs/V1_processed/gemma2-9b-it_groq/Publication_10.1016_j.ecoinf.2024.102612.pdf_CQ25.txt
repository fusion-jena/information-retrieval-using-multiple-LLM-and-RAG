The provided text states that a deep learning (DL) model is used for **semantic segmentation**. 

This is mentioned in Section 2.4, which discusses using a generator to create synthetic data for training. The text says: "Once the generator presented in Section 2.2 can create synthetic MS [multispectral] point clouds, semantic segmentation with a DNN model is performed." 

Semantic segmentation is a type of image analysis where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific category.
