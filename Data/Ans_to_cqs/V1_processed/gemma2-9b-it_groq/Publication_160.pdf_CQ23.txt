The provided text focuses on the impact of different patch sizes on the performance of ResNet architectures. It mentions that a patch size of 224x224 yielded the highest micro-F1 on the test set, suggesting better generalization compared to smaller patch sizes. 

However, the text doesn't explicitly describe other measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While the text mentions the Moorea dataset, it doesn't elaborate on its diversity.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't mention any cross-validation techniques used.
* **Stratified splitting:**  The text doesn't discuss how the dataset was split into training and testing sets. 


Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken beyond using a larger patch size to improve the model's generalizability.
