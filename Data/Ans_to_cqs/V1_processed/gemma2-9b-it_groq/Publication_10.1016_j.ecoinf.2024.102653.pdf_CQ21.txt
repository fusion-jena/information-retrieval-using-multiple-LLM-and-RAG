The provided text describes the model training process and hyperparameters used but doesn't explicitly detail the post-processing steps performed after training. 

However, it does mention the following:

* **Metrics calculation:**  The text states that "conventional metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance," listing metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve. This implies that these metrics were calculated after training to assess the model's effectiveness.
* **Confusion matrix:** The text defines the confusion matrix as one of the metrics used for evaluation. This suggests that a confusion matrix was generated post-training to analyze the model's classification performance. 


The text doesn't mention saliency maps or any other specific post-processing techniques.
