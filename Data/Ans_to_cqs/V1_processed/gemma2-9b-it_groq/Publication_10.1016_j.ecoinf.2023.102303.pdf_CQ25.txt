The purpose of the deep learning models described in the text is **fish detection** in turbid waters. 


The text states that the goal is to "enhance the capability of marine scientists in turbid underwater and coastal environment monitoring" and that two novel deep learning networks are developed to achieve this.  It further mentions using the networks for "fish detection in turbid waters."
