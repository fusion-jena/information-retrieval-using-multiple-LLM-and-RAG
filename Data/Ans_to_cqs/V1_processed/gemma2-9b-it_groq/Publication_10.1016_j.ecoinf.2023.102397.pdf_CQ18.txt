The provided text doesn't explicitly describe the strategy used to monitor model performance during training. 

It does mention:

*  The use of  "quality measures" and "results" to evaluate the performance of the recognizer.
*  The selection of the optimal cut-off thresholds based on F-scores, precision, and recall.
*  The use of a random forest model on a test set to further evaluate the recognizer's performance.

However, it doesn't detail how these metrics were tracked and used to guide the training process.
