The provided text focuses on the model architecture, training process, and performance metrics. It doesn't explicitly describe post-processing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrix calculation, or detailed metric computation. 

While it mentions metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, model size, and analysis time, it doesn't explain how these are calculated or visualized. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide information about specific post-processing steps.
