The provided text focuses on the LSTM model's implementation for air quality prediction and doesn't specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. 

However, it mentions:

* **"temporal window"**: This suggests the data likely has a time series structure, possibly in a format like CSV where each row represents a data point at a specific time.
* **"features"**:  This implies the data contains multiple variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, pollutant concentrations) that are used as input to the model.

Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that the data format is likely a structured format like **CSV**, containing time-series data with multiple features.
