While the provided text focuses on metadata for image datasets, it doesn't specify preprocessing steps for deep learning models. 

However, common preprocessing steps for training deep learning models generally include:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1 or -1 to 1) to improve model stability and convergence.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset by applying transformations like rotations, flips, crops, and color adjustments. This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant information from the images. This might involve techniques like removing background clutter, correcting lens distortions, or filling in missing pixels.

* **Resizing:**  Adjusting image dimensions to a consistent size required by the deep learning model.

The specific preprocessing steps will depend on the nature of the dataset, the deep learning model architecture, and the specific task.
