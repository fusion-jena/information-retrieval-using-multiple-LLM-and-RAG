The provided text focuses on groundwater salinity modeling and doesn't contain information about deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in machine learning pipelines.  

To answer your query about randomness in deep learning, here are some common strategies:

* **Setting a Random Seed:**  This initializes the random number generator, ensuring that the same "random" values are produced every time you run your code. This is crucial for reproducibility.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data points. This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

* **Dropout:**  Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during each training step. This prevents overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.

* **Batch Normalization:**  Normalizing the activations of each layer during training, reducing the internal covariate shift and stabilizing learning.

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  An optimization algorithm that uses a random subset (batch) of the training data to update the model's weights in each iteration. This introduces randomness and helps escape local minima.
