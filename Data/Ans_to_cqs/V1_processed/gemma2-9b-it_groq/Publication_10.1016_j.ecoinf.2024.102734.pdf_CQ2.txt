The provided text mentions the use of spectrograms and 1-D waveforms as input data for the deep learning models. 

Therefore, the data formats used in the pipeline are:

* **Spectrograms:** These are visual representations of audio signals, often used as input for audio classification tasks. They can be considered image-like data.
* **1-D Waveforms:** These represent the raw audio signal as a series of amplitude values over time.
