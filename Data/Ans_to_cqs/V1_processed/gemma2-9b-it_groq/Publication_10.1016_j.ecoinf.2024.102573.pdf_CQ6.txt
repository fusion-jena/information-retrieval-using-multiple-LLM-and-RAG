Based on the provided text, here are the preprocessing steps mentioned before training a deep learning model:

* **Log Compression:**  The text describes using log compression on spectrograms, likely to compress the dynamic range of the audio data.
* **Normalization:**  The text highlights the significant improvement in performance when applying normalization *after* log compression. This normalization is applied to the backend's input, which is the output of the frontend.
* **PCEN (Perceptual Contrast Enhancement Network):** This technique is presented as an alternative to log compression and normalization. It whitens the data by Gaussianizing magnitudes and decorrelating frequency bands, effectively suppressing stationary background noise.

The text doesn't explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps like scaling, cleaning (removing noise or outliers), or feature engineering.
