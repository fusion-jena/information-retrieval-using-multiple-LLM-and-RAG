The provided text describes the implementation of a deep neural network (IUC-NN) for predicting the conservation status of orchids. It mentions that the data was randomly split into training, validation, and test sets.  

The text also states that cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation set five times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. This technique helps to mitigate the impact of randomness in data splitting.

However, the text does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in other aspects of the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value for reproducibility.
