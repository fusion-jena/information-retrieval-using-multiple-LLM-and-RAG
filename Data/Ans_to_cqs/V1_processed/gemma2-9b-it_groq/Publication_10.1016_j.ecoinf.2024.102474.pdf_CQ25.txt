The provided text focuses on the implementation details and context of the deep learning models used in the study, but it doesn't explicitly state the specific purpose of the models. 

However, based on the title "Enhanced prediction of vegetation responses to extreme drought using deep learning and Earth observation data," and the mention of  "vegetation health and land surface dynamics forecasting," we can infer that the purpose of the deep learning models is **prediction**. 

More specifically, they are likely used to predict how vegetation will respond to extreme drought conditions.
