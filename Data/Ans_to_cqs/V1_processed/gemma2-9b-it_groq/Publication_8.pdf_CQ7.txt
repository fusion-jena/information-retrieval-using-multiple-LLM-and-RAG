The provided text describes the training process of a deep learning model for identifying plant organs in digitized herbarium scans.  

It states that the model was trained twice:

1. **First Training:**
    *  A subset of 498 images was used for training on a single GPU for 9000 iterations.
    *  Performance was evaluated on a separate test subset of 155 images, also on a single GPU.

2. **Second Training:**
    *  All 653 annotated images were used for training on three GPUs for 18000 iterations.
    *  This training aimed to predict plant organs on a different, un-annotated dataset.

The text **does not explicitly mention the use of a validation set** or the specific criteria used to split the data into training and test subsets.
