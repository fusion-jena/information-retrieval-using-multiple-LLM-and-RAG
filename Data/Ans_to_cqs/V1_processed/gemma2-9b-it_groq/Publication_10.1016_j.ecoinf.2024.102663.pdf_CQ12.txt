The provided text mentions using YOLO as a deep learning model and  Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings. 

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for object detection. 

Bidirectional LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) often used for sequence data processing. 


Therefore, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are CNN (YOLO) and RNN (Bidirectional LSTM).
