The provided text focuses on describing the MLPnn-MC modeling approach and its components, including the structure of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). It doesn't delve into specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot answer your query about regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.
