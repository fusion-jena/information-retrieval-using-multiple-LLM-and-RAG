The provided text describes the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics but doesn't specify the exact preprocessing steps applied to the images before training. 

We know the images were resized to 1333 Ã— 800 pixels to match the pre-training data (COCO dataset) and save computing time.  

However, it doesn't mention other common preprocessing steps like:

* **Normalization:** Scaling pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve model training stability.
* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like rotation, flipping, or cropping to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.
* **Cleaning:** Removing noise, artifacts, or irrelevant information from the images. 


Therefore, based on the given context, we can't definitively say what other preprocessing steps were used.
