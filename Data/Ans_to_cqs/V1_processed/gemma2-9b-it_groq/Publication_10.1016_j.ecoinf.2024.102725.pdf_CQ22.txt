The text states that four evaluation metrics are used to assess the disparities between the predicted and actual NDVI images:

* **Coefficient of determination (R2)**: Measures the goodness-of-fit, ranging from -âˆž to 1. 
* **Root mean squared error (RMSE)**:  Evaluates the discrepancy between predicted and observed values, with a higher value indicating a larger deviation.
* **Mean absolute error (MAE)**:  Not explicitly defined in the provided text, but generally measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
* **Error relative global accuracy (ERGAS)**: Not explicitly defined in the provided text. 


The text does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics.
