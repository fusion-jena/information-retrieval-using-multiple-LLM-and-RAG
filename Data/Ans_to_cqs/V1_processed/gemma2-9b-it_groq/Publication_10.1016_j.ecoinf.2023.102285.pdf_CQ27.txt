The provided text describes the development and evaluation of a deep learning model for man-made object detection in underwater environments.  

It outlines a four-phase process for ensuring the model's viability:

1. **Data Utilization and Data Processing:** This phase focuses on preparing the dataset for training the model.
2. **Model Training:** The deep learning model is trained using the prepared dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on a separate dataset to assess its performance.
4. **Deployment:** If the model successfully passes the evaluation, it can be deployed for real-world applications.

However, the text does not specify the exact process followed for deploying the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
