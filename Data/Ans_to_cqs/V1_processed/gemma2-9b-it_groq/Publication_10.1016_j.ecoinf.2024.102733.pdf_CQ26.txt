The provided text discusses techniques used to address data imbalance, which is a type of bias, specifically during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. 

Here are the techniques mentioned:

* **Undersampling:** Randomly removing samples from the majority class to balance the dataset.
* **Oversampling:** Duplicating samples from the minority class to balance the dataset.
* **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE):**  Generating synthetic samples based on the feature space by combining features from neighboring samples in the minority class.


The text does not mention "Stratified splitting" or "Diverse data collection" as techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
