The provided text focuses on comparing the performance of traditional deep learning with few-shot learning techniques for coral reef fish species identification.  

While it mentions optimization-based few-shot learning algorithms (citing Nichol and Schulman, 2018), it doesn't specify the exact optimization techniques used within those algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam).
