The provided text focuses on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

It specifically mentions ResNet, a CNN architecture, and its comparison to newer models like ViT (Vision Transformer), Swin Transformer, and ConvNeXt.  While ViT and Swin are transformer-based models, the text emphasizes the performance of CNN architectures like ResNet and its evolution, ConvNeXt. 


Therefore, based on the information given, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is likely a CNN.
