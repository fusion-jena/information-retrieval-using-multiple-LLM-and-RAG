The provided text describes the methodology used to train and transfer knowledge between datasets for plant species classification.  It details the steps involved in pre-training and fine-tuning a deep learning model but doesn't mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

* **Diverse dataset:**  While the text mentions using herbarium specimens from different regions, it doesn't explicitly state the diversity of the datasets used for training and evaluation.
* **Cross-validation:** The text doesn't describe the use of cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Stratified splitting:**  There's no mention of stratified splitting of the data into training and testing sets to maintain class proportions. 


Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
