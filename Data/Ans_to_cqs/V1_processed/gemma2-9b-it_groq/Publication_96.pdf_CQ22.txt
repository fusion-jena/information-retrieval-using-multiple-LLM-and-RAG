The text states that the accuracy of each algorithm was generated, and a confusion matrix was used to assess the accuracy of the mapping.  The confusion matrix includes metrics such as:

* **User's accuracy:**  This metric reflects the proportion of correctly classified burned areas out of all areas classified as burned.
* **Producer's accuracy:** This metric reflects the proportion of correctly classified burned areas out of all actual burned areas.
* **Total accuracy:** This metric represents the overall accuracy of the classification, calculated as the proportion of correctly classified pixels (both burned and non-burned) out of the total number of pixels.
