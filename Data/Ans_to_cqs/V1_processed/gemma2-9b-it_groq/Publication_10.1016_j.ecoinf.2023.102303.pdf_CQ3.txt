The provided text states that the FishInTurbidWater dataset was "quickly and weakly labeled".  

It goes on to describe two different deep learning models:

* **Semi-supervised contrastive learning:** This model was first trained using self-supervised contrastive learning and then fine-tuned on the weakly labeled dataset. The text doesn't specify the exact type of weak labeling used in this stage.

* **Weakly-supervised ensemble:** Two pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) were transferred to the weakly labeled dataset. These individual DNNs were then ensembled using XGBoost. Again, the specific weak labeling technique used for this stage isn't detailed. 


While the text mentions "weakly labeled", it doesn't explicitly describe the data annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation).
