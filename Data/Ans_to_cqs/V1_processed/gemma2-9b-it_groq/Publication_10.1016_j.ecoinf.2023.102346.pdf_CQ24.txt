The provided text focuses on species distribution modeling and machine learning techniques in ecology, not deep learning. Therefore, it doesn't offer information about strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. 

Strategies for handling randomness in deep learning often involve:

* **Setting a random seed:** This initializes the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of results.

* **Data augmentation:**  Artificially increasing the size and diversity of the training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to existing data points.
* **Dropout:** Randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a percentage of neurons during training to prevent overfitting and encourage the network to learn more robust features.
* **Batch normalization:**  Normalizing the activations of each layer during training, which can help stabilize learning and reduce the impact of weight initialization.
