The provided text focuses on the deep learning model's training and architecture rather than the data collection methods.  It mentions "in-situ EC measurements" and "remote sensing" as inputs for the model but doesn't specify the exact techniques used for data acquisition. 


Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively say what specific methods were used to collect the raw data.
