The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using mean reciprocal rank (MRR), accuracy (ACC), average accuracy across all class hierarchies (avg_ACC), and hierarchical distance of a mistake (HDM). 

* **MRR** is used for processes that generate a ranked list of potential responses to queries. 
* **Accuracy (ACC)** measures the proportion of correctly classified items.
* **Average accuracy (avg_ACC)** is calculated across all class hierarchies to evaluate hierarchical classification performance.
* **Hierarchical distance of a mistake (HDM)** quantifies the degree of misclassification when only one class can be predicted, considering the hierarchy of the classification.
