Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses **image** data. 

Several references mention the use of images for tasks like:

* **Pest recognition:** Papers [18], [19], [20], [21] discuss using deep learning for identifying insect pests in agricultural settings, clearly indicating image data as the input.
* **Water pollution analysis:** Paper [18] uses deep learning with CNN architectures on near-infrared images for water pollution analysis.
* **COVID-19 and pneumonia diagnosis:** Paper [25] mentions using deep learning classifiers on X-ray scans for disease diagnosis.

While the context doesn't explicitly mention other data formats like audio, video, or CSV, it's plausible that they could be used in broader deep learning applications not covered in these specific references.
