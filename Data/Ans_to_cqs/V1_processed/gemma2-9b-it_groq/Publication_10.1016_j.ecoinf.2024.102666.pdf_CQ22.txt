The provided text mentions the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate the performance of a model. 

RMSE is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and true values. A smaller RMSE indicates higher accuracy.

MAE represents the average of the absolute differences between the true value and the predicted value.  A smaller MAE also signifies a closer match between predictions and actual values.
