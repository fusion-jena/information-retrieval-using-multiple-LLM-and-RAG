The provided text focuses on hyperparameter optimization for a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, not a deep learning model.  It doesn't specify the hyperparameters used for the RF model, let alone a deep learning model. 


Therefore, I cannot answer your query about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model based on the given context.
