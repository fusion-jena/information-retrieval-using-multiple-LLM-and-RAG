Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. 

Several papers mention the use of:

* **Airborne lidar data:** This type of data often comes in point cloud format, which can be processed and represented as images.
* **Landsat data:** This is satellite imagery, a common image data format used in remote sensing.
* **Sentinel-1 SAR data:** Synthetic Aperture Radar data, which can be processed into image-like representations.
* **GEDI spaceborne lidar data:** Similar to airborne lidar, this data is also point cloud based and can be visualized as images.

While the context focuses on remote sensing applications, it's important to note that deep learning can be applied to various data formats, including audio, video, and CSV.
