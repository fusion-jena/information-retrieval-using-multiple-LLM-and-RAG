The provided text describes data pre-processing as a crucial step for ensuring data reliability and integrity. It specifically mentions **data cleansing** as a key aspect, involving the identification and removal of incomplete or inaccurate records to ensure data accuracy. 

While the text doesn't explicitly list all preprocessing steps like normalization or scaling, it implies that various methods were employed to prepare the data for analysis.  

Therefore, we can infer that data cleansing was a key preprocessing step, and it's likely that other common techniques like normalization and scaling were also used to prepare the data for training the AODEGRU model.
