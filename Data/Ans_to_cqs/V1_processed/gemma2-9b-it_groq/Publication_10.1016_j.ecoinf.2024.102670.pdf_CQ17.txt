The provided text focuses on the application of deep learning in image analysis, particularly in tasks like karyotyping and analyzing brain microvasculature. It doesn't delve into specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. 

Therefore, I cannot answer your query about regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization based on the given context.
