Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used, the layers and their shapes, and the supplementary materials provided. It also includes information about the authors, their contributions, and the references. However, it does not provide any information about the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
