Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, specifically population modeling and time series analysis of rabbit populations. It discusses various mathematical models, such as the random walk, order-1 autoregressive Gompertz model, and order-2 autoregressive Gompertz model, but does not touch on deep learning or randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
