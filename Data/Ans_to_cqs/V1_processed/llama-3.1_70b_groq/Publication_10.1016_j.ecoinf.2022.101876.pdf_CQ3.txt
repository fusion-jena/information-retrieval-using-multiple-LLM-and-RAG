Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the challenges of processing large amounts of data, particularly images, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images.

However, it is mentioned that AI tools are used to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images, which implies that some form of annotation or labeling is required to train these models. But the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
