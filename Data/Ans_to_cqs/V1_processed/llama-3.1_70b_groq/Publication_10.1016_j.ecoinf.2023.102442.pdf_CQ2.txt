Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely involves image data, specifically satellite imagery from platforms such as Landsat and Sentinel-2. The context mentions the use of multispectral convolutional neural networks for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana, which suggests that image data is being used as input for the deep learning model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which provides a public catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. This further supports the idea that image data is being used in the pipeline.

There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is also not explicitly mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline, but it is possible that CSV files are used to store metadata or other information related to the image data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline likely involves image data, specifically satellite imagery, but the exact data formats used are not explicitly stated.
