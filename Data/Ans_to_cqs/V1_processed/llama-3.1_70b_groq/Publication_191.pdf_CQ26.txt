Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does highlight the issue of limited data in the PlantClef2015 dataset, which has only around 113,205 images, and notes that this is far from matching the scale and variety of existing general major datasets.

The context does mention the use of data fusion methods, such as average (ave) or max voting (mav), to combine the softmax outputs of multiple networks during the validation phase. However, this is not directly related to addressing data bias during preprocessing.

It also mentions the use of a technique called DN approach [36] to visualize the feature maps and understand the transformation of the features learned in each layer. However, this is not a technique for addressing data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
