Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of symbols and characters, possibly from a corrupted or encoded text file. It does not provide any meaningful information about the topic of model training or postprocessing steps.

However, I can provide general information about common postprocessing steps involved after model training. These steps may include:

1. Saliency maps: These are visual representations of the model's predictions, highlighting the most important features or inputs that contribute to the predictions.
2. Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, etc. to evaluate the model's performance.
3. Confusion matrix: This is a table used to evaluate the model's performance by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.
4. Model interpretation: This involves analyzing the model's predictions and understanding how the model is making decisions.
5. Model evaluation: This involves evaluating the model's performance on a test dataset and comparing it with other models.

Please note that these are general postprocessing steps, and the specific steps involved may vary depending on the problem, model, and dataset.
