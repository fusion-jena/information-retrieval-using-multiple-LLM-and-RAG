Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a tabular format, such as CSV.

The context mentions the use of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, which are commonly used for working with tabular data. Additionally, the text mentions the use of Keras, a deep learning library, but does not specify the type of data being used.

There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats in the provided context. The focus appears to be on working with numerical data, such as temperature profiles and stratification data.

Therefore, while it is not possible to provide a definitive answer, it is likely that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are tabular formats, such as CSV.
