The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the models were trained for a varying number of epochs (up to 12) and their performance was evaluated at each training stage. The context also mentions that the models' performance was measured using Average Precision (AP) scores and mean Average Precision (mAP) scores. This suggests that the performance of the models was monitored and evaluated at regular intervals during training, but the exact strategy or metrics used to monitor performance are not specified.
