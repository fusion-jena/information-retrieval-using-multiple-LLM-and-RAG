Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the baseline model, the incorporation of contextual information, and the use of deep learning in various research fields. It does mention the use of spectrograms as input data, but it does not provide details on how the data was annotated or preprocessed. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
