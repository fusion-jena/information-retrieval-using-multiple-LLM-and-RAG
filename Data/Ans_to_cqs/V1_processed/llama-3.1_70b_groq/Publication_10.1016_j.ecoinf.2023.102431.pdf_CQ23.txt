The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it describes the use of linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression for species and sex classification. However, it does mention some measures that were taken to ensure the reliability and validity of the results.

The dataset was split into training, validation, and test groups (Table 1), which suggests that some form of cross-validation or splitting was used to evaluate the performance of the models. However, the specific details of the splitting procedure (e.g., stratified splitting) are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a predictor screening analysis with bootstrap forest partitioning to evaluate the contribution of predictors on the response object. This suggests that the authors attempted to identify the most relevant variables for the classification task.

The authors also evaluated the dataset for potential sources of bias, including foot position bias and observer bias. They used a stepwise variable selection procedure to select the variables with the best discriminating power and used linear discriminant analysis to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane.

Overall, while the context does not specifically mention measures to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does suggest that the authors took steps to evaluate the performance of their models and identify potential sources of bias.
