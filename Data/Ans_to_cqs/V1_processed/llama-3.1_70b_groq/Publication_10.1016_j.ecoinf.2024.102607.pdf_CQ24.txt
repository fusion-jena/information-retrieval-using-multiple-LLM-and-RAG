Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be focused on land use/cover classification (LULC) mapping using remote sensing data and Google Earth Engine, with a emphasis on a novel space-spectrum array tile probability random-forest model. It does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline or randomness handling strategies. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
