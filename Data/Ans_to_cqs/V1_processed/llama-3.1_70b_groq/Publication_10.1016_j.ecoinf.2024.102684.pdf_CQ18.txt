The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets. The model is trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated on the validation data. This approach allows for the assessment of overfitting by comparing the model's performance on the training, validation, and test datasets. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE), which provide insight into the model's ability to explain the variation in the response variable and the accuracy of its predictions, respectively.
