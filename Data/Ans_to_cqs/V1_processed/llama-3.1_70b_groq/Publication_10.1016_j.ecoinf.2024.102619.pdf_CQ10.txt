Unfortunately, I don't know the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The provided context mentions that commercial restrictions apply to the availability of the data used in this work, but it does mention that links to public code examples can be found. However, it does not provide a direct link to the code repository. It does provide links to the documentation for PyTorch, scikit-learn, and skorch, which are (PyTorch, 2023), (scikit-learn, 2023), and (skorch, 2022) respectively.
