Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data is split into several larger blocks, depending on coordinates, and then into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels. It also mentions that the data is from maps, and that OpenStreetMap Contributors (2017) is one of the references.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model is trained on pre-labelled data, but it does not specify the source or name of the dataset. It is possible that the dataset is a custom or proprietary dataset, or that it is a dataset that is not widely known.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
