I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification of voice-recorded data, specifically mosquito sounds. It discusses the automatic feature extraction process in deep learning, the use of spectrograms as visual representations of sound, and the optimization of CNN model parameters. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
