Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the encoder and decoder, the pre-processing block, and the auto-encoding process. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
