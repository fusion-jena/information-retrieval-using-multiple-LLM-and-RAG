Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the text, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely involves remote sensing data, as mentioned in the sentence: "from remote sensing characterization of environmental heterogeneity on the other hand, requires adapted DL workflows."

Additionally, the text mentions "citizen science observations" and "computer vision model", which suggests that the pipeline may involve image data. However, this is not explicitly stated.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context. CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is also not mentioned, but it is possible that it is used as an input format for the presence-only samples or other data.

In summary, while the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated, it is likely that the pipeline involves remote sensing data and possibly image data.
