The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation set. According to the provided context, the validation set is a set of samples set aside separately during the model training. It is used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the model's capabilities. This suggests that the validation set is used to monitor the model's performance during training and make adjustments as needed. Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance is evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation method, where the mean value of the ten results is used to estimate the accuracy of the model.
