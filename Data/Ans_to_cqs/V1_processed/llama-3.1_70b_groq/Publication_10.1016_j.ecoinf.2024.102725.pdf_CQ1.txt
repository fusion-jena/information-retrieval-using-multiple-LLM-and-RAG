Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning and other techniques for reconstructing and analyzing NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series data, rather than the data collection process itself.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used in the studies mentioned are likely derived from remote sensing sources, such as satellite imagery (e.g., MODIS, Sentinel-2). The context also mentions the use of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, which is another type of remote sensing data.

Additionally, some studies mentioned in the context, such as Benedetti and Rossini (1993), use NDVI profiles as a tool for agricultural statistics, which may involve collecting data from surveys or other sources. However, this is not explicitly stated in the context.

Therefore, while the context provides some hints about the potential sources of data, it does not provide a clear answer to the question about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
