I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to landscape planning and design, and discusses the use of image-based methods and 3D spatial metrics for analyzing and evaluating landscape visual quality. It mentions the use of convolutional neural networks for automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs, but does not provide information on the specific datasets used in this application.
