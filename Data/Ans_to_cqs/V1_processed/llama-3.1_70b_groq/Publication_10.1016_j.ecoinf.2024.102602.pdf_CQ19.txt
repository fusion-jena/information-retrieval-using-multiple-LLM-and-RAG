Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of open-source CNNs such as VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. It is possible that the authors used a popular deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, but without further information, it is impossible to say for certain.
