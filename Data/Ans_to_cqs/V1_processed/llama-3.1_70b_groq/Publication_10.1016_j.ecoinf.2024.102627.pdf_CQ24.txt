Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for species assemblage prediction and mapping global orchid assemblages, but it does not delve into the details of handling randomness or variability in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
