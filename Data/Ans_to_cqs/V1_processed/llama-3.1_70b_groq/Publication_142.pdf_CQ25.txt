The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of Pl@ntNet is classification. The model is used to classify plant species based on images provided by users. The model is trained on a large dataset of images and is fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data to improve its accuracy. The classification tool is available through a dedicated API and can accept one to five images of a plant and return a list of likely species, along with classification scores and matching images retrieved from the database. The model's primary function is to identify and classify plant species, making it a classification model.
