The purpose of the deep learning model presented in the context is to reconstruct non-observed representations in a matrix, specifically for imputing missing data. The model combines the interpretation and mathematical meaning of Matrix Factorization (MF) with the learning capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) to capture spatial-temporal characteristics of data. The model aims to improve the quality of imputations by including several variables of interest (time, location) into the inference process. The specific task of the model is not explicitly stated as classification, segmentation, or detection, but rather as a matrix completion task, where the goal is to fill in missing values in a matrix.
