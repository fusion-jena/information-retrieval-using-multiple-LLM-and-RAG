I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or any information about where it is available. In fact, the text mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered but not used due to the limited number of samples, so it's unlikely that a code repository for a deep learning pipeline exists for this specific study.
