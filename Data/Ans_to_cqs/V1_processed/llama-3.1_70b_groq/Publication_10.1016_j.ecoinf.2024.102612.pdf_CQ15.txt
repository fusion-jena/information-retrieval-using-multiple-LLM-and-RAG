Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only discusses the evaluation metrics used, such as Mean IoU (MIoU) and Overall Accuracy, and the training process of the SoftGroup architecture over 1000 epochs. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training.
