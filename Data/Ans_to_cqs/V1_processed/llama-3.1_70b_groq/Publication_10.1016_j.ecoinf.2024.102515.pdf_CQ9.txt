Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that a training dataset is available at https://github.com/PabloOtero/diversimar_paper, but it does not specify if this is the same as the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
