The text does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) in a comparison experiment with SVM. This suggests that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is likely a type of Autoencoder, but it does not provide information on whether it is a CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
