Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or its availability on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context appears to be related to research papers and studies on remote sensing, machine learning, and tree species classification, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
