The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are macro F1 score, macro precision, and macro recall. The macro F1 score is used as the primary evaluation metric due to the significant imbalance of classes in the datasets. The corresponding macro precision and macro recall values are also provided in appendix A.
