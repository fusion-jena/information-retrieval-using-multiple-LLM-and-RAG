Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. This is evident from the mention of LSTM in several places throughout the text, including the title of the paper "Forecasting ENSO using convolutional LSTM network with improved attention mechanism and models recombined by genetic algorithm in CMIP5/6" and the section "2.4.3. Long-short-term-memory model". Additionally, the text mentions the use of LSTM models in machine learning and deep learning for sequential data tasks, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, time series forecasting, and more.
