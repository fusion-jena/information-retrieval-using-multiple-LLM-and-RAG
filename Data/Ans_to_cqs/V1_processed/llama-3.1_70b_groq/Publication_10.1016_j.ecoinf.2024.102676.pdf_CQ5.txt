Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context only mentions that a study used deep learning models to classify three sympatric otter species, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in the study. Additionally, it mentions a project called "North-American-Animal-Tracks-Database" but does not provide further details about the datasets used in the project. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
