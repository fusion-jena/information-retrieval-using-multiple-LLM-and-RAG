I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, data mining, and the Apriori algorithm, but it does not touch on deep learning or the splitting of data for model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
