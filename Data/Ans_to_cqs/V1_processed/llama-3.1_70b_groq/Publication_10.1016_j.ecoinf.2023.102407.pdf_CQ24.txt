Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning methods for species distribution predictions and mentions various machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. However, it does not delve into the specifics of managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, the context does mention the use of PyTorch, a deep learning library, in one of the references (Paszke et al., 2019). PyTorch does provide mechanisms for managing randomness, such as setting a random seed value using the `torch.manual_seed()` function. However, this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any specific points, please feel free to ask.
