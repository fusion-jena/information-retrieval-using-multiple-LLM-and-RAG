Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions the development and publication of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for acoustic detection, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to build these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
