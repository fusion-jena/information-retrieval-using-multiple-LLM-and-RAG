Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is manual annotation by non-expert users through crowd-sourcing, as mentioned in Sharma et al. (2017). This suggests that the annotation technique may involve tasks such as labeling or marking specific components or features in images, but the exact technique used is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions the development of a user interface for easily marking desired components, which implies that the annotation technique may involve some form of interactive labeling or annotation. However, the specific techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, while we can infer that manual annotation by non-expert users is one of the data annotation techniques used, we cannot provide a definitive answer on the specific techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
