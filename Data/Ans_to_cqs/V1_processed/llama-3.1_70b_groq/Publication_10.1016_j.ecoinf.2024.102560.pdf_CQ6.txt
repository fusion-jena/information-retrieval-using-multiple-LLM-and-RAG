Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental studies, specifically focusing on lake desiccation, soil erosion, and drought. It discusses various factors contributing to these issues, such as human activities, agricultural practices, and climate change. However, it does not provide any information about deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
