The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error. These metrics are defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) respectively. 

Commission error is calculated as the ratio of false positives (FP) to the sum of false positives and true positives (TP), i.e., FP / (FP + TP). Omission error is calculated as the ratio of false negatives (FN) to the sum of false negatives and true positives (TP), i.e., FN / (FN + TP).

Additionally, the model's performance is also evaluated in terms of time costs, which includes model training time costs and image recognition rate. The image recognition rate refers to the number of images recognized by the software in a unit of time. 

Note that the provided context does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model.
