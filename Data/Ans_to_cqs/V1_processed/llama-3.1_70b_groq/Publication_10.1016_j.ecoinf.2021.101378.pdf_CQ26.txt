Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on ecological modeling, species distribution, and pine wilt disease, with mentions of machine learning methods such as random forest, maximum entropy modeling, and ensemble models.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed techniques used to handle imbalanced datasets and reduce bias. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into subsets based on the class labels, ensuring that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of majority class samples.

Diverse data collection is also an important aspect of reducing bias in machine learning models. Collecting data from diverse sources and ensuring that the data represents the population of interest can help reduce bias and improve model generalizability.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide specific information on deep learning pipelines or techniques used to address data bias in this context. If you have any further questions or would like more information on a specific topic, please let me know.
