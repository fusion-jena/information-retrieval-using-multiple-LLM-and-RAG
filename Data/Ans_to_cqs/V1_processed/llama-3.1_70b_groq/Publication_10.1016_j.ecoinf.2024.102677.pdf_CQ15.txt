Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only discusses the selection and evaluation of different CNN architectures (VGG, Inception, ResNet) and their performance on the task of landscape type classification. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the models.
