The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that camera trap devices are used for collecting data, as mentioned in the context of ecological studies and wildlife monitoring. Camera traps are likely used to capture images of wildlife, which are then used as input data for deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of camera trap videos in the paper "DeepWILD: wildlife identification, localisation and estimation on camera trap videos using deep learning" by Simoes et al. (2023). This suggests that camera trap videos are also used as a source of raw data for deep learning models.

No other methods for collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets, are mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that camera trap devices are at least one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, but other methods may also be used that are not mentioned in the context.
