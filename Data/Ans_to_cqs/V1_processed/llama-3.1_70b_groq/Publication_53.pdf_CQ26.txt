Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the results of the study, the tools and software used for analysis, and the methodology for detecting farm dams using a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN). It does mention the use of a confusion matrix for farm dam detection (Figure S1) and a predicted probability for a successful verification (true positive) for each dam in the dataset (Figure S5), but it does not provide information on how data bias was addressed during preprocessing. Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias in this study.
