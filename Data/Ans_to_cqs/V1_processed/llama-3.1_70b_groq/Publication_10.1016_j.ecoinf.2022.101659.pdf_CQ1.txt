According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data include the use of sensors, specifically Biophys sensors developed at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ). These sensors are capable of measuring valve-gaping, water pressure, and temperature. The valve-gaping measurement is based on hall-sensor measurements, and the sensors are located in the head of the Biophys sensors.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of real-time monitoring networks, such as the one used in the lagoon of Venice, which collects data on phytoplanktonic production and system respiration. It also mentions the use of laboratory experiments, such as those conducted by Guarini et al. (2021) and Clements et al. (2018), which collect data on valve gaping and other physiological responses of organisms.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the provided context.
