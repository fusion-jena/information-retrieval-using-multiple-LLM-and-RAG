The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is hyperparameter optimization using both random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods. This was done using GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn and the Hyperopt library (version 0.2.7). The goal was to evaluate whether parameter adjustments had a beneficial impact on model performance. Additionally, a benchmark model with default parameters was established to compare the results with the optimized models.
