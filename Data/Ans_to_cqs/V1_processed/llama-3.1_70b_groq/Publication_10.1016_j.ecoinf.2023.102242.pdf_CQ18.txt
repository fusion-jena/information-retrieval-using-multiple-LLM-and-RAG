Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be discussing the results of a classification process, including accuracy percentages and Kappa values, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
