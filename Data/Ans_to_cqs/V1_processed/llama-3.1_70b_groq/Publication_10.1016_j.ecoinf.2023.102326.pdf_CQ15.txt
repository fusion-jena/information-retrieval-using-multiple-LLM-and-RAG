Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to network analysis, specifically discussing the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL) and its application to ecological informatics. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
