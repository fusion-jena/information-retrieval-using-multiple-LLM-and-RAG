Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to focus on the comparison of different covariate selection procedures and their impact on model accuracy and computation time. It discusses the results of the comparison, including the average computation time and model accuracy, but does not provide information on postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
