The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated in terms of validation loss plateau. However, it is mentioned that the model accuracy was continuously assessed using the validation set during training, and the performance of the testing set guided the final decision. Additionally, Fig. 6 illustrates the learning curves, which show a reduction in training losses as the number of epochs increases and convergence within 500 epochs. This suggests that the training process was stopped when the models converged, which is indicated by the stabilization of the loss and accuracy curves.
