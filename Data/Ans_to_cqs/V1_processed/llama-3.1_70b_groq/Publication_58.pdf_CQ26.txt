The techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include the median frequency balancing method. This method is used to balance the data sets, especially in the case of "semantic labeling" architectures, where it is difficult to precisely control the number of pixels per class.

It is also mentioned that the authors tried several methods to address data bias, but found negligible differences in performance. However, the specific methods tried are not mentioned in the provided context.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context.
