Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). The text only mentions the models used, such as YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, and their variants, but does not provide information about the underlying frameworks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
