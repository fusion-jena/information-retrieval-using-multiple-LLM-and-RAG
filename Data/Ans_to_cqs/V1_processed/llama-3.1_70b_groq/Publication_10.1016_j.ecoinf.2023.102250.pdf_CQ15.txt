Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the discriminator, the use of spectral normalization, and the dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition. It also mentions the application of LeakyReLU activation function and the use of Sigmoid and Softmax functions for binary classification and output prediction, respectively. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
