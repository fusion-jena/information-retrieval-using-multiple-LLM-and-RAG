Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning technologies, specifically convolutional neural networks, for plant species identification and plant cover information extraction. It mentions the use of ImageNet weights and ResNet50, but does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
