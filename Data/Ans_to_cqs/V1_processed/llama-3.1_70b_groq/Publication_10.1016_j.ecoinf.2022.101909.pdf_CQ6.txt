Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model receives RGB images of 224×224×3 as inputs, which are color spectrograms of two-second durations. It can be inferred that the audio data was converted into spectrograms, but the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned. Therefore, I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved in this case.
