I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the input parameters of permafrost models, the limitations of the GeNIe software, and the challenges of assessing permafrost model performance, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
