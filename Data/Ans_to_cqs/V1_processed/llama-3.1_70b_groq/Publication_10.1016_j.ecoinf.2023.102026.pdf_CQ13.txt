I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. It appears to be discussing a machine learning model using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used. The context also mentions a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), but again, no hyperparameters are mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
