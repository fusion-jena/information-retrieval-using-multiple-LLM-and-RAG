The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Optuna, a library for Bayesian optimization. Specifically, the Optuna library is used to optimize the structure and hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. For the LightGBM models, Optuna's LightGBM Tuner (optuna.integration.lightgbm) is used for hyperparameter fitting. The parameters and ranges for optimization are shown in Table 1. This approach allows for efficient and effective optimization of the hyperparameters, rather than relying on grid search or random search methods.
