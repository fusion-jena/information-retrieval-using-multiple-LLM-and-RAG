A random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure. This suggests that the deep learning pipeline employed a strategy of random search to handle randomness in the hyperparameters. However, the specific strategy used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
