I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, which is a type of unsupervised learning neural network, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
