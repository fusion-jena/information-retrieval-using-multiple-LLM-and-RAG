The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as metrics to quantify the discrepancies between predicted and true values in the context of remote sensing and land cover classification.

RMSE is defined as the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squared differences between the predicted and true values for each group, divided by the number of groups. A smaller RMSE value indicates higher algorithmic accuracy.

MAE is used to represent the average of the absolute error between the true value and the predicted value. A smaller MAE value indicates that the predicted value is closer to the true value.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a radar map to evaluate the performance of five algorithms, with metrics such as SAM, RMSE, and MAE being compared and ranked. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the metrics mentioned are RMSE and MAE, but it is not clear if these are the same metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.
