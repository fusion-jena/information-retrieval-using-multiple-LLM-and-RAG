Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning techniques are used in combination with statistical fundamentals to overcome the limitation of dataset size. It also mentions that deep learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that focuses on a learning method based on logical structures that closely resemble the architectural characteristics of the brain, but it does not provide information about the specific model used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
