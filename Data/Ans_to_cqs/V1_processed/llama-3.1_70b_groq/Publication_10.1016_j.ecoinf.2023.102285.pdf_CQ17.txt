Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on various topics such as underwater object detection, bird surveys, 3D posture data analysis, and image processing techniques. 

However, one of the references, Çalıs¸kan (2023), mentions the use of deep learning models for detecting human activity types from 3D posture data, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used.

Another reference, Han et al. (2022), proposes a deep learning technique titled LCSE-ResNet for marine man-made target classification, but it also does not mention the regularization methods used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
