The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is primarily for segmentation and classification tasks. Specifically, it is used for:

1. Segmentation: A Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model was developed by Xu et al. (2021) to outperform other methods, including the PCT method developed in Obara et al. (2012).
2. Classification: Guo et al. (2021) used a deep learning-based model to classify points of interest in 3D volumetric images, determining whether they were cross-over points/overlaps, and separating incoming filaments accordingly.

Additionally, the context mentions the potential development of a more specific detector, which could imply detection tasks. However, the primary focus of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is on segmentation and classification.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of all the possible applications of deep learning models in this domain. The mentioned studies and approaches might be specific to certain tasks or problems, and there could be other purposes or applications of deep learning models not mentioned in the provided context.
