Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the Conformer-Based Metric Generative Adversarial Network (CMGAN) model uses a learning rate of 5e-4 and learning rate decay after the first 30 epochs. This suggests that some form of learning rate scheduling is used, but the specific optimization algorithm (e.g., SGD, Adam) is not specified.
