Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image-based. The context mentions various studies that utilize remote sensing and aerial imagery, such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery, airborne lidar data, and satellite imagery, to train deep learning models for tasks like wetlands classification, mangrove crown diameter measurement, tree canopies segmentation, and individual tree detection.

Specifically, the studies mention the use of:

* BEV (Bird's Eye View) images with bounding box labels for training a Faster R-CNN detector
* Airborne lidar data for individual tree detection and segmentation
* Satellite imagery for land cover classification and object-based analysis
* UAV-LiDAR data for tree height measurements

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is not explicitly mentioned either, but it is possible that it might be used for storing or processing metadata associated with the image data.

Overall, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image-based, with a focus on remote sensing and aerial imagery.
