The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Horizontal flip
2. Gaussian noise addition
3. Contrast reduction

These techniques were used to increase the training set size fourfold, as the initial set of 290 training images was found to be insufficient to obtain satisfactory results. The contrast reduction strategy was specifically motivated by the application, as it helps to simulate areas of low lighting which can be expected in the dataset. 

There is no mention of rotating or scaling as data augmentation techniques in the provided context.
