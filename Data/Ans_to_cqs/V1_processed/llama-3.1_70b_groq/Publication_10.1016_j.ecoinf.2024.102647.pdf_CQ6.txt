Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the performance evaluation of different models (statistical and machine learning) for predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps, and feature selection. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are typically involved before training a deep learning model.
