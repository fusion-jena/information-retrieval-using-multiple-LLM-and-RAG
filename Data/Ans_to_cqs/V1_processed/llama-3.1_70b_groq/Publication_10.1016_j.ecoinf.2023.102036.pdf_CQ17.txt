Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on image classification, deep learning techniques, and statistical fundamentals, but it does not provide specific information on regularization methods.

However, I can suggest that the context mentions "exploiting existing deep learning techniques" and "statistical fundamentals" to overcome the limitation of small dataset size. This implies that the authors may be using various techniques to prevent overfitting, but the specific methods are not mentioned.

The context does mention "CAM: visual explanations from deep networks via gradient-based localization" and "image data augmentation for deep learning", which are techniques used to improve the performance of deep learning models. However, these are not regularization methods per se.

Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the query about specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
