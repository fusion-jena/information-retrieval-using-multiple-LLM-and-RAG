The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information on how the data was split in the specific experiment described.

According to the context, the dataset was split into training and validation sets. The training set consisted of 80 images for each class (Ziziphus lotus shrubs and Bare soil with sparse vegetation), while the validation set consisted of 20 images for each class. This split is summarized in Table 1.

It can be inferred that the split was done randomly, as the context mentions that the 100 images of each class were "distributed" into 80 images for training and 20 images for validation. However, the exact criteria used for the split (e.g., stratified sampling, random sampling) are not specified.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention a separate test set, which is typically used to evaluate the performance of a model after it has been trained and validated. Instead, the context mentions "Test-Zone-1" and "Test-Zone-2", which appear to be separate datasets used for testing the model, but the criteria used to split the data into these zones are not specified.
