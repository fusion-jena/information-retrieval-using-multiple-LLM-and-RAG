The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the approach used to split the dataset for model training and testing in general.

According to the context, the dataset was split into two distinct sets: 70% of the dataset was designated for model training, while the remaining 30% was used as the testing dataset. This approach was used to ensure that the model was trained on a sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset for evaluation.

There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context. It only mentions the training and testing datasets. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, specifically for train, test, and validation sets.
