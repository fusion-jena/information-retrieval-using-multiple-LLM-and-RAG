The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. The model was trained on a dataset of 7362 images, which were initially downloaded and then manually labeled into "dam" or "not dam" categories. The images were then used to train a classification model using transfer learning with an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model. The model was fine-tuned and validated using the same image dataset, with the goal of accurately classifying images as containing a dam or not. There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. Additionally, while CSV files may have been used to store metadata or labels for the images, the primary data format used in the pipeline is image data.
