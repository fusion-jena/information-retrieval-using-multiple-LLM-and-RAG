The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of an optimizer in the training loop of the AODEGRU model (Step 2: "Define the loss function and the optimizer."). Unfortunately, the type of optimizer used is not specified.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question of which optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the authors used a popular optimizer like SGD or Adam, but without further information, I cannot confirm this.
