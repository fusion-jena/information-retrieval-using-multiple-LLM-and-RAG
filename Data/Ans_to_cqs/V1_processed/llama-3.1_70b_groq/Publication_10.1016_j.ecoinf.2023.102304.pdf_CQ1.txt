Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and geospatial analysis, discussing various indices such as NDVI, EVI, and NBR, as well as techniques like BFAST and CCDC. However, it does not provide information on data collection methods for deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
