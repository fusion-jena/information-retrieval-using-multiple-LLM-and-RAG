I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning in the study by Huang et al. (2019), but it does not provide information on the deployment platform. The context also mentions the use of ArcGIS 10.8 for direct acquisition and reclassification of data, but this is a geographic information system (GIS) software, not a cloud platform. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
