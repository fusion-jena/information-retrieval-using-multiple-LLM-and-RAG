Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the importance of considering the "influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms" when working with hyperspectral data. This suggests that atmospheric correction may be a necessary preprocessing step when working with hyperspectral data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of machine learning algorithms to predict water quality parameters, which implies that some form of data preprocessing may be necessary to prepare the data for modeling. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, I can only speculate that common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning may be involved, but I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer.
