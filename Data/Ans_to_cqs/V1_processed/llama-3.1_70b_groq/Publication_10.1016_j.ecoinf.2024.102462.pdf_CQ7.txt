The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that in one experiment, the data was divided into 4 non-overlapping subsites to maximize the independence between the training and testing sets (Section 4.2.3). Additionally, it mentions that randomly dividing a single data set into training and testing sets is a common practice, but this may lead to overestimating practical performance. 

It also mentions that data augmentation was used to increase the number of patches for each class, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, the exact criteria used to split the data are not specified in the provided context.
