The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that "modeling package options enable automated tuning for parameters through resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final model configuration." This suggests that the modeling package used in the study may have some built-in functionality for hyperparameter tuning, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
