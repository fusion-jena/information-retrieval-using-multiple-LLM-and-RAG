The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to "signal processing applications" (Kiranyaz et al., 2019), "bioacoustic signal classification" (Xie et al., 2021), and "wildlife videos" (Schindler and Steinhage, 2021), it can be inferred that the pipeline may involve audio and video data formats.

Additionally, the context mentions "trajectories" and "fish event classification", which suggests that the pipeline may also involve time-series data or sensor readings. However, the specific format of this data (e.g., CSV, JSON, etc.) is not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention image data formats, despite the references to computer vision tasks and techniques. However, this does not necessarily mean that image data is not used in the pipeline, as the context is not exhaustive.

Overall, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline may involve audio, video, and time-series data formats, but the specific formats and details are not explicitly mentioned.
