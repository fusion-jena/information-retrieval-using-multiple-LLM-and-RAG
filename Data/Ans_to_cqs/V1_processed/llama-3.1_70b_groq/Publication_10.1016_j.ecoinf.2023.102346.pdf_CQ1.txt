Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on research papers and studies related to ecology, biology, and environmental science, with some mentions of machine learning and data analysis.

However, I can infer that some of the studies mentioned in the context might have used various methods for collecting raw data, such as:

* Field observations and surveys (e.g., Jones, C.M., Hallin, S., 2010)
* Sensors and monitoring equipment (e.g., Voss, M., Dippner, J.W., Humborg, C., 2011)
* Public datasets and existing databases (e.g., Tyberghein, L., Verbruggen, H., Pauly, K., 2012)

But without more specific information, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
