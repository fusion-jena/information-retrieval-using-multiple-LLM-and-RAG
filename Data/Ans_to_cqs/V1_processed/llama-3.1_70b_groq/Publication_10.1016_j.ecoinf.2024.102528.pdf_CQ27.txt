Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text discusses the use of the BirdNET deep learning model and the BirdNET-Analyzer framework for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations, but it does not provide details on the deployment process.

The context mentions that the authors applied the framework to over 80 species and selected 20 species with the highest recall scores for further analysis, but it does not discuss how the model was serialized, which platform was selected for deployment, or any other details related to the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
