The provided context does not specifically discuss the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that in the context of Random Forest (RF) modeling, the dataset was randomly divided into two subsets, with 75% of the data used for training and 25% for testing. Additionally, it is mentioned that the random sampling was done with the condition of maintaining the covariance structure among the predictor variables relatively intact between the training and testing datasets. 

It is also worth noting that the context does not explicitly mention deep learning models, but rather focuses on RF modeling and other machine learning algorithms. Therefore, the answer to the query is not directly provided in the given context.
