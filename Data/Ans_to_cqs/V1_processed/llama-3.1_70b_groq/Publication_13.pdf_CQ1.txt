The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the images used for the Local Low Quality (LL) dataset were obtained by individually photographing single specimens from bulk samples using a conventional stereoscope NIKON SMZ1270i equipped with a NIKON DS-Fi3 Microscope Camera. This suggests that the raw data collection method used in this specific study involves manual photography of specimens using a microscope camera. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the study is part of a high-throughput biodiversity survey, which implies that the raw data collection may involve surveys or sampling of specimens from different sites around the world. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not clearly specified in the provided context.
