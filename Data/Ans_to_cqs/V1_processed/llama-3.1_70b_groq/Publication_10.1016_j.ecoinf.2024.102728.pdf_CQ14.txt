I don't know. The provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters or the use of techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be related to a methodology description for a classification problem, specifically a nested hierarchical classification (NHC) approach, and references various papers on topics such as hierarchy theory, image retrieval, and ecological studies. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters.
