Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses various deep learning models, such as DeepLabV3, DeepLabV3+, and VGG16, and their applications in image segmentation tasks. It also mentions the use of transfer learning and the adaptation of pre-trained models for specific tasks.

However, it does mention the importance of having a large training sample to maintain good performance, which could be related to addressing data bias. But it does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. The techniques mentioned in the query, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection, are common techniques used to address data bias, but I do not know if they are used in the specific context provided.
