None of the mentioned frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the model. The text mentions that the modeling approach was employed using the BIOMOD2 package in R, and the models used were regression-based, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are not deep learning frameworks.
