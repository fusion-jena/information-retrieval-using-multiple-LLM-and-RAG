Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on various deep learning architectures, such as transformers, convolutional neural networks, and object detection models, as well as some papers on aquatic animals and marine habitats.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation of underrepresented groups.

It's worth noting that these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, and I'm providing this information based on general knowledge of deep learning and data preprocessing. If you're looking for specific information on how these techniques are applied in the context of the provided papers, I would recommend checking the original papers or searching for additional resources.
