According to the provided context, one preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is batch normalization. This step is applied to the input data, which is 40-dimensional. The batch normalization process involves calculating the mean of each channel in the current batch, then calculating the variance of each channel in the current batch. The mean is subtracted from the input, and the result is divided by the standard deviation to obtain the normalized output. This normalized output is then scaled by a parameter γ and shifted by a parameter β to obtain the final output.

No other preprocessing steps, such as scaling or cleaning, are mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the input data has large differences in distribution between different batches and between the training and test sets, which is why batch normalization is applied.
