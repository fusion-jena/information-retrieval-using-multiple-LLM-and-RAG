I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to data management, data usage policies, and data integration in the field of environmental science, specifically in projects such as AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics. It discusses the challenges of integrating data from different sources and the need for compatible data usage policies, but it does not mention deep learning models or their evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the provided context.
