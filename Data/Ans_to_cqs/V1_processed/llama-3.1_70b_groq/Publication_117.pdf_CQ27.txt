Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning algorithms and citizen science data for image counts, but it does not provide details on model serialization, platform selection, or deployment. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
