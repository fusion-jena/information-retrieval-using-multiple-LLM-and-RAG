I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training, data splitting criteria, or the specific requirements for training, testing, and validation datasets. The context appears to be focused on data management, citation, and accessibility in the context of the ESS-DIVE data repository, rather than machine learning or deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
