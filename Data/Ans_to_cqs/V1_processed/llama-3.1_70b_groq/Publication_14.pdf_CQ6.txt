The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the author collected images for each class and trained a fine-tuned neural network with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. It also mentions that the feature vectors for the frozen layers were extracted in parallel using Google Cloud DataFlow.

Additionally, the context mentions that the author used a pre-trained model and fine-tuned it for their specific task. This suggests that the pre-trained model may have already undergone some preprocessing steps, such as normalization or scaling, but the context does not provide specific details.

The context does mention that the author used dropout as a form of regularization to reduce overfitting, but this is a technique used during training rather than a preprocessing step.

Overall, the context does not provide enough information to give a detailed answer to the query about preprocessing steps.
