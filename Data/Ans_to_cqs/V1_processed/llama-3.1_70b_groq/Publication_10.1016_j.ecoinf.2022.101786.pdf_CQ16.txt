The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it mentions that the training process involves cycles of training on the training set, evaluating performance on the validation set, and adjusting CNN node weights. It also mentions that there is an optimum number of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets starts to diverge as the CNN overfits. This suggests that the training process may be stopped when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, but the exact criteria used to determine this is not specified.
