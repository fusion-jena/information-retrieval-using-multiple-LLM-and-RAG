I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article discussing the use of deep learning for RGB tree crown detection, but it does not include any information about a publicly available code repository. If you are looking for the code, you may want to try contacting the authors directly or searching for a separate publication or repository that may include the code.
