Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of a python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier, which is a type of gradient boosting framework, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.

However, it is mentioned that the XGBoostClassifier is used to classify the VTs (Vegetation Types), and that the algorithm is trained using a set of input features, including seasonal vegetation index composites from S2, backscatter composites from S1, elevation, and slope. The text also mentions that the compositing periods were chosen based on certain criteria, but it does not provide further details on the optimization techniques used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
