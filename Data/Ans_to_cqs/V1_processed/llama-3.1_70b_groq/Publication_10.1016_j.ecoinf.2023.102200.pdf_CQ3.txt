Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some information from the papers mentioned.

In the paper by Jin et al. (2018), the authors used Faster R-CNN and regional growth algorithms for individual maize segmentation from terrestrial lidar data. This suggests that bounding box annotation might be used, as R-CNN is a popular object detection algorithm that uses bounding box annotations.

In the paper by Chen et al. (2021), the authors used PointNet, a deep learning architecture, for individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used.

In the paper by IsÄ±n et al. (2016), the authors reviewed MRI-based brain tumor image segmentation using deep learning methods. They mentioned that data annotation is a crucial step in deep learning-based image segmentation, but they did not specify the annotation techniques used.

In summary, while we can infer that bounding box annotation might be used in some cases, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the question about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
