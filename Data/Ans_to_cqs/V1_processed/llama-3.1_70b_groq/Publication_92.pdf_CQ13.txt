Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only discusses the architecture of the network, which is based on GoogLeNet with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. It also mentions that some parameters, such as the size of the strides and the first convolutions, were adapted to the size of the thumbnails to achieve better results. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for training the model.
