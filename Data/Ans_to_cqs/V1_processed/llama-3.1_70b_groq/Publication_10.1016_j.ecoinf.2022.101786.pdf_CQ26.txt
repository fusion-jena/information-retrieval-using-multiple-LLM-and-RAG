Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model selection, training process, and evaluation of a CNN model for deep-sea image analysis.

However, it does mention the challenge of collecting representative datasets in the deep sea, which implies that data collection is a crucial aspect of the study. Additionally, the context mentions that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets, which suggests that the data was carefully curated to ensure quality and accuracy.

But, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
