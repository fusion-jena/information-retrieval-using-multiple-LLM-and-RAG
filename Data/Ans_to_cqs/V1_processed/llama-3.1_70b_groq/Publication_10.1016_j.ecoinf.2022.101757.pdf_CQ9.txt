I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ available on GitHub (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf), but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.
