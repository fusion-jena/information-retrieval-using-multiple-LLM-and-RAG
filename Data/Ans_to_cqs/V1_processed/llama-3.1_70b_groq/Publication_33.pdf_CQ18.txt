The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the two-phase approach to building a classification model, where the first phase involves training a CNN on a database T0, and the second phase involves tuning a risk threshold using a second and independent database T1. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during the training phase.
