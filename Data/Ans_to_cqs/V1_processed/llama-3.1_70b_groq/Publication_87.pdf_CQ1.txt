Based on the provided context, one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is camera traps. The text mentions "Collecting images with camera traps" and "photographic capture-recapture" as a means of monitoring a Eurasian lynx population. This suggests that camera traps are used to collect images of animals in their natural habitat, which can then be used as raw data for deep learning models. Additionally, the text mentions "large amounts of images" and "a dataset of labelled images", implying that the images collected from camera traps are used to train and validate deep learning models. However, it does not provide information on other methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
