Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a study on fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, but it does not provide information on the training process or model performance monitoring. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
