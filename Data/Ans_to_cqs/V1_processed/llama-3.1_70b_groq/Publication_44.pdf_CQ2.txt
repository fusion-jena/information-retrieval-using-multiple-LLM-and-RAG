The data format used in the deep learning pipeline, as per the provided context, is images. Specifically, the context mentions "input images" and "herbarium sheet images" being used for training deep learning models. The images are resized to specific resolutions (300 × 300 and 512 × 512) to reduce computational cost during training. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
