To ensure the generalizability of the models, including the deep learning model (Artificial Neural Network), several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was split into two distinct sets: 70% of the dataset was designated for model training, while the remaining 30% was used as a testing dataset. This approach ensured that the model was trained on a sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset for evaluation.

Secondly, k-fold cross-validation was employed to assess the performance of the models. Specifically, a 10-fold cross-validation design was used, where the dataset was divided into 10 subsets. Some of these subsets were used for training the model, while the others were utilized to evaluate its performance. This technique helps prevent overfitting by evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

Lastly, the use of Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) was employed to identify the most effective set of hyperparameters for each model, including the deep learning model. GSCV generates a series of models, each characterized by a different set of hyperparameters, and evaluates their performance through cross-validation. The model with the optimal hyperparameter combination was selected based on its superior performance.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting, the use of cross-validation and GSCV, along with the splitting of the dataset into training and testing sets, helps ensure the generalizability of the models, including the deep learning model.
