Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that "After the training is completed, the trained model is used to predict water conditions and analyze performance using the test data set that was not employed during the learning stage." (Section 2.4.5), but it does not provide details on how the completion of training is determined. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
