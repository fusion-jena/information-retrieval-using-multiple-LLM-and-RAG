The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the AdamW optimizer. This is mentioned in the text as follows: "During all three phases, we use a ResNet50 (He et al., 2016), which is initialized with ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) weights from Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) before phase 1 and phase 2, as well as the AdamW optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014; Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017)."
