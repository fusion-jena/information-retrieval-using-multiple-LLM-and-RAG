The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are:

1. R2 (coefficient of determination)
2. Root Average Squared Errors (RASE)
3. Average Absolute Error (AAE)

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Bootstrap Forest, Boosted Tree, and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), for predicting Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD). The values of these metrics are reported in Table 4, which provides an overall model comparison for the best-fit model under each method.
