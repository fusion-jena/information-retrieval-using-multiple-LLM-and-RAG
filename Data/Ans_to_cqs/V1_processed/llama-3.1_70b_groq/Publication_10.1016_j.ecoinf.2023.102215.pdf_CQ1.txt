Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and design of convolutional neural networks, specifically the U2-Net model, and their applications in image segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks.

However, based on the references to agricultural and forestry applications, it can be inferred that the raw data might be collected through methods such as:

* Image capture using cameras or drones
* Sensor data from IoT devices
* Public datasets related to agriculture and forestry

But without explicit information, it's difficult to provide a more specific answer. The context does not provide enough details on the data collection process, and it's unclear what methods are used to gather the raw data for the deep learning pipeline.
