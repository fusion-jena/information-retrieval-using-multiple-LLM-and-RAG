I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. In fact, the text suggests that the authors are considering testing more advanced methods of data analysis, including machine learning or deep neural networks, in the future, but they have not done so yet. The model used in the study is a spatial modeling approach that integrates remote sensing data and topographic indices, and its parameters are estimated using a method recommended by the authors of the mgcv library. However, the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model are not mentioned.
