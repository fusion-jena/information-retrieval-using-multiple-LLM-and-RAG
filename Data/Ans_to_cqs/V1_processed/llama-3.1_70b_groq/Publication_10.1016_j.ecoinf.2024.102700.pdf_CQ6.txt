Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, as a trend in ecological informatics modeling, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this context.
