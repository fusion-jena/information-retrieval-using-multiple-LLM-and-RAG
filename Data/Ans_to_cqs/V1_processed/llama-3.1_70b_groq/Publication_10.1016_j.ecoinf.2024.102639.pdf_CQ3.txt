Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning methodologies to predict animal behavior, particularly in T-maze experiments. It discusses the integration of different algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Principal Component Analysis-Support Vector Machine (PCA-SVM), but does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
