The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "data augmentation" as a technique used to estimate ÏƒARU by adding a number of known 'non-detections' with distance of NA to the dataset of detected or simulated calls. This suggests that data augmentation is used to increase the size and diversity of the dataset, which can help to reduce bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the CNN model is trained on a dataset collected from multiple sites around Georgia and Alabama, USA, which may indicate that diverse data collection is used to reduce bias. However, it is not explicitly stated as a technique used to address data bias.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these techniques are used in the preprocessing pipeline.
