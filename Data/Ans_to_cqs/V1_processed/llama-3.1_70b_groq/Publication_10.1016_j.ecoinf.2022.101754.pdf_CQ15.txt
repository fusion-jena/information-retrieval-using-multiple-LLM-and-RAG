I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses various machine learning methods, including random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used in these methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
