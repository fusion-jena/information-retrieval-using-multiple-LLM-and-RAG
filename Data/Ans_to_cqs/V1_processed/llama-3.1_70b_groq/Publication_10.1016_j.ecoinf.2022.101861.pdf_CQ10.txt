I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to bird research, citizen science, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
