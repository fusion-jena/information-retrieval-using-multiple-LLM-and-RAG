Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data preprocessing, transformation, and modeling stages, but does not provide information on the data collection process.

It mentions the use of "comprehensive datasets" but does not elaborate on how these datasets were collected. It also mentions the use of techniques such as MinMaxScaler and LabelEncoder for data transformation, but these are not related to data collection.

Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
