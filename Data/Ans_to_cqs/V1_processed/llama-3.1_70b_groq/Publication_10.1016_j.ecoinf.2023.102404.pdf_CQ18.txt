The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the grid search method was used to optimize the model's hyperparameters, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the evaluation metric to assess the model's performance. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored and evaluated using cross-validation techniques, but the specific details of the strategy are not provided.
