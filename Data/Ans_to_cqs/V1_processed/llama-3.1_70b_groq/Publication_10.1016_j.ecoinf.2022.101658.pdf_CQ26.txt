The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it does mention that the study employed data augmentation strategies to increase the training set size fourfold, which can help alleviate class-imbalance issues. The data augmentation strategies used were:

1. Horizontal flip
2. Gaussian noise addition
3. Contrast reduction

The contrast reduction strategy was specifically motivated by the application, as it helps to simulate areas of low lighting which can be expected in the dataset. This can help reduce bias towards overrepresented classes.

It's worth noting that the context mentions that the deep learning method's loss function is biased toward overrepresented classes, which represents a performance barrier for the study. However, it does not provide information on other techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
