The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few datasets related to insect images, including:

* Pest24: a large-scale dataset of agricultural pests for multi-target detection (Wang et al., 2020)
* STARdbi: a dataset of annotated insect images, although it is noted that it only encompasses a tiny fraction of insect diversity

It also mentions that the pipeline uses a classification model (ResNet152) and that the authors aim to periodically replace the networks with new state-of-the-art ones as better algorithms are released.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, but some related datasets are mentioned, including Pest24 and STARdbi.
