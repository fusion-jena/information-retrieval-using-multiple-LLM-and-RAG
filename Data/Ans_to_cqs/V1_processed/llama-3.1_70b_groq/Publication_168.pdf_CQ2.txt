The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely hyperspectral image (HSI) data. The context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for HSI classification, which suggests that the input data is in the form of images. Additionally, the context mentions the use of 3-D convolutional kernels, which further supports the idea that the data format is image-based. However, the exact format of the image data (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, etc.) is not specified.
