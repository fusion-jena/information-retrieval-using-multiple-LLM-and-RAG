Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of the model's hyperparameters using a grid search approach and the evaluation of the model's performance using cross-validation techniques. It also mentions the winning parameters for the model, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
