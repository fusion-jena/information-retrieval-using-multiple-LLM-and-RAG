The provided context does not explicitly mention the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. However, it does mention that the regression hyperparameter tuning has been performed for all nine prediction models, and the best regression parameter has been used for training the model. Additionally, it mentions that the hyperparameters were adjusted according to the selection criteria to determine the most appropriate configuration for the prediction model, and that a 5-fold cross-validation was used for parameter selection. 

Therefore, while we can't pinpoint the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization, it appears that some form of systematic search and evaluation was employed, possibly with the aid of cross-validation.
