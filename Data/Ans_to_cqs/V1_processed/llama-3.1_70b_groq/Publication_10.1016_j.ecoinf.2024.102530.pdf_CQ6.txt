Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model for Apis suitability, using data from a field survey and literature, and implemented using the fuzzy logic toolbox of Matlab 2023b.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model, as it is not related to the provided context.
