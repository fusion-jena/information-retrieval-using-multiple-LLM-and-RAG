I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling using ensemble modeling approaches, including regression-based and machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM). The text mentions the use of the BIOMOD2 package in R, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the modeling process.
