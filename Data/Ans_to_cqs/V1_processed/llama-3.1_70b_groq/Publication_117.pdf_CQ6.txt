The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does describe the process of generating a training dataset and preparing the images for object detection.

According to the context, the images were tiled into 864 Ã— 864 subimages and then passed through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. This process created a list of the locations of potential objects in each image. The results were then filtered by discarding any object detections that did not correspond to an identification from the Zooniverse data.

While this information does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps, it suggests that the images were divided into smaller subimages and possibly used with pre-trained weights, which may have included some form of normalization or scaling. However, the exact preprocessing steps involved are not specified in the provided context.
