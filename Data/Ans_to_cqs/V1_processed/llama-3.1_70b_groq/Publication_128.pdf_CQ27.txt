Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the model training process, including the parameters and functions used, the neural network models designed, and the computational resources and environment used. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
