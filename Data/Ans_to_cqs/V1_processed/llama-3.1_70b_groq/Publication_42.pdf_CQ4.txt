The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Flip vertical: This involves flipping the images vertically to create new training data.
2. Flip horizontal: This involves flipping the images horizontally to create new training data.
3. Zoom: This involves zooming in or out of the images to create new training data.
4. Different illumination intensity: This involves changing the brightness or contrast of the images to create new training data.
5. Rotation of different degrees: This involves rotating the images by different angles to create new training data.

These data augmentation techniques were applied to all images in the dataset to create a uniform distribution of species and to increase the number of training data points. The dataset was scaled with a factor of 32 times, resulting in 72,000 images, where each class contained 8000 data points after augmentation.
