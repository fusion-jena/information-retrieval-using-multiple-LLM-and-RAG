The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is prediction, specifically for forecasting vegetation responses to extreme drought using Earth observation data. The models mentioned, such as ConvLSTM and Channel-U-Net, are designed for predictive tasks, aiming to forecast future vegetation health and land surface dynamics.
