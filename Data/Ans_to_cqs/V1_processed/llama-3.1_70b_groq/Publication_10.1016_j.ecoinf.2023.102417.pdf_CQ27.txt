Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the importance of training data, data drift, domain adaptation, and the training process of deep learning models. It does not discuss model deployment, model serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
