Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on object detection using CNNs, feature maps, anchor boxes, and the challenges of detecting small objects in UAV thermal images. It also discusses the dataset distribution and the division of images into subsets based on the number of deer in each image.

However, it does mention that the dataset is divided into separate subsets based on the number of deer in each image, and within each subset, the images are further partitioned into three sections using a ratio of 75:15:15. This suggests that some form of data partitioning or stratification is employed to address the issue of unbalanced data distribution, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
