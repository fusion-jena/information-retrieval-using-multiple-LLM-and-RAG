I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study that uses remote sensing data, specifically NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets, to analyze vegetation health. The study uses various datasets, including MODIS NDVI, CDR AVHRR NDVI, and GIMMS NDVI, and utilizes the Google Earth Engine platform for data processing. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
