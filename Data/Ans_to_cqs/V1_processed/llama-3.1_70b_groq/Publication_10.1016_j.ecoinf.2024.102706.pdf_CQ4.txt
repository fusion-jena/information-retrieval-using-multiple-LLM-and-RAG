Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, and its unique features, such as leaf-wise splitting and Gradient-Based One Side Sampling (GBOSS). It also mentions the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
