Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions a "benthic organism dataset" used in an experiment, but it does not provide more information about this dataset or other datasets that might be used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to this question.
