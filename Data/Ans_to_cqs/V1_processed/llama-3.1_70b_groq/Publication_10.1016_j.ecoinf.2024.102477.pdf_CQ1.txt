Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references related to deep learning, air pollution analysis, and other topics, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that some of the studies may have used sensors or public datasets for collecting data. For example, the study by Lawin et al. (2017) mentions the use of exhaled carbon monoxide as a non-invasive biomarker of short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution, which may involve collecting data from sensors or other devices. Additionally, the study by Ji et al. (2021) mentions the use of SAR data for estimating forest above-ground biomass, which may involve collecting data from remote sensing technologies.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the answer to this question is that it is not possible to determine the methods used for collecting raw data based on the provided context.
