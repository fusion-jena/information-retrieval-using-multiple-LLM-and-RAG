The criteria used to determine when training is complete are based on two factors: correct identification rate and processing time. The correct identification rate improves up to a certain point and then reaches a plateau, beyond which there is no significant improvement. The processing time, on the other hand, shows a positive linear relationship with the number of training steps. The optimum number of training steps is determined by finding the point where the gap between the processing time and identification rate is the largest. In the case of the Mexican dataset, this optimum number of training steps was found to be 2,000, resulting in an 83.0% overall identification rate.
