I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It discusses the use of machine learning models such as random forest (RF), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and support vector regression (SVR) for predicting algal-related parameters, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training these models.
