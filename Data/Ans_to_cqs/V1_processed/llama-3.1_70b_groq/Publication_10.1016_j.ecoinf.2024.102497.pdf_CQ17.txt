Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on bathymetry retrieval methods, including linear regression, CART, and Random Forest regression, but does not delve into deep learning techniques or regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
