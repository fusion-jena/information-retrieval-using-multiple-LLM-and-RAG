The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions that the study used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to classify land cover/land use (LCLU) changes in the Talassemtane National Park (TNP). The context also mentions that the study used a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model incorporating five spectral indices to differentiate six land use classes. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
