The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the data is likely in the form of audio, as the context mentions "dolphin sounds", "dolphin calls", and "whistle". The fact that the data is being processed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and that the models are being trained on spectrograms (implied by the mention of "window size" and "dpi") also suggests that the data is audio-based. However, the exact format of the audio data (e.g., WAV, MP3, etc.) is not specified.
