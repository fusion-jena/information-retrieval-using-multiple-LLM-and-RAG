Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their architectures, and their performance on small datasets. It also mentions the use of XGBoost for Fv/Fm parameter estimation, but it does not delve into the preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial for training deep learning models. These steps help to prepare the data for training by reducing the impact of dominant features, improving model convergence, and removing noise or irrelevant information.

Since the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I cannot provide a more detailed answer. If you have any further questions or need more information on a different topic, feel free to ask!
