Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) to acquire training samples and validate the FIREMAP burned area product, as well as the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for high-performance computing and remote sensing data analysis. It does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
