Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on soil science, irrigation, and visualization tools, with some mentions of machine learning and node-based programming. However, it does not provide information on specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
