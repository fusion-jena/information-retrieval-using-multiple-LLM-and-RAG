To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors employed cross-validation and training-test splits of the time series. Specifically, they used k-fold cross-validation to choose the values of certain hyperparameters, such as m, d*, cluster, and Î±, in order to optimize the accuracy of the method. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is able to generalize well to unseen data.

Additionally, the authors used a training-test split of the time series, where 50% of the data was used for training and the remaining 50% was used for testing. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and provides a more realistic estimate of its generalizability.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context. However, the use of cross-validation and training-test splits suggests that the authors took steps to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
