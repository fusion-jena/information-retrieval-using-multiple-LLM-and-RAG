The provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, based on the mentioned applications and related works, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for prediction tasks.

The context mentions the use of deep learning algorithms to obtain "deeply hidden characteristic information and features" which suggests that the model is used for extracting complex patterns and relationships in data. Additionally, the comparison between the BPNN model and the SVM model is conducted to seek a more suitable prediction model for the EF ( likely referring to Environmental Footprint), which implies that the deep learning model is used for prediction tasks.

Some of the related works mentioned in the context, such as predicting distribution of invasive tree species, estimating daily global solar radiation, and predicting mosquito abundances, also suggest that the deep learning model is used for prediction tasks. However, the specific purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection, is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
