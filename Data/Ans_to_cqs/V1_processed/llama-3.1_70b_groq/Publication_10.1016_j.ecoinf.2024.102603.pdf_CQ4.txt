Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their architectures, and their applications, but it does not delve into specific data augmentation techniques.

However, it does mention that deep learning models can handle both structured and unstructured data, such as images and text. This suggests that data augmentation techniques might be applicable in certain deep learning pipelines, but the specific techniques used are not specified in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
