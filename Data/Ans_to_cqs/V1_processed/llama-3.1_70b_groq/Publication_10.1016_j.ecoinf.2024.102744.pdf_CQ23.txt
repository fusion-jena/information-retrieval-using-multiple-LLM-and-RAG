Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics, comparison of different methods, and the architecture of the proposed model. It does not provide information on the dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques used to ensure the model's generalizability.

However, it can be inferred that the model was evaluated on a specific dataset (VnPollenBee dataset), and its performance was compared with other state-of-the-art methods. This suggests that the model was tested on a specific dataset, but it does not provide information on the dataset's diversity or the techniques used to ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
