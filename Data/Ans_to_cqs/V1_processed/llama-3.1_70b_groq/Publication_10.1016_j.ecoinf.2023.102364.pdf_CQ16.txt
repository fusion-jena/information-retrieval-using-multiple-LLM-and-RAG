Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text discusses the use of machine learning ensembles and various algorithms, but it does not provide details on the specific stopping criteria or convergence conditions used to determine when the training process is complete.

However, it is mentioned that the authors used Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) v8.3 to train the ensemble of machine learning models. It is possible that the software has built-in default settings or options for determining when training is complete, but this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this case.
