Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the model architecture (SegFormer) and its components (e.g., MiT encoder, ALL-MLP decoder), as well as the optimizer (AdamW) and loss function (Cross-Entropy) used for training. However, it does not provide information on the underlying framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
