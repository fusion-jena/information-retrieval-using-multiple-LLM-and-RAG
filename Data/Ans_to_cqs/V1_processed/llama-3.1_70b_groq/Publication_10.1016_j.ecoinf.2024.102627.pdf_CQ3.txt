Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the model architecture, species assemblage prediction, and deep learning framework, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
