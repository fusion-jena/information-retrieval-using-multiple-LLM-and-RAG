Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), their architecture, and optimization objectives. It does not discuss randomness or strategies for managing it in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of probabilistic encoders and decoders in VAEs, which inherently involve randomness. The encoder maps the input to a posterior density over the latent variable, and the decoder reconstructs the input data from the latent variable. This process involves sampling from the posterior density, which introduces randomness. Nevertheless, the context does not provide information on how to handle or manage this randomness.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
