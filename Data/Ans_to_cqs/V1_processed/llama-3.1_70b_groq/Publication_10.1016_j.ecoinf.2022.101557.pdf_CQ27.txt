Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including data pre-processing, model architecture, and post-processing of the results. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
