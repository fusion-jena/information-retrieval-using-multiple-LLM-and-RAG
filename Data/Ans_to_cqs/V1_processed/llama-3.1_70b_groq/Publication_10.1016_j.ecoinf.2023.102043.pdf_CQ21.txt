Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to focus on the data collection and annotation process, as well as the functionality of a system for monitoring and correcting event predictions. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
