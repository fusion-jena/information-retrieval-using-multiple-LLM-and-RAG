Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on soil science, environmental modeling, and data visualization, with some references to machine learning and remote sensing. However, it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

While some of the references mention data visualization and analysis, they do not provide information on data annotation techniques. For example, the paper by Isikdogan et al. (2017) discusses an automated river analysis and mapping engine, but it does not mention data annotation techniques. Similarly, the paper by Jarray et al. (2022) discusses a web-based tool for soil moisture estimation, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
