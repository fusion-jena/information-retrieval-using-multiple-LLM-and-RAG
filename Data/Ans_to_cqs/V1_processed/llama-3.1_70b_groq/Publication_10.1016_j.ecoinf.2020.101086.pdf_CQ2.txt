Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental modeling, species distribution, and factor analysis, but it does not mention deep learning or specific data formats.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used in the environmental modeling pipeline may include numerical and categorical variables, which could be stored in formats such as CSV or other tabular data formats. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD), which are typically applied to tabular data.

But, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact data formats used in the pipeline.
