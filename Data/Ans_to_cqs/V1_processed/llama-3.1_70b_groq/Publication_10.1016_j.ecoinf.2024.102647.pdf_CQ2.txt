Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the pipeline is used for soil salinity distribution mapping and analysis, which suggests that the input data may be in the form of satellite imagery or remote sensing data.

The context mentions the use of "satellite imagery" in one of the references (Ghazali et al., 2020), which suggests that image data may be used as input to the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions the use of variables such as "Normalized difference salinity index (NDSI)" and "Land cover (LC)", which are commonly derived from remote sensing data.

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to determine the specific data formats used in the pipeline. It is possible that the pipeline also uses other data formats, such as CSV files for storing and processing tabular data.

Therefore, based on the available information, the answer to the query is that the pipeline likely uses image data, possibly in the form of satellite imagery or remote sensing data, but the exact data formats used are not specified.
