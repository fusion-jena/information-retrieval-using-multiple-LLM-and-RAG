The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search approach. According to the text, "The present study employed a hyperparameter tuning methodology utilizing grid search to obtain the optimal values of various hyper-parameter in order to improve the model(s) performance." This suggests that the researchers used a grid search technique to systematically explore different combinations of hyperparameters and evaluate their impact on the model's performance.
