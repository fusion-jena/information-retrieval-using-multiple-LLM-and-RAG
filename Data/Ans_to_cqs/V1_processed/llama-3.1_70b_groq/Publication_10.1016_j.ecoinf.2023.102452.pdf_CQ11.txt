I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and references related to ecological informatics, machine learning, and genetic programming, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
