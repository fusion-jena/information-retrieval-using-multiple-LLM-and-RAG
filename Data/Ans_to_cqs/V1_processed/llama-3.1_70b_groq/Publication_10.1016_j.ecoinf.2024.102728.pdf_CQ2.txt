Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The papers and sources mentioned focus on topics such as object retrieval with deep convolutional networks, aerial scene classification, and feature extraction in remote sensing. These applications typically involve working with image data.

Specifically, the paper by Petrovska et al. (2020) discusses the use of deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing, which involves analyzing aerial images. The paper by Mohedano et al. (2017) focuses on object retrieval with deep convolutional networks, which also involves image data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of orthophotos with a 12.5 cm resolution, which suggests that high-resolution image data is being used.

There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not explicitly mentioned either, but it is possible that they might be used for storing or processing metadata related to the image data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
