Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on water quality assessment using machine learning approaches, but it does not provide information on the data formats used. The context mentions the use of data splitting ratios, training and testing datasets, and various research studies, but it does not specify the format of the data used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
