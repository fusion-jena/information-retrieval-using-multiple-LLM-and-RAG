The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, which suggests that the primary data format is likely to be image data, specifically multispectral or hyperspectral remote sensing images. Additionally, the context mentions the use of spectral indices, which are typically calculated from the image data and may be stored in a format such as CSV or a similar tabular format. However, the exact data formats used in the pipeline are not specified.
