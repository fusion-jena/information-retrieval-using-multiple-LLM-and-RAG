The method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of drone imagery and remote sensing. The text does not provide further details on the specific sensors or equipment used, but it mentions that drone imagery is used to collect data on Pacific oysters in their natural habitat. The data is then split into tiles, with some tiles containing Pacific oysters and others without, to create a dataset for training and validation.
