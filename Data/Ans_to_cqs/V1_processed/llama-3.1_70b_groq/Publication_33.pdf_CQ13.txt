Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the calibration of the model using a single parameter for all classes, the use of a risk threshold, and the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN). It also mentions the use of a second and independent database for tuning the risk threshold, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used during training.

However, the context does mention the use of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, as referenced in [43. Abadi, M. et al. Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning. OSDI 16, 265â€“283 (2016)]. This suggests that the model may have been implemented using TensorFlow, but the specific hyperparameters used are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
