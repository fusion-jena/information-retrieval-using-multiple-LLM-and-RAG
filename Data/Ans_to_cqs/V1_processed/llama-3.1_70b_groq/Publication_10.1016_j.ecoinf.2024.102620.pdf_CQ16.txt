Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the PLUS model, its components, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the accuracy of predictions, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient, RMSE, and MAPE. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
