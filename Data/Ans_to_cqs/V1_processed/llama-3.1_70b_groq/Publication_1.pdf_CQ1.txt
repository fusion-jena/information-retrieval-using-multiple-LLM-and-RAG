According to the provided context, raw data are collected using regional sensor networks. These sensors can include audio recorders for collecting bird vocalizations and cameras for tracking populations of invasive snakes. The sensors can generate large amounts of data, such as 16-bit stereo audio at a moderate sample rate of 22,000 samples per second (22 kHz) or 2048-by-1536 8-bit 4:2:2 color images taken at least once every thirty seconds. The data are often collected with a 30% duty cycle over each day, and light (lossless or near-lossless) data compression is employed. 

It is also mentioned that this approach helps to alleviate the sampling, variability, and bias problems associated with traditional surveys. However, the context does not provide information on the use of public datasets in the deep learning pipeline.
