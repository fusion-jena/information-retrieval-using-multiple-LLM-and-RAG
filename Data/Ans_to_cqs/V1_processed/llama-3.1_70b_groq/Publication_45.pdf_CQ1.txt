Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the complete data set is available online (Seidl et al., 2015) and that more information on the dataset as well as statistical analyses of the data are provided by Seidl et al. (2016). 

It also mentions that the data set has a high spatial resolution over an area of 13,319 ha, which suggests that the data may have been collected using remote sensing or other spatially explicit methods. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact methods used for collecting the raw data.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of bark beetle outbreaks in conifer-forests as an example for designing, training, and applying deep neural networks for ecological prediction. This suggests that the data may have been collected through a combination of field observations, remote sensing, and other methods, but the exact methods are not specified.
