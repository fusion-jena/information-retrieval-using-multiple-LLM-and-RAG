Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the model optimization process, including hyperparameter tuning and the selection of the optimal model architecture. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
