The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on a study that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for species distribution modeling (SDM) in the Himalayas, specifically for the Rhododendron arboreum species. The study uses satellite-based observations and ecological data, but it does not mention the use of any of the commonly known deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
