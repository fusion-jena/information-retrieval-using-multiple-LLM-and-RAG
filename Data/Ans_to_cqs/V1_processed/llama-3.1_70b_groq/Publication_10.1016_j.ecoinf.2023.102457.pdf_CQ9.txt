I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of pre-trained models such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, and mentions various studies that have used deep learning for bioacoustics applications, but it does not provide information on where the data repository for the pipeline is hosted.
