Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The section on "Data collection" (2.1) is mentioned, but its contents are not provided. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular study.

However, I can provide some general information on common methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. These may include surveys, sensors, public datasets, and others such as crowdsourcing, web scraping, or data purchased from third-party providers. In the context of the provided references, it appears that the study may be related to acoustic data, possibly collected using sensors or recording devices. For example, the reference by Allen et al. (2021) mentions a "long-term passive acoustic dataset", suggesting that the data may have been collected using underwater sensors or recording devices. However, without more information, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
