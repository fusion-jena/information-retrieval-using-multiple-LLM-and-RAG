Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on land use change modeling, scenario simulation, and ecosystem services, with some mentions of specific models such as LSTM, Markov chain, and PLUS. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

That being said, in general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data
* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1
* Feature scaling: scaling features to have similar magnitudes to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data augmentation: generating additional training data through transformations such as rotation, flipping, and cropping
* Encoding categorical variables: converting categorical variables into numerical representations that can be processed by the model

However, without specific information from the context, it is unclear what preprocessing steps are involved in the particular deep learning models mentioned.
