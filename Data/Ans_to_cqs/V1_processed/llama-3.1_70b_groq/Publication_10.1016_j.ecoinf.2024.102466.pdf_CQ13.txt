Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rate and optimizer. The text only discusses the performance of different object detection models (e.g., Cascade RCNN, Faster RCNN, ATSS, RepPoint, FCOS, Sparse RCNN) on camera trap images, but does not provide details on the hyperparameters used for training these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
