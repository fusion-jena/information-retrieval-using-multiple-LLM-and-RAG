The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training process takes approximately 11.5 hours and converges after 65 K iterations, suggesting that the model's performance is monitored through the convergence of the training loss. Additionally, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function is used to supervise the training of TrunkNet, which measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Minimizing this difference indicates a better training effect.
