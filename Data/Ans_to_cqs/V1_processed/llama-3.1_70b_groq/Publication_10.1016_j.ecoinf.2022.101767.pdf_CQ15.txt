Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be related to a study on YouTube videos about wild birds, and it mentions the use of a wrapper feature selection algorithm working with random forest analysis to identify important factors explaining the number of views in each video. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
