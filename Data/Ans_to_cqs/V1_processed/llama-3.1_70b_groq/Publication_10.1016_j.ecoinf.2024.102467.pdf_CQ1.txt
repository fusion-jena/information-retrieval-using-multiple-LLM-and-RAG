Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically the BoTNet and Faster R-CNN algorithms, for object detection and classification tasks in the field of ecological informatics and aquaculture. It mentions the use of high-resolution images, but it does not provide information on how these images were collected.

However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that the data may have been collected through various means such as:

* Surveys: Claudet and Fraschetti (2010) mention a regional meta-analysis in the Mediterranean Sea, which may have involved surveys to collect data on marine habitats.
* Public datasets: The context mentions the use of a benthic organism dataset, which may be a publicly available dataset.
* Sensors: Although not explicitly mentioned, sensors may have been used to collect data on aquatic animals, as mentioned in Duan et al. (2015).

However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question.
