Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on forest fire danger prediction, discussing data layers, weighting approaches, and technical implementation, but it does not touch on deep learning pipelines or data bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
