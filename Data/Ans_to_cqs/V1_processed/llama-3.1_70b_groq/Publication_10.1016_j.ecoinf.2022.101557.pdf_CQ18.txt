The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation set. According to the text, "A validation set is used to monitor the model performance during training. These samples are selected randomly from all areas that are used in the training set, and are never used to fit the model." This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated on a separate set of data, not used for training, to monitor its performance and prevent overfitting.
