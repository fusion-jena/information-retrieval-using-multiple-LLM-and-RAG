Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the architecture of the neural network (30-20-10), the activation functions (tansig, tansig, and purelin), and the data split for training, validation, and testing (70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively). It does not provide information on the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters used in the model.
