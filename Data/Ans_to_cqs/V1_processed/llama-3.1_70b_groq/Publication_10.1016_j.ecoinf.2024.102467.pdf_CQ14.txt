Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the comparison of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms, its detection efficiency, and its lightweight nature, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
