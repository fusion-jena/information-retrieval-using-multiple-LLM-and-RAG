According to the provided context, the performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy: This is the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances in the dataset.
2. F1-score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, such as TabPFN, AutoGluon, XGBoost, and RF. For example, TabPFN achieved an accuracy of 91% and an F1-score of 93%, while AutoGluon achieved an accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 93%.
