I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to biodiversity, conservation, and ecology, with references to various research papers and studies. However, there is no mention of a specific data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
