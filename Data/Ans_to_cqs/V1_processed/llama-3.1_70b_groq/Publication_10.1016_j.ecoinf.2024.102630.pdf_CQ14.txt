I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters or the use of a model that requires hyperparameter tuning. The context appears to be discussing the use of the Jenks natural breaks optimization method for classifying NDVI data, but it does not provide information on how hyperparameters are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
