Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically for the DeepLabV3+ architecture. However, it does mention that the model uses the TensorFlow framework and that the training parameters used for training a model with DeepLabV3+ can be seen in Table 1.

Table 1 provides information about the training parameters, such as the learning policy, base learning rate, and batch size, but it does not mention any preprocessing steps. It does mention that the model uses a pre-trained model as a starting point and fine-tunes the weights with further training, but it does not provide information about any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the data before training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model using the DeepLabV3+ architecture.
