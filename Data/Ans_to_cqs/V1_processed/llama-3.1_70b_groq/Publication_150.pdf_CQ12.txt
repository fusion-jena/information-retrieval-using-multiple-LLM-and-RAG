The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be inferred from the models mentioned in the context, such as ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1, which are all variants of CNN architectures. These models are designed for image classification tasks and are trained on large-scale image databases like ImageNet. The use of techniques like batch normalization, stochastic gradient descent optimizer, and factorized convolution also supports the conclusion that CNNs are being used in the pipeline.
