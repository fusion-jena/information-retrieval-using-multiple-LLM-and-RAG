The provided context does not mention the use of popular deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions the creation of a custom dataset for cactus recognition in aerial images, specifically in the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley in Mexico. The context also mentions the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which has over 330,000 images, but it does not indicate that COCO is used in the deep learning pipeline for cactus recognition.
