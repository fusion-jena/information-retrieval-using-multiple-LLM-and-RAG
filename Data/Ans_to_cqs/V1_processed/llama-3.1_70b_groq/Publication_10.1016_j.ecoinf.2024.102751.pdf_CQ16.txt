Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, soil science, and remote sensing, and does not provide information on machine learning training processes.

However, it is mentioned that "Exploring machine learning algorithms could further improve predictive power and uncover hidden relationships within the dataset." This suggests that machine learning is relevant to the topic, but the specific details on training completion criteria are not provided.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
