Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to improve the delineation of the skyline in semantic segmentation tasks, and the application of this approach to estimate distances to trees on landscape photos. It does not discuss randomness or random seed values in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
