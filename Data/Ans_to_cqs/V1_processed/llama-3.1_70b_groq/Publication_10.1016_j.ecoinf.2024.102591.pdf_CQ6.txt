The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the training dataset was incorporated as an asset in GEE (Google Earth Engine) and that atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2 A scenes were used.

It can be inferred that some level of preprocessing was performed on the data, as it is mentioned that the data was "atmospherically corrected" and "harmonized". However, the specific preprocessing steps involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions that the PROSAIL-D RTM inversion was performed to retrieve the FCOVER from post-fire S2 scenes, and that the RF regression algorithm was used to build relationships between the FCOVER and the corresponding reflectance in the S2 band configuration. However, the preprocessing steps involved in these processes are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, while it can be inferred that some level of preprocessing was performed, the specific steps involved are not mentioned in the provided context.
