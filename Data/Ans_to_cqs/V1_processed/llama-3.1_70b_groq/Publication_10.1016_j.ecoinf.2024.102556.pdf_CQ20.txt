The text does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the hardware used for image processing, which is the Jetson AGX Xavier-embedded computing system from NVIDIA. This system features an NVIDIA Volta GPU with 512 CUDA cores and an 8-core ARMv8.2 CPU. It is likely that this system was used for inference or deployment of the model, but it is not clear if it was also used for training.
