Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to data analysis of vocalisations, specifically song structures, and mentions issues with localisation accuracy, but does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and assist further.
