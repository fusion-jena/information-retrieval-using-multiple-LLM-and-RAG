Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning in agriculture, smart farming, and plant phenological research, as well as the challenges and limitations of current frameworks.

However, it does mention the importance of developing cost-effective models that are robust to noise and variability, and the need for emerging smart farming initiatives to be supported by a new perspective in artificial intelligence research. It also touches on the use of Bayesian deep learning models and probabilistic deep learning, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
