Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, soil mapping, and land use classification using machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
