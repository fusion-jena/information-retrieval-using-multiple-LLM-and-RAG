The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of TensorBoard, a set of visualization tools included in the open-source library for machine learning TensorFlow. According to the text, TensorBoard was used to study the performance of the runs, allowing the researchers to track the model's performance and identify the best validation run. Additionally, the model's performance was validated every 300 iterations, which helped to monitor its progress and adjust the parameters as needed.
