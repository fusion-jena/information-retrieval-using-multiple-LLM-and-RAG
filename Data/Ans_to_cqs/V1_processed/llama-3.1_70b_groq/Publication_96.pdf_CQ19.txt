The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Google Cloud computing and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, but it does not provide information on the specific framework used to implement the DNN models. Therefore, I do not know which framework was used to build the deep learning model.
