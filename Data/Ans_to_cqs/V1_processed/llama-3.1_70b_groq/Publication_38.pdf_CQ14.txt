Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the architecture of the CNN model, the input size, and the application of the model in a sliding window fashion, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
