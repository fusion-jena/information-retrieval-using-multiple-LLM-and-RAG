The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the context, it appears that the model is being used for regression, specifically to predict the Total Suspended Solids (TSI) in water samples. The model is trained on a dataset of water samples with corresponding TSI values, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The goal of the model is to accurately predict TSI values based on input features such as aCDOM(254) and Fn(355).
