Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text discusses the application of machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
