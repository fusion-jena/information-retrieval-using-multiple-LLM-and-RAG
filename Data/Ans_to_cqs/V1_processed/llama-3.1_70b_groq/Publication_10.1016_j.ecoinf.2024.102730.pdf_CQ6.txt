Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of machine learning models, specifically multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), for predicting vegetation phenology characteristics, and the evaluation metrics used to assess their performance. It also discusses the use of SHAP values to understand the importance of features in predicting the start and peak of the greening season.

However, it does mention that the data was divided into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data) before conducting the grid search to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. This suggests that some form of data splitting was performed, but it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in this context.
