I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. It mentions the use of machine learning techniques to classify fire-damaged monuments and the success in identifying minor fires, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
