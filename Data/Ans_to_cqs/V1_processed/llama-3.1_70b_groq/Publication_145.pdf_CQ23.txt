Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It does mention that the validation dataset and the model segmented 1195 objects, but it does not provide information on how the dataset was split, whether cross-validation was used, or if the dataset was diverse and representative of the problem domain.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a relatively large dataset, as it was trained for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch. This suggests that the dataset may have been substantial, but without more information, it is impossible to determine if the dataset was diverse, representative, or if techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question of what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
