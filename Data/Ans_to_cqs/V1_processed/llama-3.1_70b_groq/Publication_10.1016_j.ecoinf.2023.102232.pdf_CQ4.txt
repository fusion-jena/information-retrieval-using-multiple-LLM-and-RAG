I don't know. The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing a different topic, specifically a hybrid algorithm that combines a Least Squares (LS) algorithm with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for parameter estimation. The context mentions the use of a database, Python scripts, and a scientific computing centre, but does not mention data augmentation techniques or deep learning.
