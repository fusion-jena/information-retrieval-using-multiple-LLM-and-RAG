The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water. Specifically, the models discussed, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and SVR (Support Vector Regression), are used for regression tasks, aiming to estimate the DO concentration based on various input variables, including water quality parameters, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The goal is to improve the accuracy of DO concentration prediction, addressing issues like poor generalization ability, local optimum, underfitting, and overfitting of conventional models.
