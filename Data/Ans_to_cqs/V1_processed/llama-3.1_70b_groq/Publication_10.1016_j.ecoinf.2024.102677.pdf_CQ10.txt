I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic references and citations related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and deep learning, but it does not include any information about a specific code repository or pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
