Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in remote sensing and environmental monitoring, particularly in estimating carbon stocks and biomass.

The context mentions the use of multispectral and SAR data, as well as specific satellite sensors such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
