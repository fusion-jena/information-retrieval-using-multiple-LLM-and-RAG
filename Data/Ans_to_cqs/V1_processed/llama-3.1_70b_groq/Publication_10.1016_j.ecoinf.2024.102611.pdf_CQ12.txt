Based on the provided context, it appears that various deep learning models have been used for plant species identification, including:

* CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Azadnia et al. (2022) used a deep CNN based on global average pooling for medicinal plant identification.
* VGG-16: Barhate et al. (2023) used VGG-16 with dimensionality reduction using ESPCA to classify thirty-two plant species.
* ResNet-50: Ganguly et al. (2022) used the ResNet-50 architecture to capture leaf feature patterns via fusion learning.

However, it is not clear which specific deep learning model is used in the pipeline being referred to in the query, as the context does not provide information on a specific pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
