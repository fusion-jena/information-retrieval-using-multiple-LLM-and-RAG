The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the performance of the reclassification model, the selection of training sites, and the evaluation of the model's accuracy. However, it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during the training process.

The context does mention that the combined approach resulted in an improvement in mining detection accuracy from 72% to 89.5%, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated after training. However, the specific strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training is not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
