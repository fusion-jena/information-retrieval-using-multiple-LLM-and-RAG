The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of camera traps for wildlife monitoring, which suggests that camera trap images are one source of raw data. Additionally, the context mentions aerial survey images, which could be another source of raw data. 

It is also mentioned that the study was conducted in Maine, USA, from January to September 2022, using three tagging methods, including one with ML bounding box assistance. This implies that the raw data may have been collected through a combination of camera traps and aerial surveys. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
