Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the performance of the models trained with different annotation sets, the importance of clear task description and estimation of task difficulty, and the hyperparameters used for training. It also mentions the use of evaluation metrics such as AUC and mAP, but does not provide details on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
