Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only describes the architecture of the convolutional neural network, including its various layers and their functions, but does not provide information about the frameworks or tools used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
