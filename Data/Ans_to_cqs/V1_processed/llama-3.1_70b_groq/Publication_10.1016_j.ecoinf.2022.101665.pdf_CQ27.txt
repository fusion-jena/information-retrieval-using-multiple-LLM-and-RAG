I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to machine learning, geostatistics, and data analysis, but it does not provide information on the specific process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context mentions topics such as data splitting, model evaluation, and accuracy assessment, but it does not touch on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
