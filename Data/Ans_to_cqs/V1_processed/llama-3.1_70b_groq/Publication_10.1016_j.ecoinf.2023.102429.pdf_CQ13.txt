Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the SVM model was performed in MATLAB R2016a using the libsvm package, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Additionally, the context mentions other machine learning models such as Random Forest, LASSO, and CNN, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models either. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
