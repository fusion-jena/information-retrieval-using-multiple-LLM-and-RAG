I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to environmental science and ecology, discussing topics such as carbon exchange models, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange. It does not provide any information about deep learning or machine learning techniques. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
