Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on deep learning models, architectures, and techniques, such as MobileNetV2, ResNet18, VGG16, and attention mechanisms. It also mentions data preprocessing and augmentation, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

However, it is possible to make an educated guess based on the context. The mention of "image data augmentation" and "image recognition" suggests that the dataset may consist of images. In this case, common methods for collecting raw image data include:

* Public datasets (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-10)
* Crowdsourcing (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk)
* Web scraping
* Sensors (e.g., cameras, drones)
* Surveys or data collection campaigns

However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
