I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text discusses the use of a deep neural network for fish biomass estimation, but it does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used in the model. It only reports the performance metrics of the model, such as RMSE, MRE, and R2, but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used to train the model.
