Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for feature extraction and compares the training times and validation accuracies of different ResNet variants. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I do not know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
