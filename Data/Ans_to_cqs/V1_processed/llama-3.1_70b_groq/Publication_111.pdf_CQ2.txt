The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a numerical format, possibly in CSV or a similar format, as the task involves predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) values. The use of machine learning and deep learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), also suggests that the data is numerical in nature. There is no indication of the use of image, audio, or video data formats in the pipeline.
