Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study involving ecological informatics, data sources, and spatial resolution, but it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
