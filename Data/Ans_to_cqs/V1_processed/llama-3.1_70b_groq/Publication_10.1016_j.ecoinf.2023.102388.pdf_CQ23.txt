To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. According to the provided context, the following techniques were used to prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization:

1. **Batch normalization**: This technique was used to normalize the input data for each layer, which helps to reduce the effect of internal covariate shift and improve the stability of the model.
2. **Dropout**: A dropout rate of 0.5 was used to randomly drop out neurons during training, which helps to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron or group of neurons.
3. **Weight decay**: A weight decay of 0.5 was used to add a penalty term to the loss function for large weight values, which helps to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.
4. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: The optimization algorithm used was SGD, which is a stochastic optimization algorithm that helps to prevent overfitting by adding noise to the gradient updates.
5. **Learning rate**: A learning rate of 0.0001 was used, which is a relatively small learning rate that helps to prevent the model from overshooting the optimal solution.
6. **Batch size**: A batch size of 32 was used, which is a relatively small batch size that helps to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.

These measures were taken to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or using a diverse dataset were used.
