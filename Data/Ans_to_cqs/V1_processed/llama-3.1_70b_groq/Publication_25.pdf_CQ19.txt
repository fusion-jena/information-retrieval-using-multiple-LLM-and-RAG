The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it does mention the use of a "resnet-50 classification backbone that was pretrained on the ImageNet dataset." This suggests that the model is built using a framework that supports the use of pre-trained models and backbones, but the specific framework is not specified.
