Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context only discusses the configuration of parameters for the Random Forest (RF) training and the architecture of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.
