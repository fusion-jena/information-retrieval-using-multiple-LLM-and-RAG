I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses various topics such as stochastic gradient descent, embedding layers, natural language processing, and wireless sensor networks, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
