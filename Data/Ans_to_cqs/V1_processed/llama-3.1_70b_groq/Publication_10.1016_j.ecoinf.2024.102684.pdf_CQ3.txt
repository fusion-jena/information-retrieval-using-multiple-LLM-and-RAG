Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, semantic segmentation, and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and segmentation tasks.

However, it does mention that CNNs can be used for different tasks, including classification, regression, object detection, and semantic- and instance-based segmentation. Additionally, it mentions the use of the UNet model for semantic segmentation, but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query, as the context does not provide sufficient information on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
