Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict algal-related parameters, such as chlorophyll-a, and to monitor and predict Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). The datasets mentioned in the context are related to water quality parameters and ecosystem variables, but they are not the typical datasets used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
