Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, acoustic monitoring, and audio signal processing, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

However, it does mention the use of acoustic indices for ecological monitoring and the importance of reducing device bias in recording devices to enhance the applicability of these indices. It also mentions the potential extension of these indices to fields like machine learning and deep learning, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
