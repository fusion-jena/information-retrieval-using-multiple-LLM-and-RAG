Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and evaluation metrics, but it does not discuss deep learning models or their preprocessing steps.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. These may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model stability and convergence.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing duplicates, handling outliers, and imputing missing values.
* Feature engineering: transforming and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data.

Please note that these are general preprocessing steps, and the specific steps required may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.
