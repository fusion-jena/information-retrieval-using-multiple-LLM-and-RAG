The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of underwater videos as a source of data for estimating fish biomass. It is stated that "By using underwater videos, it is possible to detect the fish present and estimate their size, which can then be used to calculate the total biomass."

Additionally, the context mentions the use of images of fish in the dataset, but it does not provide information on how these images were collected. It is possible that the images were obtained through underwater cameras or other sensors, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only method that can be inferred for collecting raw data is the use of underwater videos. However, it is likely that other methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets may also be used, but this information is not provided in the context.
