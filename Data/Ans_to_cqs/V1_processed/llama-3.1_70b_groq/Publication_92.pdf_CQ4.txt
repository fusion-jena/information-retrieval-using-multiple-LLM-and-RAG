Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture of the network, the use of inception layers, and the post-processing and bounding box fusion techniques, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
