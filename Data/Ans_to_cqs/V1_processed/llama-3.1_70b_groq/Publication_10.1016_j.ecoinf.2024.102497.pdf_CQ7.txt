Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the use of CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models for predicting water depths, but it does not delve into the details of data splitting for deep learning model training.

However, it does mention that the CART model was fine-tuned by adjusting parameters such as 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes' to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error. This suggests that cross-validation may have been used to evaluate the model's performance, but the specific criteria used to split the data are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
