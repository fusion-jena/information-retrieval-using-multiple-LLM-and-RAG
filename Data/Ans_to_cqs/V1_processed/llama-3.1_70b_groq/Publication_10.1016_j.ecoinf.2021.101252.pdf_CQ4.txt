Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily discusses the AutoML procedure, which involves generating candidate models with random architectures and hyperparameters, training them on a small subset of data, and selecting the best-performing model. It also presents the results of three case studies, showing the accuracy of candidate models and the predictive performance of selected models.

While data augmentation is an important technique in deep learning, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
