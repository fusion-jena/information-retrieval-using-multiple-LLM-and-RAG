Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors and Decision Trees, and the evaluation metrics used to assess their performance. It also mentions the use of stratiÔ¨Åed cross-validation and the importance of variable selection. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
