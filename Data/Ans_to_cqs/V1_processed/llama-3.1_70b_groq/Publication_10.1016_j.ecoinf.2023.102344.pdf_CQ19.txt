Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It only discusses the architectures of the models, such as ResNet101, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and EfficientNet-B0, but does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement them. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
