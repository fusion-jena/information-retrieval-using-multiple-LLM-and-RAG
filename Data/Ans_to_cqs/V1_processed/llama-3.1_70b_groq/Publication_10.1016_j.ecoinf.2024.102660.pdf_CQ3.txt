Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the Res_AUNet network was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, but it does not provide details on how the data was annotated. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
