The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through a process of testing several values for the k-NN classifier, and selecting the value that yields the best performance. Specifically, the value of k is fixed at k = 4, as this value resulted in the best performance after testing. For the CNN spectrogram classifier, the hyperparameters are tuned using the validation set. However, the exact method of hyperparameter optimization (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified in the provided context.
