Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization techniques, model training, and performance improvement. It discusses the use of Keras Tuner and its algorithms, such as Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization, for hyperparameter optimization. However, it does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
