I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to data integration, citation, and management in the field of ecological informatics, specifically in the context of the ESS-DIVE repository and projects such as AmeriFlux. There is no mention of deep learning models or frameworks, so I am unable to provide an answer to this question.
