The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does discuss the process of active learning, which involves selecting a small, randomly chosen labelled subset of data to start with, and then iteratively adding more labelled samples to the training set.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Common practices include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into random subsets for training, testing, and validation.
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on class labels or other relevant factors to ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of classes.
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k subsets and using each subset as a test set once, while using the remaining subsets as training data.

However, these specific criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.
