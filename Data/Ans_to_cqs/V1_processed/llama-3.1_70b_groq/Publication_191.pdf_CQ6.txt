Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, parameter settings, and dataset information. It does not provide details on data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the context mentions training a model using the Caffe framework and employing a fixed learning policy. Typically, deep learning models require some form of preprocessing to prepare the data for training. But without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a specific answer.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
