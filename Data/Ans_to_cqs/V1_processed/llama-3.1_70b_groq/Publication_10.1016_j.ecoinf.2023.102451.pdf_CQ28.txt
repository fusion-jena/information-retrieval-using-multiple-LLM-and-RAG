I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the operating system (MAC OS), processor (Apple M1-Chip), and development environment (TensorFlow 2.2.0, Keras 2.4.0) used for training and testing the model, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
