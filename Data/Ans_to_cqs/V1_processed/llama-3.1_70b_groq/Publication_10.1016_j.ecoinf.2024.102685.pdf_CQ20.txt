Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and seagrass research, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the given context.
