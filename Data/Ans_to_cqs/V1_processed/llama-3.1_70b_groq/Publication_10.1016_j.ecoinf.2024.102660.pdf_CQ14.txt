Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the parameter settings used for the Res_AUNet network, such as the batch size, initial learning rate, and learning rate adjustment strategy (StepLR). However, it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were chosen or optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
