The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on a framework for controlling error rates in deep learning algorithms for ecology applications, particularly in species classification. It discusses the use of confidence thresholds to post-process the outputs of deep learning algorithms and reduce misclassification rates.

However, it does mention the use of two independent databases, T0 and T1, for training the classification model and tuning the risk thresholds, respectively. This could potentially help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process, but it is not explicitly stated as a strategy for handling randomness.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values.
