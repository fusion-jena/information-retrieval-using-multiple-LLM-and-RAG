Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the supervised learning workflow, data collection, and classification of land cover using Google Earth Engine. It discusses the preparation of training and validation datasets, the division of data into 'non-woody' and 'woody' cover classes, and the use of random forest classification. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
