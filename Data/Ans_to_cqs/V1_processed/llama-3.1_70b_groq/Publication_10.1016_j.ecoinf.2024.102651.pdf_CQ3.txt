I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of different deep learning architectures, such as CNN, ViT, and hybrid networks, for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of microorganism classification, Cervidae classification, and insect pest classification. It also mentions the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures and how they can be combined to improve performance. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
