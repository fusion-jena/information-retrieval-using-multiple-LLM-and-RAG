Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model was trained using the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 10^-4, but it does not specify the architecture of the model. It also mentions the use of a deep autoencoder (DAE) and a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) in the list of abbreviations, but it does not indicate that these models are used in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
