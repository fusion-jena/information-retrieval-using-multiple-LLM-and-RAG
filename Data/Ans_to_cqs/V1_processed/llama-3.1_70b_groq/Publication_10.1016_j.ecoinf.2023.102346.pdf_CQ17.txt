Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms and their applications in ecology and microbiology, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning or regularization techniques.

However, it does mention "regularized training gain" in the context of the MAXENT model, but it does not provide further details on the specific regularization methods used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.

If you're looking for information on regularization methods in deep learning, I'd be happy to provide general information on the topic, but it would not be based on the provided context.
