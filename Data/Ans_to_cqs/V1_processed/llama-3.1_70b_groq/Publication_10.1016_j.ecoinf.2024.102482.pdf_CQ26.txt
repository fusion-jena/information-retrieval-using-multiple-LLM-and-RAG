Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the application of deep learning technology to predict water quality parameters and biomonitoring data for water quality pollution detection. It also describes the system structure of a model, including the use of LSTM hidden layers, dropout layer, and dense layer. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
