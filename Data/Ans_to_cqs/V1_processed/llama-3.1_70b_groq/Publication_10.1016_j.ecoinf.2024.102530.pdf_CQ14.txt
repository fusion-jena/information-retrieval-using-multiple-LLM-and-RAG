I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the InVEST pollination model, the pollinator species table, and the biophysical attribute table, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. It mentions the use of a 10m resolution pixel in an agricultural context to make more accurate decisions, but it does not explain how the hyperparameters are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
