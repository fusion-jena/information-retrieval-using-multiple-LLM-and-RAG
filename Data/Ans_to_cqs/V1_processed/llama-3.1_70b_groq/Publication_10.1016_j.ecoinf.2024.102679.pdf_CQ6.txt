Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning for wildlife conservation, specifically for detecting animals in aerial imagery, and mentions the use of a pre-trained model that underwent fine-tuning. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that were applied to the data before training the model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model mentioned in the context.
