Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on the relationship between negative air ions and environmental factors, and it discusses the use of random forest models and multiple linear regression. However, it does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
