Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the importance of monitoring the training and validation results over epochs, and how the accuracy and loss curves provide valuable insights into the performance and training progress of the model. However, it does not specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau or a certain level of accuracy. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
