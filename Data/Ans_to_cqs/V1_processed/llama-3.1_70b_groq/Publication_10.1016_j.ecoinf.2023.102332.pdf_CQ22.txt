Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of word embeddings, such as Word2vec and LSA, for semantic analysis and the extraction of perceptions from text data. It mentions that the LSA model has been demonstrated to generate high-quality performance with dense word vectors and produce the best results regarding semantic similarity tasks, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I don't know the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
