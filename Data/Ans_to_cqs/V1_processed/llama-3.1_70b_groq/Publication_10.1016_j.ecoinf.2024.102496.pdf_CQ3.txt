I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to environmental and geographical topics, including watersheds, green infrastructure, and environmental justice. It does not seem to be relevant to deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
