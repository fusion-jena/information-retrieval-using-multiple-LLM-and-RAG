Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that consistent hyperparameters were maintained across all training instances for each task, and the specific values used for batch sizes, learning rates, and number of epochs are provided. However, it does not mention the method used to determine these hyperparameter values, such as grid search, random search, or others.
