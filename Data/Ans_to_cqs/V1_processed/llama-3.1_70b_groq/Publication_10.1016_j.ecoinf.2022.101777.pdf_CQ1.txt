Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, specifically focusing on image classification and simulation data. It includes tables and figures with data on direct flow, simulation time, and event observations, as well as information on satellite imagery (S2A_MSI_L1C and S2B_MSI_2A).

However, it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. If more context or information is provided, I may be able to offer a more accurate response.
