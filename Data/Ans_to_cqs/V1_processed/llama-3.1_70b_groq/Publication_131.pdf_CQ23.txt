To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the researchers employed a few strategies. Firstly, they used a large dataset consisting of 9515 samples, which is a diverse dataset. However, the context does not provide information on the diversity of the dataset in terms of the distribution of different classes or the variability within each class.

Secondly, the researchers used a stratified splitting approach to split the dataset into training and testing sets. They used 80% of the samples (7623) for training and 20% (1892) for testing. This is a common approach to ensure that the model is trained on a large portion of the data and evaluated on a smaller portion.

Thirdly, the researchers used a balanced sampling approach for the test set. They selected one audio sample out of five for each type of anuran call, which ensures that the test set is representative of all classes.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation in the provided context. Cross-validation is a technique where the model is trained and evaluated on multiple folds of the data to ensure that the results are not biased towards a particular split of the data.
