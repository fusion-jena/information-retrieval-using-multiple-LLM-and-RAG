The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the models are being used for prediction tasks, specifically for predicting water quality parameters (WQPs) such as nitrate and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. The context mentions the use of regression metrics such as R2 and RMSE, which suggests that the models are being used for continuous value prediction rather than classification or segmentation tasks. Additionally, the context does not mention any image or signal processing tasks, which are common applications of deep learning models for segmentation or detection tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely regression-based prediction of water quality parameters.
