I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing a hybrid MCMC algorithm and a genetic algorithm used for parameter estimation in a model, but it does not mention deep learning or any specific techniques for ensuring generalizability.
