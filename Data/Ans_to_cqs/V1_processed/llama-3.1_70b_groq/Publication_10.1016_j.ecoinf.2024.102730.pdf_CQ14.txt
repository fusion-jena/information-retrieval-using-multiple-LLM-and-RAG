The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search. Specifically, the Optuna grid search is used to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters for the three different regression tasks. The explored ranges of hyperparameters are listed in Table 2, and the optimal values for each task are displayed in the right-most three columns. The grid search focuses on minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to identify the optimal hyperparameters.
