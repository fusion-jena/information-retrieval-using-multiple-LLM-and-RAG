Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. However, Table 13 is mentioned as presenting the results of a sensitivity study conducted on the BEiT (12 M) model, which investigates its performance under various experimental setups, including modifications to crucial parameters like learning rate, batch size, regularization intensity, and training epochs.

Although the context does not provide specific values for these hyperparameters, it suggests that the model's performance was evaluated under different settings, and the optimal settings were likely identified through this sensitivity study. Unfortunately, the actual values of these hyperparameters are not provided in the given context.
