I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a snippet from a research paper, including references, author information, and a declaration of competing interests. The "Data availability" section mentions that the datasets generated and/or analyzed during the study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request, but it does not specify a public data repository.
