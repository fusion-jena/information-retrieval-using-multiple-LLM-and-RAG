Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the use of network structure for supervised learning, the effects of water motion on coral photosynthesis and calcification, and the impact of marine pollution on coral reefs. It does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

However, it does mention the use of additional variables to increase the dimensions used in the assessment, which could potentially help to reduce data bias. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a deep learning model combined with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of spotted butterfish, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
