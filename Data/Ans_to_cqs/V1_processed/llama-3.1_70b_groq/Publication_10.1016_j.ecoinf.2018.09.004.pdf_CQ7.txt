The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does describe a method called cross-validation, which is used to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms.

According to the context, cross-validation splits the dataset into K equally-sized parts, called folds. In each iteration, (K-1) folds are used for training, and the remaining fold is used for testing. This process is repeated, and the overall measure of performance is the average of the measures of the individual iterations.

The context also mentions a variant of cross-validation called stratified cross-validation, which is used to ensure that each fold has a balanced number of instances for each class.

However, it does not provide information on how to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets for deep learning model training. The context only mentions the use of stratified cross-validation with K=10 folds for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
