Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the configuration of Random Forest (RF) training parameters and the performance of different machine learning models, including RF, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), on a specific dataset.

However, it does mention that the performance of the models was evaluated on both training and testing datasets, as shown in Table 2. But it does not provide information on how the data was split into training and testing sets, or if a validation set was used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context.
