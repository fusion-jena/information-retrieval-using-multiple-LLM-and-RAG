The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Number of epochs: 500
* Initial learning rate: 0.01
* Weight decay: 0.005
* Optimizer: Adam
* Beta1 (for Adam optimizer): 0.937

These hyperparameters were used for training the models, along with data augmentation transformations to artificially increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.
