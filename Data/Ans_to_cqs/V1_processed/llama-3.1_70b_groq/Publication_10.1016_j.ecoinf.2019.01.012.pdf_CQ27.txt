Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, architecture, and performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It discusses the use of manually labeled samples, the training process, and the evaluation of the model's performance. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
