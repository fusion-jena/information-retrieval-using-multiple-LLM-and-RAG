Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to focus on the development of a crawling tool for collecting historical and near real-time data from different SRS products, the parameters included in the data, and the characteristics of the Sentinel-3-related products. It also mentions some research papers and figures related to remote sensing and ecological informatics, but does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
