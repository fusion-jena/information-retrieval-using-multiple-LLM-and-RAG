The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is a broader and more conservative testing strategy, which involves excluding three transects (~17% of the data) for testing in each iteration, specifically one from each target class - "Plateau" (p), "White-sand" (w), and "Riparian" (r). Additionally, a cumulative evaluation was performed to measure the model's performance across all transects by assessing the coefficient of determination (R2) between true vs predicted for all 648 multitemporal transects predictions.
