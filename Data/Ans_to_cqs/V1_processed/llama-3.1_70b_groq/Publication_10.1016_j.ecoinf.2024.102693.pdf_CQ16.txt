Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the hyper-parameters used for training different models (Table 1) and the performance of these models on the IP102 dataset (Tables 2 and 3). It does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
