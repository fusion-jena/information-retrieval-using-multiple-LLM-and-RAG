Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization, model performance, and the importance of considering multiple hyperparameters when designing an optimized model. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
