Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only mentions that the algorithm goes through cycles of training on the training set, evaluating performance on the validation set, adjusting CNN node weights, and repeating the entire cycle, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
