Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the MTMI-SMF algorithm. The text only mentions that the algorithm requires a few parameters to be set by the user, such as the number of initialized targets, initialization method, and alpha value, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
