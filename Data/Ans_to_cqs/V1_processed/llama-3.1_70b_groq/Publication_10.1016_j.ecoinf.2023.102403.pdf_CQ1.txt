The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of public datasets, specifically the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) repositories, as sources of data for analysis. 

It also mentions the application of filters to the dataset to enhance the quality and reliability of the information, including filtering by columns labeled "scientific name", "family", "year", "longitude", and "latitude", and removing records with NA in these columns and duplicate records with identical latitude.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of R packages, such as KnowBR, and data integration techniques to enable global biodiversity synthesis. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, such as surveys or sensors.
