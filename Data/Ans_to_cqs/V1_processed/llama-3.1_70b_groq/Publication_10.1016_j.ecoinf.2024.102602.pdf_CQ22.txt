The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy (ACC), specificity (or True Negative Rate: TNR), sensitivity (or recall or True Positive Rate: TPR), and F1-score (F1). These metrics are commonly adopted for classification tasks. 

Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances. Specificity measures the proportion of true negatives (i.e., instances that do not have Cortaderia selloana) that are correctly classified. Sensitivity measures the proportion of true positives (i.e., instances that have Cortaderia selloana) that are correctly classified. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.

Additionally, for object detection models, the mean average precision (mAP) at 0.50 IOU is used as a performance metric. The average inference time per image and total loss (sum of classification and localization losses) are also considered for model evaluation.
