Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the process of generating redescriptions using the SIREN interface and setting parameters for the analysis, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
