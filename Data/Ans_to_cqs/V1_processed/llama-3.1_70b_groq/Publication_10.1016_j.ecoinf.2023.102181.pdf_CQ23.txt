The provided context does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of covariance-weighted bagging and benchmarking against other methods to assess the capacity for unbiased validation.

Regarding measures to ensure generalizability, the context mentions the use of out-of-bag validation, which is a technique used to evaluate the accuracy of a model by predicting the values at data points that were not selected for each bootstrap sample and averaging the results across all samples.

Additionally, the context mentions that spatial partitioning and spatial cross-validation approaches are typically used to deal with biased model validation caused by clustered sampling. However, it notes that these approaches can be overly aggressive at penalizing the predictive capacity of the model and may not be suitable for all cases.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability.
