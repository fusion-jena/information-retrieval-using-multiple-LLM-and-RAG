I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and a study on drought propagation using a CNN-LSTM model, but it does not provide information on where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
