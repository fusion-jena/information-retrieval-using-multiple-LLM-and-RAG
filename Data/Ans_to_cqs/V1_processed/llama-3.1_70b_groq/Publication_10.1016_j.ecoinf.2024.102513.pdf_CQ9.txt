I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of a deep neural network for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, the architecture of the convolutional neural network, and the benefits of the approach, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.
