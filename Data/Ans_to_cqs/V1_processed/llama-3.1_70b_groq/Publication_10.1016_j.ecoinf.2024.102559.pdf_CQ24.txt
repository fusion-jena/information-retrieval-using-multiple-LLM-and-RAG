The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. However, it does mention the use of a random forest (RF) binary classification model, which is a type of ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions.

In the context of the random forest model, the text mentions that "each tree in the RF is created using a subset of the training data randomly sampled with replacement." This suggests that randomness is introduced in the model through the random sampling of the training data for each tree. However, it does not provide information on how this randomness is controlled or handled, such as through the use of a random seed value.

Therefore, I do not know what specific strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values, based on the provided context.
