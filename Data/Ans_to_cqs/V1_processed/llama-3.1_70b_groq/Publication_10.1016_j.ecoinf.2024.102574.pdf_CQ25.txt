The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. According to the provided context, the deep learning model is used for classification of LiDAR and UAV point clouds for Digital Terrain Model (DTM) creation and flood risk mapping. Additionally, the model is also used for tree species classification, individual tree segmentation, and ground cover classification. The context mentions the use of various machine learning techniques such as random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion techniques, and neural networks for establishing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) equations through the integration of UAV-LiDAR, hyperspectral, and high-resolution RGB data.
