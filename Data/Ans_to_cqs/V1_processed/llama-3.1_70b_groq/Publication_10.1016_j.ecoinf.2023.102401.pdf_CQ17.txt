Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on feature extraction, feature fusion, and network architectures, but does not discuss regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
