Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of algorithms, training parameters, and techniques such as matrix factorization and deep learning, but it does not provide information about the datasets used. It mentions that the data is generated by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), but it does not specify the particular datasets used for training and testing the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
