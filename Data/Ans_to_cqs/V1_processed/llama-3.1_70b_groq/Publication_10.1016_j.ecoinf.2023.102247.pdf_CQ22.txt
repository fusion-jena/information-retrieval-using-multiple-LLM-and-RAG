The text does not mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of an ensemble modeling approach that includes machine-learning models such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). To evaluate the performance of these models, the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) is used as the index of accuracy. AUC is a scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with higher values indicating more accurate models.
