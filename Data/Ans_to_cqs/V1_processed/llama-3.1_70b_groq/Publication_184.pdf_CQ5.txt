The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the model is trained on images of fish, and Figure 8 shows some training samples with fish images. The context also mentions that the model is used for fish tracking and counting, and it references a paper titled "Fish tracking and counting using deep learning" by Lumauag and Nava.

It can be inferred that the dataset used in this pipeline is a custom dataset of fish images, but the exact name or details of the dataset are not provided.
