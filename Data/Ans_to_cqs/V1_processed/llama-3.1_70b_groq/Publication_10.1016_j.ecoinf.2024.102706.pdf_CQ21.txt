Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine) on a dataset, including metrics such as R2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MAE. It also discusses the variable importance and provides some statistical analysis.

However, it does mention the calculation of various metrics (R2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MAE) and provides a table with the results. But it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training, but I do not have information on other potential steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices.
