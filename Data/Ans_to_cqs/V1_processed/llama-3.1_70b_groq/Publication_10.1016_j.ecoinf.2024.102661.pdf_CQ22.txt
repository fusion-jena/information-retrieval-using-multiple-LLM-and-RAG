The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values.
2. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This metric measures the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, such as ARIMA, BPNN, LSTM, and TPEBO-LSTM. The results show that the TPEBO-LSTM model outperforms the other models, with a 70.56% decrease in MAE and a 64.50% reduction in RMSE.

Additionally, the DM test statistics and P-values are used to compare the forecasting models, with the results indicating that the TPEBO-LSTM model's superior performance is statistically significant.

Note that accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model.
