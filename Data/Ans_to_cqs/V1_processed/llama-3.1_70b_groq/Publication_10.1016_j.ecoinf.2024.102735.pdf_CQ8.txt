I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various research papers and studies that have used machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
