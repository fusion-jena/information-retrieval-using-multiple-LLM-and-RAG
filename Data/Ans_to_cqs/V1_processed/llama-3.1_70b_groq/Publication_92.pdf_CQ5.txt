The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the network architecture follows GoogLeNet's, which was a winner of the ImageNet competition in 2014. 

It also mentions that the network was trained on a custom dataset of cropped thumbnails and their labels, which includes classes such as "part of fish", "fish", and "random/speciÔ¨Åc background". The context also mentions that the dataset contains 55,848 samples of "part of fish", 970 samples of "fish", and a large number of background samples (116,820 and 91,247). 

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of well-known datasets like MNIST or CIFAR, it does suggest that the network was trained on a custom dataset related to fish detection and recognition in underwater videos.
