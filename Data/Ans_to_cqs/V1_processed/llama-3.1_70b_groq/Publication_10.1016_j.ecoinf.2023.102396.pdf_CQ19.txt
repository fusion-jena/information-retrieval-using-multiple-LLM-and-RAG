Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context appears to be a research article about classifying animal population time series using various methods such as dynamic time warping, hierarchical clustering, and state space models. However, it does not mention the use of deep learning models or specific frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
