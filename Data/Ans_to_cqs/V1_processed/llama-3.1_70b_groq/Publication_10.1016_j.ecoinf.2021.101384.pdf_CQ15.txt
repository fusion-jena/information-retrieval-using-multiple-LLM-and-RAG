I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to big data processing, workflow, and ecological informatics, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer to this query.
