Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The only table related to hyperparameters is Table 2, which presents the hyperparameters used for data augmentation, specifying the ranges and probabilities for each augmentation technique. However, this table is not included in the provided context, so I couldn't access the information.

Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.
