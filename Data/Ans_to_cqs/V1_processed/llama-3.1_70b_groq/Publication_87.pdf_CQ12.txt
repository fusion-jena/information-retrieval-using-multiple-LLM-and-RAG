The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the code snippet provided uses a ResNet architecture, with either ResNet18 or ResNet50 being used depending on the specific example. This is evident from the line of code `arch = resnet18()` or the mention of using a ResNet50 to get the full results presented in the main text.
