I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The text appears to be discussing a study on the spatial arrangement of marine organism aggregations using multifrequency acoustics data and spatial-functional data analysis. The context mentions the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Functional Generalized Additive Models (FGSAMs), but does not mention deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
