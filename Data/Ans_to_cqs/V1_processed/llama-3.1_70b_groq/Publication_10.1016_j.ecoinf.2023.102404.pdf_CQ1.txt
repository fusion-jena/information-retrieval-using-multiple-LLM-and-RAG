The provided context mentions several methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, particularly in the field of remote sensing and environmental monitoring. These methods include:

1. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data: This method is mentioned in the context as a source of data for estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) in forests. LiDAR technology uses laser pulses to create high-resolution 3D models of the environment.
2. Satellite imagery: The context mentions the use of satellite data from platforms such as Landsat, Sentinel-1, and ICESat-2. These satellites provide multispectral and hyperspectral data that can be used for various environmental monitoring applications.
3. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery: The context mentions the use of UAS imagery for estimating shrub willow biomass. UAS, also known as drones, can provide high-resolution aerial imagery for various environmental monitoring applications.
4. Public datasets: The context mentions the use of public datasets, such as those provided by Google Earth Engine, which offers a vast repository of satellite and other Earth observation data.
5. Radar data: The context mentions the use of dual-polarimetric radar data from Sentinel-1 for crop growth monitoring.

These methods are used to collect raw data, which is then processed and used to train deep learning models for various environmental monitoring applications, such as biomass estimation, crop growth monitoring, and forest height mapping.
