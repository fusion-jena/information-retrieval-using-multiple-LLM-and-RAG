The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does suggest some potential strategies that could be employed to improve the model's performance and generalizability.

For instance, the text mentions that "increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea conditions in the training datasets" could improve the model's performance. This suggests that using a diverse dataset could be a strategy to ensure generalizability. Additionally, the text mentions the possibility of "building hierarchical training datasets with different behaviour across different species", which could be a form of stratified splitting.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or other techniques to ensure generalizability. It is also worth noting that the text mentions that "further research could increase the performance and variety of species identified by our CNN-model", which suggests that the model's generalizability may be limited and could be improved with additional research.

Overall, while the text provides some hints about strategies to improve the model's generalizability, it does not provide a clear answer to the question.
