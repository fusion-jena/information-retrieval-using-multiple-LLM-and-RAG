The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is a publicly available dataset in Roboflow named Animal2-v1. This dataset comprises 9952 images belonging to seven classes: Bear, Deer, Elephant, Leopard, Monkey, Tiger, and Wild-boar. The images are annotated in YOLOv5 PyTorch format and are preprocessed by auto-orientation of pixel data with EXIF-format stripping, and resizing to 416 Ã— 416 (stretch). The dataset is split into 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing.
