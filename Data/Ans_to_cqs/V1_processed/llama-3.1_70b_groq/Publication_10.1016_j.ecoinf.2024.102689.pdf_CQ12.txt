The provided context mentions several deep learning models used in various research papers, but it does not specifically mention a single pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in the field of fish species recognition and underwater individual fish recognition.

For example, Rauf et al. (2019) proposed a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species recognition, which comprises 32 deep layers. Additionally, Zhang et al. (2021) used an improved YoloV4, which is a type of CNN, for underwater fish individual recognition.

Other types of deep learning models, such as RNNs and Transformers, are not explicitly mentioned in the context as being used in the pipeline for fish species recognition or underwater individual fish recognition. However, it is possible that these models may be used in other related research or applications.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that CNNs are the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
