Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on the information given, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps.

The context mentions the use of metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE to evaluate the performance of the model. This suggests that one of the postprocessing steps might involve calculating these metrics to assess the quality of the generated images.

Additionally, the context provides a quantitative comparison of the model's performance with other methods in Table 4, which implies that some form of evaluation or comparison is being done after the model training.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the importance of different input features, while confusion matrices are used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Since the context does not mention classification or saliency maps, it is unlikely that these are part of the postprocessing steps.

In summary, based on the provided context, one possible postprocessing step is the calculation of metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE to evaluate the model's performance. However, we cannot confirm the involvement of saliency maps or confusion matrices without further information.
