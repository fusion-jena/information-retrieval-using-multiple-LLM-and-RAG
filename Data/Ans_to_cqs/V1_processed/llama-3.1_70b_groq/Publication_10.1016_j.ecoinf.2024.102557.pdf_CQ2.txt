Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. This is evident from the paper "Machine learning for image based species identification" by WÃ¤chter et al. (2018), which suggests that machine learning algorithms can be used for image-based species identification.

Additionally, the paper "Applications for deep learning in ecology" by Christin et al. (2019) mentions the use of deep learning for image classification tasks in ecology. However, it does not provide specific information on the data formats used.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is mentioned in the context of species distribution models, but it is not clear if it is used as an input data format for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the available information, it appears that image data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline, but the specific formats (e.g., JPEG, TIFF, etc.) are not mentioned.
