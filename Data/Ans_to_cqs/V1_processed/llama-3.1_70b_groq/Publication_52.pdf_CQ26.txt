Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and their applications in biosecurity, particularly in machine hearing for marine species identification. It highlights the advantages of ELMs, such as their ability to learn from huge training data sets and their fast learning speed compared to conventional neural networks.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. The context mentions the use of ELMs in various applications, including object recognition, sound event classification, and species classification, but it does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or would like to know more about ELMs or their applications, I would be happy to help.
