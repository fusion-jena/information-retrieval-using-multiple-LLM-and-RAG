Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the refinement of hyperparameters for machine learning models, model evaluation, and hyperparameter selection using cross-validation resampling. It also provides information on the input data, including precipitation, temperature, and land use factors, but does not elaborate on how this data was collected.

However, it can be inferred that the data might be collected from various sources such as weather stations, satellite imagery, or geographic information systems (GIS), as the context mentions the use of land use factors and precipitation data. Additionally, the context cites several research papers and articles, which might provide more information on the data collection methods used in those specific studies.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
