The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of batch normalization (BNorm) layers to prevent overfitting in the BatNet model. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of addressing issues related to data bias and overfitting, but the specific techniques used for preprocessing are not mentioned.

The context does mention that the model is trained on a large batch size of 128 images, which may help to reduce the impact of data bias. Additionally, the use of shortcuts among layers in the BatNet model may help to preserve information and reduce the impact of data bias.

However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
