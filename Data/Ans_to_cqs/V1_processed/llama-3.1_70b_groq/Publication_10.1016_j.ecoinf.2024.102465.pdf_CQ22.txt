Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, data processing, and models used for sentiment analysis and semantic segmentation. 

However, it does mention that the LSTM-CNN model outperformed other models in sentiment task analysis, citing a study by Sosa (2017). This suggests that some form of evaluation was conducted to compare the performance of different models, but the specific metrics used are not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions that the HRNet model is used for semantic segmentation due to its high accuracy and stability, but it does not provide further details on how accuracy is measured or what other metrics are used to evaluate its performance.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
