Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for tasks such as semi-supervised clustering and representation learning, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, it is possible to make an educated inference based on the references provided. For example, the reference to "Acoustic auto-encoders for biodiversity assessment" (Rowe et al., 2021) suggests that audio sensors or recordings may be used as a data source. Similarly, the reference to "Polarization lidar measurements of honey bees in flight" (Shaw et al., 2005) implies that lidar sensors may be used for data collection.

Despite these hints, the context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not contain sufficient information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
