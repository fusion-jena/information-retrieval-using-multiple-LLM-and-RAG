The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is object detection. Specifically, the models are designed to detect objects in images, classify them into different categories, and refine their bounding boxes. The models mentioned, such as Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet, and R-CNN, are all object detection algorithms that aim to accurately locate and classify objects within images.

In addition to object detection, some of the models mentioned are also used for tasks such as estimating seagrass coverage and mapping seagrass distribution. For example, Wang et al. (2020a) developed an encoder-decoder based deep-learning model to estimate seagrass coverage, and Perez et al. (2020) used a deep capsule network and a deep CNN to map seagrass distribution.

However, the primary focus of the context appears to be on object detection, with various models being compared and evaluated based on their performance on this task.
