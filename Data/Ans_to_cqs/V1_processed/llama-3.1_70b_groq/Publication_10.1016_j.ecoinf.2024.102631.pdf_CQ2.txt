The deep learning pipeline uses images as the primary data format. Specifically, the network takes images with dimensions of 256 Ã— 256 pixels and three color channels as input. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. The focus is solely on image processing and enhancement, with the network designed to learn features from images and produce enhanced image outputs.
