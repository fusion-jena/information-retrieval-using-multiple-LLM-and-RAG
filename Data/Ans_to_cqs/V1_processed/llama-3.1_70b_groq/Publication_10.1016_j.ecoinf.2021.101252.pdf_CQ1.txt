Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in ecology, the importance of considering the temporal component of phenomena, and the use of AutoML procedures for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

However, it can be inferred that the data collection methods might vary depending on the specific ecological phenomenon being studied. For instance, the context mentions the use of continuous climate data, which could be collected through sensors or public datasets. Additionally, the reference to "optoacoustic signal processing" in the context of insect biometrics suggests that sensors might be used to collect data in certain applications.

The context also mentions the use of time series data, which could be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, and it is likely that the methods vary depending on the specific application and ecological phenomenon being studied.
