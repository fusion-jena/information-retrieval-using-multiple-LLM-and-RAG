Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on water quality management, environmental pollution, and machine learning applications in these fields. While it does mention the use of Random Forest (RF) modeling and its robustness to data noise, it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or regularization methods.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of Random Forest modeling, which is an ensemble learning method that can be less prone to overfitting due to its inherent properties, such as bagging and feature selection. Nevertheless, this is not a direct answer to the query, and I couldn't find any information on dropout, L2 regularization, or other regularization methods in the provided context.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
