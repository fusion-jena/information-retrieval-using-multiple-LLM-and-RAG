Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training and retraining of the model, including the architecture used (ResNet50), the optimizer (adam), and the framework (keras and TensorFlow). It also mentions the process of selecting new training images for model retraining and the importance of manual classification. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
