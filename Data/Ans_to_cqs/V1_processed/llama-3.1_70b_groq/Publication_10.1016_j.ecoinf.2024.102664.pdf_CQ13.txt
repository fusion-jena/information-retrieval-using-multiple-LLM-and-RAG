The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate. However, it does mention the optimizers used for training the networks. According to Table 1, the optimizers used are:

* Adam
* Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM)
* RMSProp

These optimizers are used in combination with different input time series lengths (3 days, 5 days, and 7 days) to train the CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models. The context does not provide information on the learning rate or other hyperparameters used in the models.
