Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on the topic of predicting potential natural vegetation (PNV) using machine learning methods, including neural networks, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as random weight initialization, dropout, and data augmentation. To handle randomness, researchers and practitioners often employ techniques such as:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like batch normalization to reduce the effect of randomness in the data.
3. Employing regularization techniques, such as dropout, to prevent overfitting.
4. Averaging the results of multiple models trained with different random seeds to reduce the effect of randomness.

However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. If you're looking for specific information on handling randomness in the context of PNV prediction, I'm afraid I don't know the answer.
