Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of a pre-trained EfficientNet B0 network, fine-tuning the model with a new dataset, and the use of a novel spectrogram representation as input to the network. However, it does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the data.

It is mentioned that the audio data is input to the network in a spectrogram representation, which suggests that some form of preprocessing may have been involved in converting the raw audio data into spectrograms. However, the specific details of this process are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
