The pipeline uses a combination of deep learning models, including HRNet, LSTM-CNN, and ERNIE. 

HRNet is used for semantic segmentation of social media images, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that simultaneously merges high-resolution and low-resolution convolution computations.

The LSTM-CNN model is used for sentiment analysis of text data, which combines the strengths of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN). This model leverages the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local feature extraction capability of CNN.

ERNIE is a pre-trained model used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but its specific architecture is not mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that it is used in the LSTM-CNN framework for sentiment analysis.

Therefore, the pipeline uses a combination of CNN, RNN (LSTM), and potentially Transformer (ERNIE) architectures.
