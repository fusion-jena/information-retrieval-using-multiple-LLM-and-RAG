Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and the Apriori algorithm, but it does not discuss deep learning or data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
