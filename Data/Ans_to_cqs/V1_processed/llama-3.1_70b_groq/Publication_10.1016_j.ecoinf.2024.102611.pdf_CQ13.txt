The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. However, it does mention that in the work by Barhate et al. (2023), the stochastic gradient descent technique was used with batch updates and hyperparameter tuning for the VGG-16 model. No further details are provided about the specific hyperparameters used.
