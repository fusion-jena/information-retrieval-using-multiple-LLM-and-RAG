The provided context does not specifically mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that scale and otolith images are used for age and growth estimations, and that these images are stored in a collaborative online space. This suggests that image data is used in the process, but it does not provide information on the specific format of these images (e.g., JPEG, TIFF, etc.).

Additionally, the context mentions that metadata is generated and stored, but it does not specify the format of this metadata (e.g., CSV, JSON, etc.). It also mentions that the data follows the FAIR data principles, which include using formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable languages for knowledge representation, but it does not provide specific information on the data formats used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be confirmed that image data is used, but the specific format of this data is not mentioned. The use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV is not mentioned at all.
