Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The text appears to discuss the use of machine learning models, specifically covariance-weighted bagging, for predicting response variables from environmental data. It also mentions the use of techniques such as kriging and sequential simulation for generating predictions and accuracy metrics. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained model, including model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
