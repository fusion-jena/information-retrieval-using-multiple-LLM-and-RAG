To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the employed strategy is to use a random number seed, referred to as 'seed', to ensure reproducibility. The 'seed' is used to randomly select half of the pixels for the training and testing split. This approach ensures that the training/testing dataset accurately represents the distribution of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps.

Furthermore, the 'seed' is also used to ensure reproducibility in the grid search process, where multiple seeds are evaluated to select the one that provides the most stable and reliable results. This approach helps to minimize the impact of randomness on the model's performance and ensures that the results are consistent across different runs.

Additionally, the use of stratified random sampling technique is employed to capture the full distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps accurately. This approach ensures that the training/testing dataset is representative of the population, which helps to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.

Overall, the employed strategies aim to minimize the impact of randomness on the model's performance and ensure reproducibility, which is crucial in deep learning pipelines.
