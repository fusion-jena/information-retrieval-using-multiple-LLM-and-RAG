Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the features and advantages of the XGBoost model, its application in landslide risk assessment, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
