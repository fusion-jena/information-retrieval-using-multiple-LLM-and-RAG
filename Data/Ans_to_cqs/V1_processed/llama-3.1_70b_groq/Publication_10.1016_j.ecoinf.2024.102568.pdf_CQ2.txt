The text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the data is in a numerical format, as it is being pre-processed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature by scaling it to a [0â€“1] range. This suggests that the data is likely in a tabular format, such as CSV, and consists of numerical values. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
