I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to be discussing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and its application to classify blue whale vocalizations and noise signals. The context mentions parameters used for the WT-HMM simulation, such as the number of states, mixture weights, and the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, but it does not mention deep learning or its associated hyperparameters.
