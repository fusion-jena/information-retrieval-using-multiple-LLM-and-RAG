Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. In fact, the text mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. Therefore, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that would be involved in training a deep learning model.

However, it does mention that hyperparameter optimization was performed using random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods for the machine learning models (RF, GBDT, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost) that were trained. But it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that were involved before training these models.

If you're looking for general information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, common steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. But this information is not specific to the context provided.
