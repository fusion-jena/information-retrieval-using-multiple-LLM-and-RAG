Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, including the use of transfer learning, the selection of a minibatch size, and the training iterations, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
