The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model was trained for ten epochs, and the error rate and validation loss were monitored during this process. 

In the initial training process, the model achieved an error rate of 0.1538 (15.38%) and a validation loss of 0.4211 at epoch 5. The model was then fine-tuned by unfreezing the entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10âˆ’4). The final model achieved an accuracy of 94.8% (error rate of 5.2%) with a training loss of 0.1397 and a validation loss of 0.1446 after ten epochs.

It can be inferred that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs (ten epochs), but the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified in the provided context.
