Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis, specifically discussing the processing of Chinese text data and the use of the ERNIE model for emotional analysis. There is no mention of datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are typically used for image classification tasks.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
