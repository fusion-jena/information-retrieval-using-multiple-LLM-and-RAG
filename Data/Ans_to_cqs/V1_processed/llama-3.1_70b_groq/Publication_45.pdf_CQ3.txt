Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the basics of deep learning, the architecture of deep neural networks, and their application in ecological prediction. It also discusses the training process and the importance of network architecture in determining prediction accuracy. However, it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
