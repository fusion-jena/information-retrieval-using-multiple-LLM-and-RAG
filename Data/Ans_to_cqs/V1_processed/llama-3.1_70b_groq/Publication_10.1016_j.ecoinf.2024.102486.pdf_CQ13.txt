Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be a list of references and citations related to various topics in machine learning and deep learning, including particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo, CUDA programming, and data augmentation. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
