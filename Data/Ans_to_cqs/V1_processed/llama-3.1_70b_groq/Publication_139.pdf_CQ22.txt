The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). 

The average unweighted and category-weighted training classification accuracies are reported as 98.9% and 97.4%, respectively. For the test data, the average unweighted and weighted accuracies are 94.7% and 88.8%. 

The F1-scores for the training and testing datasets are reported as 0.980 and 0.907, respectively. 

Additionally, the area under the curve (AUC) is also used as a metric for training, computed by a Riemann sum. 

Recall scores are also mentioned in the context of the validation database performance, but the specific recall scores are not provided in the given text snippet.
