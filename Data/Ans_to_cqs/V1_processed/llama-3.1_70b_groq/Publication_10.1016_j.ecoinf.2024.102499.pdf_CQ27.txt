Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the training process, model architecture, and evaluation metrics used. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related details. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
