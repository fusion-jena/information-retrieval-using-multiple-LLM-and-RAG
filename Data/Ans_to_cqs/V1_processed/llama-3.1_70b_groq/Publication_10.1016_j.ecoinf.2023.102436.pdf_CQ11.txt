I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It mentions that data will be made available on request, but it does not provide a specific link to a repository. Additionally, it mentions a link to supplementary data (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102436), but it is not clear if this link is related to a deep learning pipeline.
