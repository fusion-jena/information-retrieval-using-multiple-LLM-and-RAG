Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning (ML) models for image classification and object detection tasks, particularly in the context of wildlife monitoring using camera traps. It discusses the use of ML bounding box models to accelerate the data labeling process, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
