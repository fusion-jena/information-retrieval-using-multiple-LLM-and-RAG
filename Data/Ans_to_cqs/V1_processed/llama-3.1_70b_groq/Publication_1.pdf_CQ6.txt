Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the basics of deep learning, its applications, and its potential use in biodiversity monitoring, but it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial before training a deep learning model. These steps help to prepare the data for training by reducing the impact of dominant features, handling missing values, and removing noise.

Since the provided context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps, I cannot provide a detailed answer. If you are looking for information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I recommend consulting a more comprehensive resource on the topic.
