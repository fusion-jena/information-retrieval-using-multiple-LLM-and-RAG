The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset is imbalanced and that data overfitting is a problem that needs to be overcome. 

It is mentioned that the dataset is split into training and validation sets, and that the training dataset is augmented 10 times to improve the ability of the model to generalize. This suggests that some form of data augmentation or oversampling may be used to address data imbalance. However, the specific techniques used to address data bias are not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context mentions that the misclassified data is swapped between the training and validation datasets to enhance fine-grained feature extraction accuracy. This suggests that some form of data manipulation or resampling is used to improve the model's performance, but the exact techniques used to address data bias are not clear.
