I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily discusses the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and transfer learning techniques in the study, as well as the organization of the article and the implications of the findings. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
