The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mention of "semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping" and the evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy, it can be inferred that the model is likely a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a variant of it. CNNs are commonly used for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, which aligns with the described application. However, without explicit mention, it's impossible to confirm the exact type of model used.
