Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on various topics, including plant physiology, fog computing, smartphone-based optical assays, and contact imaging using a Raspberry Pi camera. None of the provided references or text snippets mention data annotation techniques for deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
