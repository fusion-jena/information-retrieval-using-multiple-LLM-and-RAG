Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the models were implemented using the PyTorch Lightning framework, which is built on top of PyTorch, but it does not provide information on where the code is hosted.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
