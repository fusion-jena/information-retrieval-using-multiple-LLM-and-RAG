I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning tasks, specifically in the context of regression with structurally incomplete target labels. It discusses various types of label noise and incompleteness, as well as methods for imputing missing labels, but does not mention regularization techniques.
