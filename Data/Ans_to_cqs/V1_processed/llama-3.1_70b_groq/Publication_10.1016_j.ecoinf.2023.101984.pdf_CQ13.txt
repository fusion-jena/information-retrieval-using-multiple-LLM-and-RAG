I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a MaxEnt model, which is a type of machine learning model used for species distribution modeling. The context mentions the use of maximum iterations with the subsample run type and a 30 random test percentage, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
