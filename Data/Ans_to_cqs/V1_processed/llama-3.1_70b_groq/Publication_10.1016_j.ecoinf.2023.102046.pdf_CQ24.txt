Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models (ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and ViT) for otolith age determination, their architectures, and training parameters. It does not discuss randomness or strategies to handle it.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of class weights in the cross-entropy loss function to deal with dataset imbalance, which could be related to handling randomness in the data. But it does not provide any information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
