Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms, particularly random forests and support vector machines, and their applications in behavioral classification using animal movement data. It does not delve into deep learning or neural networks, which are typically associated with regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
