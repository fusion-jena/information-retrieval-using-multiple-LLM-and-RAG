Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It also discusses the different deep learning models used for plant disease classification, including EfficientNet, DenseNet, and ResNet, among others. However, it does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
