Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context includes tables and figures related to the performance of different deep learning algorithms (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) and their classification accuracies, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
