The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are mean squared error/root mean squared error (MSE/RMSE) and mean absolute error. These metrics are specifically mentioned in the context as the top metrics for regression problems, which is the type of problem the deep learning model is trying to solve. The context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, which are typically used for classification problems.
