The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated in three phases: 

1. Overfitting is checked.
2. The model is evaluated with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets.
3. Field experts evaluate the model with another completely new dataset.

These phases are outlined in Fig. 3, but the specific strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training is not provided.
