I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The references listed include papers and datasets, but there is no mention of a code repository or a link to a specific platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
