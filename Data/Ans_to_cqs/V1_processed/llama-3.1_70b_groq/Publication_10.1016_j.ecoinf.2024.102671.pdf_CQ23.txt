Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing a study on ecological carbon sink risk zones, and it mentions the use of a framework that aligns carbon sink priorities with landscape risks, as well as the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods. However, it does not mention deep learning models or any specific measures taken to ensure their generalizability.

That being said, the context does mention some limitations of the study, including the need for a more refined cross-validation approach that incorporates temporal, spatial, and hierarchical structures inherent in ecological data. This suggests that the study may not have used robust cross-validation techniques to assess the generalizability of its models. However, this is not specific to deep learning models, and it is not clear if deep learning models were even used in the study.
