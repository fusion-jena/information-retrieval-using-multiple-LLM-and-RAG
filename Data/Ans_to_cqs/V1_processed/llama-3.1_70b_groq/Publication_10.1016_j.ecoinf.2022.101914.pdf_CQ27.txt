Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the process of building and training individual models, including subsetting background points, training component models, and evaluating them using AUC and TSS. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
