The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) which is a type of feed-forward neural network. This is mentioned in the context as one of the models used, along with XGB and SVR. 

There is no mention of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context. The context does reference a paper by Reichstein et al. (2019) titled "Deep learning and process understanding for data-driven earth system science", but it does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
