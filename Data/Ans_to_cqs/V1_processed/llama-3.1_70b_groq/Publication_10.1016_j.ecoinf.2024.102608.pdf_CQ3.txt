Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically neural networks, to ecological informatics and remote sensing, rather than computer vision or image processing tasks that typically involve data annotation techniques.

However, it does mention the use of machine learning algorithms to extract patterns from datasets with minimal prior knowledge, capture data-rich features, and establish relationships. It also mentions the use of neural networks (NN) in various scientific domains, but it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
