The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on the tables and figures provided, it appears that the model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics on the training, validation, and test sets. The accuracy values are reported for both raw and pre-processed data, suggesting that the model performance is monitored and compared across different data preprocessing conditions. Additionally, the use of confusion matrices (Fig. 5) implies that the model performance is also evaluated using other metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. However, the specific strategy or methodology used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
