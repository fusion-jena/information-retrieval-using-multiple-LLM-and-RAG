Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models for tasks such as traffic flow prediction, environmental monitoring, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the datasets used for these tasks.

The context mentions specific research papers and studies, but it does not provide details on the datasets used in these studies. For example, the study on reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers mentions monitoring stations on the Rhone and Loire rivers, but it does not provide information on the specific dataset used for this study.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
