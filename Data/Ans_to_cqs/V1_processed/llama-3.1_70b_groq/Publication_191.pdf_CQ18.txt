The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the learning rate is decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving in the case of the deconvolutional network. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set is being monitored, and the learning rate is adjusted accordingly.
