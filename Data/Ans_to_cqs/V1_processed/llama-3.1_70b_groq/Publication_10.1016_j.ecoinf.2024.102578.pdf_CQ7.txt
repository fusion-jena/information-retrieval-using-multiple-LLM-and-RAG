Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text only mentions that separate two-class models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal using the keras package in R, and that preliminary trials showed that region-specific models performed better. It also provides details on the model architecture, hyperparameters, and performance metrics, but does not discuss data splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
