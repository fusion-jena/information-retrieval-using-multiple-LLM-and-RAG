The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated using various metrics such as AUC, Omission, TPR, Kappa, and TSS. These metrics were calculated for different test sets, including a random test set and a test set specific to Irish records. The best model is highlighted in bold for each metric, suggesting that the performance was compared across different models or iterations. Additionally, the use of the 10th percentile training presence as a threshold suggests that the model was evaluated using a specific criterion. However, the exact strategy or methodology used to monitor the model performance during training is not provided.
