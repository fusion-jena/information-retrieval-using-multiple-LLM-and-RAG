Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text only discusses the architectures of the models used (ResNet, RepVGG, and MobileNet-V3), the dataset, and the experimental setup, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
