The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves the use of video and image data formats.

The context mentions that the system extracts frames from videos, which suggests that the input data is in video format. Additionally, the mention of image filtering/enhancement and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implies that the pipeline involves the processing of image data.

There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that the pipeline involves the use of video and image data formats.
