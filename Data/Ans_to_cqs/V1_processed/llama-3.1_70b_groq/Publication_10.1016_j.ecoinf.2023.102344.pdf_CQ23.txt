To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a composite numerical dataset was collected from five location sites in Portugal, which suggests that the dataset is diverse and representative of different locations. 

Additionally, stratified sampling was employed to split the dataset into training and testing sets. Specifically, 80% (240 data rows) of the dataset was used for training the model, and 20% (60 data rows) was used for testing. This stratified splitting approach helps to ensure that the model is trained and tested on a representative sample of the data, which can improve its generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation being used in the provided context. Cross-validation is a technique where the model is trained and tested on multiple folds of the data to evaluate its performance and generalizability. The absence of cross-validation might be a limitation of the study.

Overall, the use of a diverse dataset and stratified splitting suggests that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, the lack of cross-validation might be a limitation that needs to be addressed in future studies.
