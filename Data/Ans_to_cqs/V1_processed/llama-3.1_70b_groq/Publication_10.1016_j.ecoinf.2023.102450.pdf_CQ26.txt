Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article that discusses various deep learning techniques for object tracking and detection, but it does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing or bias mitigation.

However, I can provide some general information on common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar class distribution.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources or environments to reduce bias and increase generalizability.

It's worth noting that the context does mention the use of various deep learning techniques, such as Siamese networks and YOLOv4, but it does not provide information on how data bias was addressed during preprocessing. If you're looking for specific information on how data bias was addressed in this particular study, I would recommend consulting the original research paper or contacting the authors directly.
