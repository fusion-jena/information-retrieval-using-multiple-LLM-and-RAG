Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on methods for evaluating the interpretability of deep learning models, including model decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and feature visualization. It also mentions specific techniques like gradient-based sensitivity analysis (GBSA), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and class activation maps.

However, it does reference a comprehensive review of deep learning in remote sensing by Zhu et al. (2017) and a book on deep learning by Goodfellow et al. (2016), which may cover optimization techniques used in deep learning. But based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
