I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecology, and conservation biology, and discusses topics such as ensemble modeling, cross-validation, and model performance evaluation. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
