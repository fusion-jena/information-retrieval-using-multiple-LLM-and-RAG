The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "data augmentation" as a technique used in conjunction with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for environmental sound classification. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.

It is also mentioned that the CNN model was compared with and without augmentation, suggesting that data augmentation was used to improve the performance of the model. However, the specific techniques used for data augmentation are not mentioned.

The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if these techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
