The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two metrics: overall accuracy and F1 score. 

The overall accuracy is computed as the percentage of correctly classified pixels. 

The F1 score is computed for each class as the harmonic average of precision and recall. Precision is the ratio of the number of segments classified correctly as a particular class to the number of all segments (true and false positive), and recall is the ratio of the number of segments classified correctly as a particular class to the total number of segments belonging to that class (true positive and false negative). The F1 score varies between 0 (lowest value) and 1 (best value).
