Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9 is used to train the model, and that other hyper-parameter settings for model training are shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information, which is not provided. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters are optimized (e.g., grid search, random search).
