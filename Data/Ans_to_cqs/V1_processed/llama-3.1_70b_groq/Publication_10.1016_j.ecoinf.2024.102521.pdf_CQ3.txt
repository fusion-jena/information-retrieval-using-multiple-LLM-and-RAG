The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that users can manually label some of their images and trigger retraining, and that the program STARdbi_split_images is available for the generation of classification models. Additionally, it mentions that users can download images and their box annotations (as Comma Separated Values, csv, files), which suggests that bounding box annotation is used in some form. However, the exact details of the annotation techniques used are not provided.
