The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a U-Net-like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions the implementation of a U-Net-like CNN using the Keras framework and TensorFlow as the backend. The model architecture is also described in detail, including the number of layers, depth, layer rate, batch normalization, residual connections, and dropout. The use of a U-Net-like CNN is further confirmed by the mention of the model's performance on image segmentation tasks, such as forest damage segmentation.
