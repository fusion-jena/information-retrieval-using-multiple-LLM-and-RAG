Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for predicting forest canopy cover using satellite images and other data sources. It mentions various machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and LightGBM, but does not provide information on the datasets used.

However, it does mention that the study used Planet data, which suggests that the dataset may be a collection of satellite images from Planet Labs. Additionally, the context mentions the use of LiDAR data, which is a remote sensing technology that uses laser light to create high-resolution images of the Earth's surface.

Overall, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
