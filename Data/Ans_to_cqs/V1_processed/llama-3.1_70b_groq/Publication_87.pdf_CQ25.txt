The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically for the identification of animal species in large amounts of images. The model is trained on a dataset of labelled images and then used to predict the species of animals in new, unlabelled images. The model architecture used is a resnet18 (although a resnet50 was used to get the full results presented in the main text), and the model is trained using a workflow in R. The goal of the model is to automate the identification of animal species, which is a repetitive analysis task in ecology.
