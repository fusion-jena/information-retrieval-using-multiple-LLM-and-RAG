Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context only mentions that data augmentation was applied to all extracted patches, which includes a 90âˆ˜ rotation and vertical and horizontal flips. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps that may have been performed.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, beyond the data augmentation techniques mentioned.
