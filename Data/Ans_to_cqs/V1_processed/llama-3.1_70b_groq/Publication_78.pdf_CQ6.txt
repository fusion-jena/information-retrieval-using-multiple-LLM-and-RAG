The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the image is "segmentized and divided into small patches" and that features are extracted from each patch using handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs. This suggests that some form of preprocessing is involved, but the specific steps are not detailed.

The context does mention the use of a visual vocabulary (VV) which is created from the features extracted from the patches. This VV is then used to train a classifier, such as SVM. However, the context does not provide information on whether the features are normalized, scaled, or cleaned before being used to train the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing is involved, but the specific steps are not mentioned.
