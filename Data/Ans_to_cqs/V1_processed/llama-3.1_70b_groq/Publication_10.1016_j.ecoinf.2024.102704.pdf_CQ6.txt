Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance optimization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), model training, and detection accuracy. It discusses the importance of reducing memory access, reconfiguring computation sequences, and the impact of model depth and width on performance. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or details, I would be happy to try and assist you.
