Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, feature extraction, and classification results. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the input data is mentioned to be in the form of WT spectrum, HHT spectrum, and STFT spectrum, which are likely to be preprocessed versions of the original data. Additionally, the context mentions that the datasets are divided into training and test sets, which might involve some form of data splitting or preprocessing. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned in the provided context.
