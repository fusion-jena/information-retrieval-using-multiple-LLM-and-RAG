The purpose of the machine learning models (MLMs) used in this work is to determine the relative critical attributes from forest fire dynamics and to predict the occurrence of forest fires. The models are used for classification, as they are trained on a dataset of forest fire occurrence data and validated using a 10-fold cross-validation design. The goal is to identify the most important factors that influence forest fire dynamics and to develop a reliable and efficient means of predicting forest fire occurrence. The models are not used for segmentation or detection, but rather for classification and prediction.
