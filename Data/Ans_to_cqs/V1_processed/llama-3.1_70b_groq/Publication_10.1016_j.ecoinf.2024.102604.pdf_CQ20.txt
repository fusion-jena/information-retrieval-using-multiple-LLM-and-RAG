I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and environmental covariates, but it does not provide any details about the computational resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
