I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, wetland management, and earth observation, with references to academic papers on topics such as wetland use intensity, ecosystem health, and remote sensing. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
