I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, biodiversity data, and species distribution modeling, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
