The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for recording the ocean's soundscape over larger temporal and spatial scales. This suggests that sensors are likely used for collecting raw data. The context also mentions the use of a dataset for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, but it does not specify the source of the dataset or the methods used for collecting the data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that sensors, such as those used in PAM, are likely used for collecting raw data. However, the exact methods used for collecting the data, such as surveys or public datasets, are not specified in the provided context.
