Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that the model was trained for 40 epochs with data augmentation of random flips and translations, and that the RGB channels were normalized by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel. Additionally, it mentions that the model was retrained using the hand-annotated data, but it does not provide further details on the hyperparameters used.
