I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on time series forecasting, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and feature selection methods, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
