I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It discusses the architecture of the model (deeplabv3 + resnet269), the threshold for filtering out negligible values, and the computational efficiency of the system, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used during training.
