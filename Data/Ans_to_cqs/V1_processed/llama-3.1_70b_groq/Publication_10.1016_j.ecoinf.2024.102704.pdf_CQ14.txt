Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on the performance of various YOLO models (YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) across different scales (n, s, m, and l) and their impact on detection accuracy and inference speed. It also mentions the use of LigObNet, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.

However, it does mention the optimization of detection accuracy and inference speed by the C1 module, as shown in Figure 3. But it does not provide further details on how this optimization is achieved.

Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameter optimization technique used in this context.
