I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper about forestry and ecological informatics, discussing methods for estimating tree diversity indices. There is no mention of a data repository or a deep learning pipeline, so I am unable to provide an answer to this question.
