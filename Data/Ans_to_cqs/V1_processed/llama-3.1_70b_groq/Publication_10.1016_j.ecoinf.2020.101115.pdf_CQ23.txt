Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the design of a database for storing ecological sample data, specifically fish samples, and ensuring that the data is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). There is no mention of deep learning models or measures taken to ensure their generalizability.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
