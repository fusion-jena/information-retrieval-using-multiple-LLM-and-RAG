According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data augmentation techniques such as:

1. Scaling
2. Panning
3. Rotation
4. Colour transformation
5. Mosaic

These techniques were employed to increase the number of training samples and improve model generalization ability. Additionally, the input image size was set to 512 Ã— 512, which may involve resizing or cropping the images to a uniform size.

It is also mentioned that the models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2, which may involve normalization or scaling of the learning rate. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the input data was normalized or scaled.

Therefore, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data augmentation techniques and possibly resizing or cropping the images, but it is unclear if normalization or scaling of the input data was performed.
