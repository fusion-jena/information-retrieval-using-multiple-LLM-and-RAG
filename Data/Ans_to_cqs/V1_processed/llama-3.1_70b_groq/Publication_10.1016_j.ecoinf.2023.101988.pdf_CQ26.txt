Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, wildlife surveys, and statistical analysis, but it does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
