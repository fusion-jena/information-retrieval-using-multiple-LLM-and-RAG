Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the data splitting strategy, where the integrity of capture events is maintained by keeping all images of an event in the same dataset. It also mentions the use of the PyTorch 1.7.1 platform and the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9 for model training, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
