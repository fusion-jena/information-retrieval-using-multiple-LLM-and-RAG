Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental science, but it does not provide information on the development or evaluation of a specific deep learning model.

However, some of the references mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation (e.g., Marrs and Ni-Meister, 2019) and the integration of multiple data sources (e.g., Liu et al., 2022), which could be related to ensuring the generalizability of a model. Nevertheless, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not contain sufficient information to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
