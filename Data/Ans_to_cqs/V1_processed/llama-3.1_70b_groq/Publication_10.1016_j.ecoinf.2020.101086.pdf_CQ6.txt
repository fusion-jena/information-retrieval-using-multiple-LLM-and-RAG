Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning models or the preprocessing steps involved in training such models. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and ecological studies, discussing topics such as parameterization of correction methods, environmental space, and sampling effort.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model, as it is not relevant to the provided context.
