Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and fragments of text, possibly from a technical document or academic paper.

However, I can tell you that MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are popular datasets commonly used in deep learning research and development. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, CIFAR is a dataset of small images, and ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of images.

If you're looking for information on specific datasets used in a particular deep learning pipeline, I would recommend checking the documentation or research paper associated with that pipeline. Without more context or information, I'm unable to provide a more specific answer.
