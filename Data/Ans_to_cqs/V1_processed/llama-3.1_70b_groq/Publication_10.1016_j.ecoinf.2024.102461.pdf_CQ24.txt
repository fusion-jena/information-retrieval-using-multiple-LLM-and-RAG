I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to a study on fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, and does not discuss deep learning or strategies for handling randomness.
