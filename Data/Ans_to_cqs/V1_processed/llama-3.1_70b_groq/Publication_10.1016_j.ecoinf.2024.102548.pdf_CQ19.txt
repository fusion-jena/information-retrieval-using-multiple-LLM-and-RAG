I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). It discusses various aspects of neural networks, such as total model parameters, total layers, and specific architectures like ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2. However, it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models.
