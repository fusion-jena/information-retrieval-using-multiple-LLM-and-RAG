Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions the number of epochs (400) and batch size (8) that were determined to be optimal through initial computational experiments. It does not provide information on other hyperparameters that may have been used.
