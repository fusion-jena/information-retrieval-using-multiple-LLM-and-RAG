Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context only mentions that the deep learning architecture HerdNet3 was used for processing aerial survey images, and that it was previously used in a SRF-OCC study (Delplanque et al., 2023b). However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used to train or test the HerdNet3 model.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that the HerdNet3 model was used to process a large dataset of aerial survey images, consisting of 190,686 images, from which 148,239 appeared on transect after cleaning. However, this is not a standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather a custom dataset collected for the specific task of wildlife population estimation.
