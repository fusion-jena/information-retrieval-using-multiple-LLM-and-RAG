Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a GitHub link in reference 28: https://github.com/reachsumit/deep-unet-for-satellite-image-segmentation/. But this link is not related to the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, but rather a general deep U-net for satellite image segmentation.
