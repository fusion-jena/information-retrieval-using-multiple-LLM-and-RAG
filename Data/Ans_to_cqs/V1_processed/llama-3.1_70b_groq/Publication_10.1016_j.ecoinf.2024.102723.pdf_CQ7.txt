The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a 10-fold Cross Validation was performed to have a reliable estimate of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation subsets, but the exact criteria or ratio used for the split is not specified.
