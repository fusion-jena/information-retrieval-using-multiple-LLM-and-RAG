Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, infrastructure, and results of the model training process. It discusses the preprocessing of historical images, model training and validation, prediction making, and ground truth validation, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention "prediction making" (sec. 3.1 and sec. 3.3) and "ground truth validation" (sec. 2.5 and sec. 3.4) as part of the methodology, which might imply some form of evaluation or analysis of the model's performance. Nevertheless, without further information, it is impossible to provide a detailed answer to the query.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
