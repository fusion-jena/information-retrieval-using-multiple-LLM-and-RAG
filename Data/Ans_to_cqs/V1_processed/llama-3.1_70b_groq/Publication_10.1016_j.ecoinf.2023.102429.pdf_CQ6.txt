The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention data pre-processing in the context of spectral analysis. According to the text, data pre-processing was performed in ViewSpecPro and the Unscrambler.

Additionally, the text mentions various preprocessing methods used in the context of Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), including:

* RL (Raw data with no preprocessing)
* FD (First derivative)
* SD (Second derivative)
* MSC (Multiplicative Scatter Correction)
* RL (Raw data with no preprocessing)

These preprocessing methods are used to preprocess spectral data before applying PLSR. However, it is not clear if these methods are also applicable to deep learning models.

In general, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. However, the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the type of data and the specific deep learning model being used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that data pre-processing was performed, but I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
