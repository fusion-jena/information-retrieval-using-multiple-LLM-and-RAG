I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on data sharing, repositories, and FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of research data, rather than deep learning or computer vision techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
