Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the required steps in the machine learning (ML) workflows, classifier training performance, and hyperparameters. 

However, it does mention that the workflow stages can be found in Supplementary Table 1, which is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to the query.
