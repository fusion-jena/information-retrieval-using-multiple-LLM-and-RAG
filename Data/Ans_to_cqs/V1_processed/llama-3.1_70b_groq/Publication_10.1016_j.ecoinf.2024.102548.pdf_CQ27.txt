Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the model's architecture, training parameters, and performance evaluation, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

However, it does mention that high-parameter models can escalate computational and memory requirements, potentially impeding deployment in resource-constrained environments. This suggests that the authors may have considered the deployment challenges, but the actual deployment process is not described.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
