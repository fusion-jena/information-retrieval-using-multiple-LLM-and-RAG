Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the network architecture, experimental design, and results of a series of ablation experiments. It discusses the use of various modules, such as the SPPF module, attention mechanism, and feature fusion techniques, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
