Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of fusion quality, feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV), and the combination of base models to obtain the final prediction results.

However, it does mention the use of a meta-model (RF algorithm) to generate prediction results and the calculation of classification results through voting. Additionally, the context mentions the use of cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model, but it does not provide further details on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
