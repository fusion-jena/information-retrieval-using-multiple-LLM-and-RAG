Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Field data collection: The context mentions "field data" as a keyword, suggesting that data is collected through field observations or measurements.
2. Remote sensing: The context mentions "remote sensing" as a keyword, indicating that data is collected through satellite or aerial imagery.
3. Public datasets: The context mentions the use of public datasets, such as those provided by the USGS EarthExplorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), which suggests that publicly available data is used to supplement the dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of SRTM DEM data, which is a type of remote sensing data. It also mentions the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, which is a type of remote sensing data used to estimate vegetation health.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the context whether surveys or sensors are used for collecting raw data. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing and field data collection are the primary methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
