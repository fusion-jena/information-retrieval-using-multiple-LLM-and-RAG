Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training phase of a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) and the selection of optimal hyperparameters. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been performed on the data before training the model.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention that the input layer had 23 neurons, correlating with predictors, which suggests that some form of feature selection or engineering may have been performed on the data. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
