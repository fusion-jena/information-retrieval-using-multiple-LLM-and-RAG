Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context mentions that the site provides an interface for training and storing models using its computational resources, but it does not specify the type of hardware resources used, such as GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
