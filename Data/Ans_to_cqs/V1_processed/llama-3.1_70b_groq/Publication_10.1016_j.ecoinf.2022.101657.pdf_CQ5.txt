Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on camera trap data and wildlife monitoring, with references to various research papers and studies on image classification, object detection, and species identification.

The context mentions the use of camera trap data, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the datasets used are custom or specific to the wildlife monitoring domain, but without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this question.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
