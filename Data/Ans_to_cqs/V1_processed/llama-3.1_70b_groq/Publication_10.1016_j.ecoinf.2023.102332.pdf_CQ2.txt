The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to text mining, word embeddings, and natural language processing, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is text data, likely in the form of CSV or plain text files.

The context mentions the use of the "tm" text mining package in R, which suggests that the data is in a text format. Additionally, the references to word2vec, BERT, and other natural language processing techniques imply that the data is text-based.

There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning pipeline is focused on processing text data.

It's worth noting that the context does mention the use of social media data, which could potentially include images, videos, or other multimedia formats. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the focus is on text data.
