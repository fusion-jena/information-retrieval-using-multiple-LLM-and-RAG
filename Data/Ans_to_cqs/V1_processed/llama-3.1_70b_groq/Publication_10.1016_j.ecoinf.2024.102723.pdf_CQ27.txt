Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the architecture and implementation of the neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras, as well as the performance evaluation of the models. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
