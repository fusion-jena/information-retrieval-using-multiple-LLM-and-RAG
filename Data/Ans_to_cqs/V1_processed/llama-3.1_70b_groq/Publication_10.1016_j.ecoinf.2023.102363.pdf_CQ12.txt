The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the EfficientNet B0 network. This is mentioned in the context as "The model is constructed using the EfficientNet B0 network (Tan and Le, 2019) which had been trained for generic image classification."
