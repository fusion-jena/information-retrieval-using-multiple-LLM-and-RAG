The criteria used to determine when training is complete is the loss rate of the model being less than a preset threshold ɛ (specifically, ɛ = 1.0 × 10^−4). This is mentioned in the context as the iteration termination condition of the model, which is the same in each round of training. There is no mention of a validation loss plateau or other criteria being used to determine when training is complete.
