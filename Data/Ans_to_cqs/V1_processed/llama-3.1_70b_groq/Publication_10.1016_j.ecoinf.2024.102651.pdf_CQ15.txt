Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the proposed classification network, CA-Hybrid, and its comparison with other networks like ResNet and ViT. It discusses the use of residual structures, CAM, and the integration of CNN and ViT modules, but does not provide information on optimization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
