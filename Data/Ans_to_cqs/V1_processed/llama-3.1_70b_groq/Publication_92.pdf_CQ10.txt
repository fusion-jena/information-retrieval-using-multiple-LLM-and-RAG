Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or a technical report discussing the use of deep learning for coral reef fish detection and recognition in underwater videos, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
