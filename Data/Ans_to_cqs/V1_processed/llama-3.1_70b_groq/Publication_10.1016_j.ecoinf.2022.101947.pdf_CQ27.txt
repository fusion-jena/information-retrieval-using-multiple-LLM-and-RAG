Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on Amur tigers, specifically on the use of a classification dendrogram to identify individual tigers based on their footprints. It discusses the collection of trail data, the formation of sub-trails, and the use of an algorithm to classify the trails. However, it does not provide information on the deployment of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
