The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the input parameters were "statistically resampled" before being utilized in establishing the linear and nonlinear relationship to better fit the occurrence scenarios of the species. This suggests that some form of data resampling or preprocessing was performed, but the exact details are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the performance of the model was evaluated using the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics, which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. However, it does not provide information on whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
