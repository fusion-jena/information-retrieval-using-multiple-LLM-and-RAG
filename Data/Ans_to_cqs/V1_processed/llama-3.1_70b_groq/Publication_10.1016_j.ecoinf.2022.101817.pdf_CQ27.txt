Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the training and validation of the CNN models, specifically the VGG16 architecture, and the performance of the models on the environmental condition classification task. It also mentions the use of software-based monitoring for power consumption measurements, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
