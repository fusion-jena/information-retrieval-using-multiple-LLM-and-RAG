Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The text mentions the use of deep learning models for plant leaf recognition and classification, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. It mentions the use of a "deep convolutional neural network" in one of the references (Pushpa, B.R., Rani, N.S., 2023), but it does not specify the framework used to build this network. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the context.
