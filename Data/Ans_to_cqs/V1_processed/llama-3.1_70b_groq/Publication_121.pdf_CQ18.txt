The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored through the use of training and validation accuracy metrics. 

The context mentions that the training and validation accuracies were between 92%-94% and 82%-86%, respectively, for the MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based transfer learned models. Additionally, it mentions that the training and validation accuracies of the fine-tuned models were plotted in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. This suggests that the model performance was monitored and evaluated using these metrics during the training process.
