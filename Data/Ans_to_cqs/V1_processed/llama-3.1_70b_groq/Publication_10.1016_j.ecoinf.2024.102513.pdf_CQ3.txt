Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the neural network architecture, pooling layers, attention mechanisms, and transfer learning techniques, but does not delve into data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
