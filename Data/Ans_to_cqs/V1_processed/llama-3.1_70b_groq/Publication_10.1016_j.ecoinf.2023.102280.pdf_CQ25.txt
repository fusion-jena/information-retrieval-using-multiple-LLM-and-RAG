The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is noise reduction, specifically denoising audio signals. The models mentioned, such as U-net architectures and transformer attention mechanisms, are designed to remove noise from audio waveforms, resulting in a cleaner signal. This is often applied to natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as human speech enhancement, but also has applications in bioacoustics, where it can be used to denoise animal vocalizations. The models can operate on audio spectrograms or raw waveform data, and some recent methods have successfully used raw waveform data for wider applications such as source separation and classification.
