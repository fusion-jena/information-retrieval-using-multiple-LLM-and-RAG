I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of deep learning in the paper "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022), but it does not provide details on the architecture of the model used. The context also mentions the use of other machine learning models such as Random Forests (RF), Generalized Boosting Models (GBM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), but it does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used.
