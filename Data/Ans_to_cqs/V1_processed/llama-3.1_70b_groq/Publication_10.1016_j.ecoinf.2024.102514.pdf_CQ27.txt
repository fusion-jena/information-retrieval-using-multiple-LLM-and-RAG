Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the analysis of input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross-validation for a recurrent neural network model on waste disposal rate estimation, as well as the application of machine learning technologies to predict heavy metals in soil and pollution indices in mining areas. It also discusses the ranking of models based on various statistical measures and data splitting ratios for training and testing datasets. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
