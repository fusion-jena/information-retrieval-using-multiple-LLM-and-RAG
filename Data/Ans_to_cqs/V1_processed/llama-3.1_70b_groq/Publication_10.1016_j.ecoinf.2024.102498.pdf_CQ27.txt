Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context does mention the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for training and validating machine learning models, including CART, RF, GTB, and SVM. However, it does not provide details on how the trained models were deployed or if model serialization was used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
