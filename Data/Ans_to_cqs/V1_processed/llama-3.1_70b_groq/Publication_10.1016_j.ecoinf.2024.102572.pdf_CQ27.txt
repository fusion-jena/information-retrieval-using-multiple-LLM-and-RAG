Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the data processing and calculation steps performed within Google Earth Engine (GEE) to produce a time series dataset, including land cover types, wildfire locations, NBR, and above-ground biomass data in mainland China. It also mentions the use of machine learning techniques to classify fire-damaged monuments, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
