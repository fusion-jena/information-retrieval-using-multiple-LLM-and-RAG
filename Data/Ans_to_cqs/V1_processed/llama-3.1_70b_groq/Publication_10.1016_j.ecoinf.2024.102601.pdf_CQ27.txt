Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of data structures, hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
