To ensure the generalizability of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was randomly split into two sets: 80% for model training and 20% for model testing (validation set). This splitting helps to prevent overfitting by evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

Secondly, an early stopping technique was employed to prevent overfitting. The training process was stopped when the network began to overfit the data, i.e., when the error on the validation set started to increase.

Thirdly, a trial-and-error method was used to determine the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate. The number of nodes in the hidden layer was varied between 5 and 23, and the learning rate was varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in increments of 0.05. The mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data was calculated for each configuration, and the optimal number of neurons and learning rate were selected based on the minimum MSE.

Lastly, the model's performance was evaluated using the mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data. This evaluation metric helps to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting in the provided context. However, the measures taken, such as early stopping, trial-and-error method, and evaluation using MSE, help to ensure the generalizability of the ANN model.
