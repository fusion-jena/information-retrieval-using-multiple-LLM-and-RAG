The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors combine data from a broad and diverse range of databases, such as EMODnet, UNEP, and CMEMS, to examine the presence-absence of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean Sea.

It can be inferred that the authors are using existing public datasets as a source of raw data. The context does not provide information on whether surveys or sensors are used to collect data. It only mentions that the authors are using data from various databases, which suggests that they are relying on existing data sources rather than collecting new data through surveys or sensors.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that public datasets are being used as a source of raw data in this study. However, it is not possible to determine whether surveys or sensors are also being used without additional information.
