Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the study are primarily remote sensing data, specifically:

* Multispectral images (GF-1) with four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared
* SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery (GF-3)
* MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) images

These data formats are all related to image data, specifically satellite and aerial imagery. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the study. Additionally, while CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common data format, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as being used in the study.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data formats used in the study are primarily image data formats, specifically multispectral, SAR, and NDVI images.
