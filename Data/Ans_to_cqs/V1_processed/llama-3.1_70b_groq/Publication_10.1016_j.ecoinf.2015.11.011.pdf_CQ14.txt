Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) with a Markovian random field (MRF) basis and a quasi-binomial family, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It only mentions that the models were fit at all scales for all four sites independently and that multiple comparisons were corrected for using the 'false discovery rate' method. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
