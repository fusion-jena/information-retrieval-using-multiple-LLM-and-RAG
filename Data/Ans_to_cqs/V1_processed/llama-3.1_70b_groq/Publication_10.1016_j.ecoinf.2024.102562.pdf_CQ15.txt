Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions the use of transfer learning, image augmentations, and training of the model for a certain number of epochs, but it does not specify the optimization techniques used, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
