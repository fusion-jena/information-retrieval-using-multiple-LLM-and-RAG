The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline primarily deals with image data. The context mentions "automatic image classification", "camera trap images", and "image recognition", indicating that the pipeline is designed to process and classify images. There is no mention of audio or video data formats. Additionally, the context mentions the use of R-scripts and R packages, which are commonly used for data manipulation and analysis, but does not specifically mention CSV as a data format used in the pipeline. Therefore, the answer is that the pipeline primarily uses image data formats.
