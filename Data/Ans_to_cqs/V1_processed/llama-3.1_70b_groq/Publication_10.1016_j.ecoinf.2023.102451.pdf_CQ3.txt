I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the EMViT-Net framework, its architecture, and its performance on the EMDS-6 dataset, but it does not provide information on how the data was annotated. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
