The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the TrunkNet, is evaluated using seven metrics. These metrics include:

1. Mean Absolute Error (M): This metric assesses the pixel-level similarity between the final saliency map Spre and the ground-truth mask G.

2. F-measure (Fβ): This metric estimates the harmonic mean of precision and recall by combining them together into a single statistic Fβ.

3. Weighted F-measure (Fωβ): This metric introduces weight ω to handle the unreasonable comparison caused by flaws of prediction and represents error at different locations.

Additionally, the maximum Fβ (denoted by maxFβ) is also reported in the analysis of experimental results.

Note that the provided context does not mention accuracy as one of the evaluation metrics. However, it does mention precision and recall, which are components of the F-measure and Weighted F-measure metrics.
