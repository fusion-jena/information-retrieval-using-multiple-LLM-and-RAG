The text does not mention the use of specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it mentions the use of a ground-truth imagery dataset that was developed for the study, which consists of annotated images used to train the deep learning models. Additionally, it mentions the use of 2012 aerial imagery data, which is available at https://git.wur.nl/deep-learning-tools-for-marine-ecosystem-monitoring.
