Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only provides information on the model architecture (Inception v3), the loss function (cross-entropy), and the training procedure, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
