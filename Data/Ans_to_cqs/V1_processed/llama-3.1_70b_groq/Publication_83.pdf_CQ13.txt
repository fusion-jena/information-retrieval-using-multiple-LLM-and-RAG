The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- Optimizer: Adam optimizer
- Learning rate: 10âˆ’4
- Loss function: Categorical cross entropy
- Batch size: 64 samples
- Number of epochs: 200

These hyperparameters are used to train the VGG style network, which is the feature learning part of the proposed model.
