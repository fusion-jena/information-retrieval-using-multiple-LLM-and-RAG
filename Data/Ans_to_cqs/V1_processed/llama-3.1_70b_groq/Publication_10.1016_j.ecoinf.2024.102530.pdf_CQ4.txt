I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on land use/land cover mapping, pollination modeling, and fuzzy inference systems, but it does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
