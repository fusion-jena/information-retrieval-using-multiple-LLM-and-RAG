I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. The context discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT), but it does not mention deep learning models.
