Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on forestry and remote sensing, discussing topics such as forest management, carbon sequestration, and the use of LiDAR and machine learning methods for estimating above-ground biomass. It does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or random seed values. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
