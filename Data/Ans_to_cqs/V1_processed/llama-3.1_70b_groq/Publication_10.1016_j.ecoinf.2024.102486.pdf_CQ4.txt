Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, Scaling, etc. The context appears to be focused on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, particle filters, and parallel computing, rather than deep learning.

However, I can suggest that the context does mention "Data augmentation approaches for improving animal audio classification" in the paper "Nanni, L., Maguolo, G., Paci, M., 2020. Data augmentation approaches for improving animal audio classification. Eco. Inform. 57, 101084." But it does not provide specific details on the techniques used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
