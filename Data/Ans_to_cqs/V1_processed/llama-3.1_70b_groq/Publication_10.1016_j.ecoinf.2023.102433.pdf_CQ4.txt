I don't know. The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing remote sensing images, data ingestion, and a NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
