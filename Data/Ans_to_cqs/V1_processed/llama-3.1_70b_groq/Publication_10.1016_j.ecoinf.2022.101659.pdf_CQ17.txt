I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to a study on bivalve species, specifically their gaping behavior, and its relation to metabolic functions, environmental variables, and bioenergetic models. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning concepts.
