Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the potential biases in the input data, such as species detection bias and heterogeneous sampling effort, but it does not provide information on how these biases are addressed during preprocessing.

However, it is mentioned that the model is trained on presence-only data, all species combined (multi-species SDM), which might imply that the data is not stratified or split in a specific way to address bias. Additionally, the text does not mention any techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
