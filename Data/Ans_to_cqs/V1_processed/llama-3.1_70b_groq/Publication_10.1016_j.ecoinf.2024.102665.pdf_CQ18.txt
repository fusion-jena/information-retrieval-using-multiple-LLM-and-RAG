Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be focused on the use of the MWST (Minimum-Weight Spanning Tree) algorithm for clustering and network analysis, as well as various studies related to coral reefs and marine ecosystems. There is no mention of model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
