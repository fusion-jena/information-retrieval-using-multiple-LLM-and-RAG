Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a research paper or report discussing the application of deep learning models in assessing the impact of flooding on freshwater fish and detecting the dispersal of fish in northern Vietnam. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

The context does mention the use of XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, for land use/land cover classification accuracy and forest types accuracy, but it does not provide details on the dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting used in the study.

Therefore, I do not know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in this study.
