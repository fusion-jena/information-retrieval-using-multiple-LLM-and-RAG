The hyperparameters of the models are optimized through a systematic evaluation of different combinations of parameters. For the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, the hyperparameters "mtry" and "ntree" are evaluated systematically to strike a balance between stability and minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Specifically, "mtry" is evaluated from 1 to 10.

For the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the hyperparameters "size" (number of units in the hidden layer) and "decay" (regularization parameter to avoid overfitting) are passed as arrays of 1-20 and 0.025-1, respectively. The optimum combination of parameters for the best model fit is based on accuracy.

It appears that a form of grid search is used to optimize the hyperparameters, where a range of values for each hyperparameter is systematically evaluated to find the best combination. However, it is not explicitly stated whether a grid search or random search is used.
