The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), is land use and land cover (LULC) classification. The text states that CNNs are "highly effective for LULC classification" and that they can "automatically extract hierarchical features at various scales, encompassing edges, textures, and more intricate elements." Additionally, RNNs are mentioned as being able to "learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns continuously," allowing them to capture temporal shifts and variations in land cover patterns. The overall goal of using deep learning techniques in this context is to generate accurate and dynamic LULC maps by leveraging satellite imagery and real-time observations.
