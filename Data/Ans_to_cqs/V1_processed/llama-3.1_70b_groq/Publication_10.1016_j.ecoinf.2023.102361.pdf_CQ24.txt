Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the dataset splitting, deep learning models, and their performance evaluation. It does mention that the datasets were "randomly divided" into training, validation, and testing sets, but it does not provide any information on how randomness was handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know what strategies were employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, and I cannot provide a more specific answer to this question.
