I don't know. The provided context does not mention the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. It appears to be focused on the development of a crawling tool for retrieving data from satellite instruments and the characteristics of those instruments, as well as in situ monitoring data. There is no mention of deep learning models or the hardware resources used for training them.
