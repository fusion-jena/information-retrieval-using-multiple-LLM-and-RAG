I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on soil sampling and analysis, land use and land cover, and remote sensing image processing. It includes references to various research papers and geographic information systems (GIS), but it does not provide any information about a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
