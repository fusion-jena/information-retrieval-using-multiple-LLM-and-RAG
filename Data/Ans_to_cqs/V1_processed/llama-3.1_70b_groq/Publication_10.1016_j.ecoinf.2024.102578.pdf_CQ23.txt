The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that "region-specific models performed better" and that separate two-class models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal, suggesting that the model was adapted to specific contexts. This could imply that the model was trained on data from different regions, which might help improve its generalizability. Additionally, the use of a large number of epochs (55) and a batch size of 64 might help the model learn from a large amount of data and reduce overfitting. However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure generalizability.
