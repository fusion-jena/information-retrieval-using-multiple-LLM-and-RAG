Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the architecture of the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN), the feature extraction process, and the classification workflow using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

However, it does mention that the labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing datasets, and that 50% of the training data were held-out for validation. This suggests that some form of data splitting was used, but it does not provide information on whether techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were employed to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
