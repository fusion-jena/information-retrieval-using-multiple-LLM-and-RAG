Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the computation of top-1 classification accuracy in Section 4.3, but the details of this section are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of deconvolutional networks, which are often used to visualize the features learned by a model. Specifically, it mentions the visualization of the response of selected filter units in layer 4, which suggests that some form of feature visualization or saliency map computation may be involved. However, this is not explicitly stated as a postprocessing step.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that top-1 classification accuracy is computed, but I do not know the other postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as metrics calculation or confusion matrix generation.
