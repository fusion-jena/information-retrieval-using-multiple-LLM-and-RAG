Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to wildlife ecology, statistical computing, and research papers, but it does not touch on deep learning or machine learning pipelines.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
