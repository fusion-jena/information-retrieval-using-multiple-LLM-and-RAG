The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image, specifically spectrogram images. These images are generated from unfiltered waveforms and are fed into the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction. The CNN is pre-trained on millions of label images in over 1000 categories, and the activations from the fully connected layer are used as a feature vector for each detected signal. The feature vector is then used for classification by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
