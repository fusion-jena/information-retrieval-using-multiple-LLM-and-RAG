I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only mentions that deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, were used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide information on how these models were deployed. The context focuses on the methodologies used for species distribution modeling, the types of models used, and the results of these models, but it does not provide details on the deployment process of the trained models.
