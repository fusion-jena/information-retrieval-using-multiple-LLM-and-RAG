Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, its architecture, and its applications in computer vision tasks. It also mentions some related works and references, but it does not discuss data preprocessing techniques or strategies to address data bias.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed common techniques used to address data bias and imbalance in machine learning datasets. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class.

Diverse data collection is also an important strategy to address data bias, as it involves collecting data from diverse sources and environments to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the population.

If you're looking for specific information on how these techniques are applied in the context of the Vision Transformer or deep learning pipelines, I'm afraid the provided context does not provide enough information to answer your question.
