Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework, to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters that minimizes the mean squared error. Optuna employs complex optimization algorithms, but the specific techniques used are not specified.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the optimization of hyperparameters such as the kernel function, epsilon, regularization parameter (C), and degree, which are relevant to Support Vector Regression (SVR) models, but not specifically to deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
