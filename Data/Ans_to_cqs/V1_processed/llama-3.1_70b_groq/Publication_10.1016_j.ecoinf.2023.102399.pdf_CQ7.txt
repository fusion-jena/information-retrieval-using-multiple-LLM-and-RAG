Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be a research paper on a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural networks, but it does not provide information on the data splitting process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
