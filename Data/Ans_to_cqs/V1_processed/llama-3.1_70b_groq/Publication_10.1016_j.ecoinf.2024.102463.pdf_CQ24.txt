Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on Hyperband, a method for efficient hyperparameter optimization, and some details about neural network architectures and their applications.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Typically, randomness is handled by setting a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of results. This is often done using libraries like NumPy or PyTorch, which provide functions to set the random seed.

Additionally, some deep learning frameworks and libraries provide built-in mechanisms to handle randomness, such as random number generators or seed management. But without more specific information, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this question.

In the context of Hyperband, the initial random search might involve randomness, but the provided text does not elaborate on how this randomness is handled. If you have more specific information or context about the deep learning pipeline you are referring to, I might be able to provide a more detailed answer.
