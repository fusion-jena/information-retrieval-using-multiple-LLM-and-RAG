The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "data splitting" as a procedure used in the research, specifically highlighting the limitations of weak validation procedures like random data splitting. 

It also mentions "image tiling" as a technique used to separate sticky plate images into regions of interest of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) that contain the maximum number of complete bounding boxes. 

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context.
