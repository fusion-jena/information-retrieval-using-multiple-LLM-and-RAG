Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study involving photography and sampling of organisms, and it provides details on the study's design, methodology, and data collection. However, it does not mention deep learning models or any measures taken to ensure their generalizability.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query. If you could provide more context or clarify the relationship between the study and the deep learning model, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
