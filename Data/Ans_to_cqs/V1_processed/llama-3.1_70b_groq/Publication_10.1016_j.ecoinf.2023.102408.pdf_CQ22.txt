The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models are R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). These three error statistics are employed to compare the accuracies of the models. Additionally, the coefficient of variation is used to quantify the variation in model prediction, which signifies the prediction uncertainty.
