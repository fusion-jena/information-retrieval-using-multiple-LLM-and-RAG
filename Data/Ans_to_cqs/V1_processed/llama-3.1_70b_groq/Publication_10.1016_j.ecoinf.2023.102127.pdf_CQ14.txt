Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses model evaluation, different engines, and references various papers on species distribution models, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.

However, it does mention "Regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent" in the context of Friedman et al. (2010), which suggests that coordinate descent may be used for optimizing model parameters. Nevertheless, this is not explicitly stated as a hyperparameter optimization technique.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
