The deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context uses color spectrograms as inputs, which are derived from audio data. Specifically, the pipeline uses RGB images of 224x224x3 as inputs, where each image represents a two-second duration of audio data. This suggests that the pipeline is using a visual representation of audio data, rather than raw audio or other formats such as video or CSV.
