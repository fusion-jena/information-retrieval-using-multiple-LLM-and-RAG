The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This is mentioned in the reference to Babaee et al. (2017), which discusses "A deep convolutional neural network for background subtraction." Additionally, the text mentions the use of a pre-trained model, specifically an "inception" model, which is a type of CNN architecture.
