Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction, crop phenology detection, and remote sensing, but it does not mention the deployment process of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
