Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper on evaluating the performance of different machine learning methods (indiv, knn, kmeans, random, CF, LoopA, LoopT, LoopE) with and without bias correction and Lasso regularization. The context includes tables and figures showing the results of the evaluation, but it does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
