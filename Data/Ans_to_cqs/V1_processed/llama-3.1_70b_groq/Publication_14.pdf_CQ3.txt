Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research project involving animal detection in camera trap images, specifically hummingbirds, using deep learning models. However, it does not provide specific details on the data annotation techniques used.

The context mentions the use of a pre-trained hummingbird model and the ability to train new models using reproducible scripts, but it does not elaborate on the annotation process. It also mentions the use of a semi-automated system for animal detection, called AnimalFinder, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used in this system.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
