I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the analysis of key features in filamentous organisms, specifically the Rhizophagus irregularis fungus, and presents some results of the analysis, including visualizations of the network structure and estimates of the number of biological nodes. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method is used.
