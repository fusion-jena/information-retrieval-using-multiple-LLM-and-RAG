The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the calculation of certain metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for different models, including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5s, and the Proposed Method. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold of 0.7 during testing, which is a common postprocessing step in object detection tasks. 

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the given information.
