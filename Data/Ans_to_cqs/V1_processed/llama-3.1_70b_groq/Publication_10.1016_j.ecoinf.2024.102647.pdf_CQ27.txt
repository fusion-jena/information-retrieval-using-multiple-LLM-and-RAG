I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the evaluation of machine learning models for predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps, including the performance statistics of different models such as Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of these models, including model serialization or platform selection.
