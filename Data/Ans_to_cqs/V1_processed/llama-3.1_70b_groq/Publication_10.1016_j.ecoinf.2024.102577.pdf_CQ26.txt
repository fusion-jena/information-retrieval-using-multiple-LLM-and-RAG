Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to marine ecology, tuna migration patterns, and oceanographic data, with some references to machine learning and data analysis. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines.

That being said, the context does mention some general data analysis and machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, and Na√Øve Bayes, but it does not provide information on how these techniques are used to address data bias.

Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not contain the information necessary to answer the query. If you're looking for information on techniques used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines, you may want to consult a different source.
