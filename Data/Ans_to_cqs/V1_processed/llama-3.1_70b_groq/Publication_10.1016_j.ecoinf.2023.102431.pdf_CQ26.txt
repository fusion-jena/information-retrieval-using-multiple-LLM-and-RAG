The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention two potential sources of bias that were evaluated in the study: foot position bias and observer bias.

To evaluate foot position bias, the study recorded the foot position (left-front or right-front) of each track during the feature extraction process. This suggests that the study considered the potential impact of using mirrored right front tracks instead of only left front tracks on the analysis.

To evaluate observer bias, the study had 3 different observers manually mark the landmark points in the FIT interface. This suggests that the study considered the potential impact of subjective observer bias on the analysis.

The study does not mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, which are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines. It also does not mention diverse data collection as a technique used to address bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
