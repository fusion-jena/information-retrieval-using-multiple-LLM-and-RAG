Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text discusses the classification algorithms used, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it is mentioned that hyperparameter tuning was performed using validation data (10% of training data), which suggests that the model's performance on the validation set was monitored during training. But the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
