Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the deep learning approach used for automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls, specifically discussing the modifications made to the BatNet model and the optimization of parameter settings. It mentions the use of a reference dataset, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this context.
