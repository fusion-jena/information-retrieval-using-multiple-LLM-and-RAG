Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context only discusses the architecture of the deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, including the number of neurons, activation functions, and implementation details using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
