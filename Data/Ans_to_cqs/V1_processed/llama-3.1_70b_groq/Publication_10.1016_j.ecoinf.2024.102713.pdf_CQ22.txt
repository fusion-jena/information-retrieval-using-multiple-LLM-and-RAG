I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a data platform and database schema for a system called CASE, which is used for precision agriculture applications. It discusses the data sources, data model, and analytical capabilities, but does not mention deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
