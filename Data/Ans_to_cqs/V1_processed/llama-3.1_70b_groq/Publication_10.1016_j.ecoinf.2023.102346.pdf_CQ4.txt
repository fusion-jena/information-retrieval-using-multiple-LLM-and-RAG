Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on various topics in ecology, biology, and environmental science, including species distribution modeling, microbiology, and climate change. It also mentions some technical aspects, such as the use of the R programming language and the "raster" package for resampling operations.

However, I can suggest that data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, particularly in computer vision tasks, to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization. But without more specific information, I cannot provide a detailed answer to the query.
