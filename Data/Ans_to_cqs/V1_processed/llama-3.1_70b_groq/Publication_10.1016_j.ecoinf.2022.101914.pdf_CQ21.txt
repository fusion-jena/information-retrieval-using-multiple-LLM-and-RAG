Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context only discusses the procedure used to build models, including data preparation, scale optimization, subsampling background points, training component models, and evaluating them using the evaluation dataset with metrics like AUC and TSS. It does not provide information on any postprocessing steps that may be performed after model training. 

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
