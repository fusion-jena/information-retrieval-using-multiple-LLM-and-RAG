Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, fine-tuning, and the Semi-Automatic Loop (SAL) pipeline.

However, it does mention that during the SAL pipeline, a human-expert interpreter manually classifies each thumbnail as either False Positive (FP), True Positive (TP), or uncertain object. This step can be considered as a form of postprocessing, but it is not a traditional postprocessing step like Saliency maps or Metrics calculation.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If more context or information is provided, I may be able to give a more accurate answer.
