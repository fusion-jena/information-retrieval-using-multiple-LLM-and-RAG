I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to metadata templates for measurement data, including descriptions of measurement settings, installation details, and data file descriptions. It does not provide information on machine learning or model training processes. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
