The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, and validation accuracy. Specifically, the model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify images of red kites, with a training accuracy of 0.899 and a validation accuracy of 0.891. Additionally, the model's performance is also evaluated on an independent test set of 2060 images, where it achieves a precision of 0.992 when combining textual and visual analysis.
