Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the model selection, evaluation, and training process, including the use of a validation set, batch size, and number of iterations. It also mentions the use of a testing dataset with manually annotated images, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not know what data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
