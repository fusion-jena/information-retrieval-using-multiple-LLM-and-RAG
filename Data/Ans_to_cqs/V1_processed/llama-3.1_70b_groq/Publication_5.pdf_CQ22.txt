The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Bias, and Correlation. These metrics are compared with the performance of a Random Forest model. The values for the deep learning model are: MAE = 28.8105, RMSE = 38.5759, Bias = 10.2055, and Correlation = 0.9752.
