Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on transfer learning models, active learning strategies, and the evaluation of these models on various datasets. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
