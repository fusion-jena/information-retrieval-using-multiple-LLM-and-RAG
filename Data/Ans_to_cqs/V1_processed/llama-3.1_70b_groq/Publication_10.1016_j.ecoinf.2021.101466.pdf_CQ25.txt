The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection and classification. Specifically, the model uses a two-stage approach, where the first stage uses YOLOv4 as a region proposal network to detect candidate regions, and the second stage uses the EfficientNet as a classifier to re-identify the detected candidates. The EfficientNet is used to classify the detected objects into specific categories, and the model is trained using a dataset of images with data augmentation. The model's performance is evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, which measures the accuracy of the object detection and classification.
