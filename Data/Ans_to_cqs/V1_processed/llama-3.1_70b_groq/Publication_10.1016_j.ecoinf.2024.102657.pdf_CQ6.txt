According to the provided context, no additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms before training the CNN model. The goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible in order to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming. This suggests that the data was used in its raw form or with minimal preprocessing. However, it is not explicitly stated what specific preprocessing steps were involved or if any data cleaning or normalization was performed.
