Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to focus more on the architecture and training of various deep learning models, such as ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1. However, it does mention ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database, which suggests that public datasets might be one source of raw data. Additionally, it mentions submissions for pollinator conservation science, but it does not provide information on how the data for these submissions is collected. Therefore, the answer to this question cannot be fully determined based on the provided context.
