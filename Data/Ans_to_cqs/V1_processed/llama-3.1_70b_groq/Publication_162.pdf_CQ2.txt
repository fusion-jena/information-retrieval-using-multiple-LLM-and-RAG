The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses image data, specifically RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue, and Depth) images, as mentioned in the text. The use of depth information suggests that the pipeline may also utilize 3D data or point cloud data, but this is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of camera traps, which typically capture image data. The text also references the iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset, which is likely to contain image data.

There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not mentioned either, but they might be used for storing metadata or annotations for the images.

In summary, the pipeline appears to primarily use image data, specifically RGB-D images, but the exact data formats used are not explicitly stated.
