The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the cluster analysis function of Kaleidoscope (recognizer) are precision and recall rate. These two metrics are most commonly employed for assessing bird recognizer performance. Precision is estimated by dividing the number of true positives (Nighthawk vocalizations) by the total number of candidate sounds within the cluster “Nighthawk”. The recall rate is obtained by dividing the total number of true positives detected by Kaleidoscope by the total number of Nighthawk vocalization on the validation dataset.
