Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the development and evaluation of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine, for predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB). It also provides information on the data preprocessing, model fitting, and evaluation metrics used. However, it does not provide any details on the deployment process of the trained models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
