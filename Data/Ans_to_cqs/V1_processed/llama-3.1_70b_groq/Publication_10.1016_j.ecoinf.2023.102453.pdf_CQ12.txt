The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models, including Vision Transformers (ViT) and EfficientNetV2. Specifically, it mentions the use of MobileViT models, which are a type of Vision Transformer, and EfficientNetV2B0, which is a variant of the EfficientNetV2 family. Additionally, it mentions the use of transformer-based models such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, it does not mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in the pipeline.
