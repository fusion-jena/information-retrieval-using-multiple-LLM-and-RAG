The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the MLPnn-MC model, is pattern classification. According to the text, "the output layer provides the pattern classification." This suggests that the model is designed to classify input data into different categories or classes. The text also mentions that the model is used for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation, which involves predicting the future state of land use and land cover based on historical data and trends. Therefore, the model's primary purpose is classification, specifically predicting the class or category of land use and land cover for a given area.
