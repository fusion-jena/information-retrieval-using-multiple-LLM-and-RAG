The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the model hyperparameters were tuned using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation. This suggests that RMSE is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model, but it does not provide information on other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.
