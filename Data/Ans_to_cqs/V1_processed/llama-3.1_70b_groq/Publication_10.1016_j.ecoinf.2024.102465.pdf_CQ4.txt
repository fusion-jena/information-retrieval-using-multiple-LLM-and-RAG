Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the HRNet model, semantic segmentation, and the use of NLP models, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
