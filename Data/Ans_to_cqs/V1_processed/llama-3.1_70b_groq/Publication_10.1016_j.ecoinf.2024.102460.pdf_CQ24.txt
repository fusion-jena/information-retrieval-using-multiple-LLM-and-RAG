Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on land type conversion drivers, land-use dynamics, and various models like LSTM, FMOP, and MOP. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a "sampling rate" and "number of parallels" in the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to improve execution speed. This could be related to handling randomness, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
