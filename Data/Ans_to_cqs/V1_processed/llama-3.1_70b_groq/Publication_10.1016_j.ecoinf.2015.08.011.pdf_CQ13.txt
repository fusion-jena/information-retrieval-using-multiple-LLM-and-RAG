The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are as follows:

* Number of nodes in the hidden layer: 19
* Learning rate: 0.7
* Number of epochs: Not specified, but an early stopping technique was used to prevent overfitting
* Optimizer: Not specified, but the learning rate was varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in increments of 0.05 to find the optimal value
* Number of layers: 3 (input layer, hidden layer, and output layer)
* Number of neurons in the input layer: 5 (plus one node for bias)
* Number of neurons in the output layer: 1

These hyperparameters were selected using a trial-and-error method, where the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate were varied to find the optimal combination that resulted in the lowest mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data.
