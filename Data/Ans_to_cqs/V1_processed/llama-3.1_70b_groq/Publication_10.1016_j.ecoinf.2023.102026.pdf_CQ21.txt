Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the effects of resampling techniques on model training data, specifically bootstrapping, and the comparison of different algorithms, such as Generalised linear model and Random forest, in species distribution modelling.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
