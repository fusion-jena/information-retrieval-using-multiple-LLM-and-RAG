I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the use of any specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be related to a research study on the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models and environmental data. The study mentions the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forest (RF), but does not provide information on the deployment platform.
