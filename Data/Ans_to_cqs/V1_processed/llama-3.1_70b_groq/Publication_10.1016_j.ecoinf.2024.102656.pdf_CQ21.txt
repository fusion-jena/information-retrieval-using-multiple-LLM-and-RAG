Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on the context, it appears that the authors are discussing species distribution modeling and habitat conservation. 

In the context of species distribution modeling, the authors mention that "Evaluation and comparative analyses were conducted for both individual models and the ensemble model via two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS)". This suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Additionally, the authors mention that "AUC values exceeding 0.9 were considered as excellent, 0.9–0.8 as good, 0.8–0.7 as moderate, and < 0.7 as poor" and "TSS values were categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4)". This implies that the authors are evaluating the performance of the models using these metrics.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these are part of the postprocessing steps involved after model training in this specific study.
