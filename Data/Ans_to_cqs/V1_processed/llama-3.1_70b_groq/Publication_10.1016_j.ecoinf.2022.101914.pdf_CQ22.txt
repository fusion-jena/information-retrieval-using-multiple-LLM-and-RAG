The provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model, but it does discuss the evaluation of individual modeling approaches and ensemble models. According to the text, the performance metrics used to evaluate these models are:

1. Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC-ROC)
2. True Skill Statistic (TSS)
3. Sensitivity
4. Specificity

These metrics are used to assess the performance of the models using an external evaluation dataset. The AUC-ROC and TSS are specifically mentioned as being used to evaluate individual modeling approaches and to determine the optimal number of background points for each approach.
