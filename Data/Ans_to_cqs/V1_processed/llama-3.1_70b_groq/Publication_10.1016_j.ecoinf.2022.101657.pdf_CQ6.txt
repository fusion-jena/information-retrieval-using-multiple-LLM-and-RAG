Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general knowledge of deep learning and the context provided, some common preprocessing steps can be inferred.

Typically, before training a deep learning model, the following preprocessing steps are involved:

1. **Data cleaning**: This involves removing any missing or duplicate data, handling outliers, and ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for training.
2. **Data normalization**: This involves scaling the data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
3. **Data scaling**: This involves transforming the data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help improve the stability and speed of training.
4. **Image resizing**: If the model is being trained on image data, the images may need to be resized to a consistent size to fit the model's input requirements.
5. **Data augmentation**: This involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, flipping, or cropping.

It is worth noting that the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the specific model architecture, the type of data being used, and the specific task being performed.

In the context of the provided text, the authors mention the use of image filtering and labeling assistant (ifla) to expedite the analysis of data obtained from camera traps. This suggests that some form of preprocessing may be involved in preparing the data for analysis, but the specific steps are not specified.
