Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimental configurations, hyperparameters, and results of the deep learning models for plant disease classification. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
