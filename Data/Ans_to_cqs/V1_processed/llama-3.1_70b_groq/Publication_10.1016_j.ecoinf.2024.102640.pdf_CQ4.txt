Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the SegFormer model, its encoder-decoder structure, and the components of the MiT encoder and ALL-MLP decoder. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
