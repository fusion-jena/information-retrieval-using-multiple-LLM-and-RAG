I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a machine learning project using Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) to model the growth of herring populations, and discusses hyperparameter tuning, data splitting, and the use of various datasets. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
