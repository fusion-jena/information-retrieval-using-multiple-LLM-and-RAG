The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, such as normalization or scaling. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to extend the amount of data and act as a regularizer to reduce overfitting.

According to the context, the data augmentation techniques used include:

1. Horizontal flip
2. Grayscale (applied to 25% of images)
3. Blur (up to 10px)
4. Noise (up to 10% of pixels)
5. Cropping (a patch with the same size as the original image was randomly cropped from the image)

These techniques were applied randomly to each image before input into the model. However, it is not clear if any other preprocessing steps, such as normalization or scaling, were involved.
