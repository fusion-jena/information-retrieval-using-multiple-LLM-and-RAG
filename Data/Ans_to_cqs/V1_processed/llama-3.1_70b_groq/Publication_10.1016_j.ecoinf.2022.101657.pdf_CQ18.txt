Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the need for further research to train the neural network for bespoke sets of species, benchmarking setup, and the potential for low-power neural networks in hardware. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
