I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The references listed appear to be academic papers and theses related to remote sensing, machine learning, and biomass estimation, but none of them provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
