The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the model was selected relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set, indicating that a validation set was used. Additionally, it mentions that the pre-trained model underwent inference and fine-tuning for 4 iterations using the entire SW stratum employing the SAL, suggesting that the data may have been split into different sets for training and fine-tuning. However, the specific criteria used to split the data (e.g., train, test, validation) are not provided.
