According to the provided context, the data was split into three sets: training set, validation set, and test set. The criteria used to split the data were as follows:

* The validation set was created by taking a random sample of 10% from the total number of tiles.
* A further sample of 10% was taken as the test set.
* The remaining 80% of the tiles were used as the training set.

Additionally, to prevent spatial autocorrelation between neighboring tiles, the tiles retrieved from all 50 training photographs were collected in one folder, shuffled, and then split into the three sets.

It's worth noting that the context also mentions that data augmentation was performed on the training set to artificially increase the number of training samples by applying slight transformations on the original data. However, this is not a criterion for splitting the data, but rather a technique used to increase the size of the training set.
