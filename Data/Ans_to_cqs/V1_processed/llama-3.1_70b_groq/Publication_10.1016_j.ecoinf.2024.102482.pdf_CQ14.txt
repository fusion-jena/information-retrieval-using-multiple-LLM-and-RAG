The hyperparameters of the model were optimized through various experiments to achieve optimal performance. However, the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, is not mentioned in the provided context. It is only mentioned that the number of stacked LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model hyperparameters were selected through experiments.
