The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely audio, as the context mentions "audio signal processing", "audio recording system performance", and "acoustic indices". Additionally, the context mentions specific audio recording devices such as SongMeter and AudioMoth, which further supports the inference that audio data is being used. However, the specific format of the audio data (e.g., WAV, MP3, etc.) is not mentioned.
