The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, except for accuracy. The accuracy of the models is reported in various tables, including Table 5, which shows the accuracy of the models when swapping the testing sets between raw and pre-processed images. 

However, it can be inferred that the accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the models, as it is the only metric reported in the provided context. There is no mention of precision, recall, F1-score, or any other metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.
