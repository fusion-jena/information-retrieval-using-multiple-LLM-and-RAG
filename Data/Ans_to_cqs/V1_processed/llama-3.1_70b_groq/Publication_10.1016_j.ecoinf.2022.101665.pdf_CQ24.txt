Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on spatial sampling methods for map evaluation and thematic map production, discussing different sampling techniques such as simple random sampling, systematic random sampling, and clustered sampling.

The context does mention random processes, such as randomly dividing a dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and randomly shifting an initial square sampling grid to achieve a desired sample size. However, it does not discuss random seed values or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
