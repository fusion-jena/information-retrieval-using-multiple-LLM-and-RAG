The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that the validation accuracy was assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI. This suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved.

The context also does not mention the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps. Since the model is a regression model (predicting a continuous value, TSI), a confusion matrix may not be applicable. 

Therefore, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed from the provided context is metrics calculation, specifically the calculation of R2 and RMSE.
