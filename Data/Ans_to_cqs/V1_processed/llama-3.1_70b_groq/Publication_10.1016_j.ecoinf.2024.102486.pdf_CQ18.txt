Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses the use of GPUs for computation, machine learning applications, and particle filter algorithms, but it does not provide information on how model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
