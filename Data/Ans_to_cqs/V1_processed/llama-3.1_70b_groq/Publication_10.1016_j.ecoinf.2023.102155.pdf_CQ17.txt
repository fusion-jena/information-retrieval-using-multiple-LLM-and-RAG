The provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention several regularization techniques used in regression analysis, including:

* Lasso regression (Tibshirani, 1996)
* Ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970)
* Elastic net regression (Friedman et al., 2010)

These regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting in regression models by imposing a penalty on the parameter coefficients, which helps to reduce the model's complexity and improve its generalization performance.

It is worth noting that while the context does not mention dropout or L2 regularization specifically, these methods are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. However, the context provided does not provide information on the use of these methods in deep learning.
