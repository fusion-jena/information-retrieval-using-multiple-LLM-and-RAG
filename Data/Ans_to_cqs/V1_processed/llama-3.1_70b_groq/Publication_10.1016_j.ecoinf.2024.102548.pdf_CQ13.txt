Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the batch size (32), number of epochs (10), and class mode ('categorical'), but does not provide information on other hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
