Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of satellite image data, specifically MODIS products and Landsat data, for estimating Leaf Area Index (LAI) and other ecological parameters. It also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines and deep neural networks, but does not provide information on the data formats used in the pipeline.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is likely to be image data, specifically satellite imagery. The context mentions the use of Landsat 8 OLI images and MODIS products, which are both types of satellite image data. But the exact format of these images (e.g., TIFF, GeoTIFF, etc.) is not specified.
