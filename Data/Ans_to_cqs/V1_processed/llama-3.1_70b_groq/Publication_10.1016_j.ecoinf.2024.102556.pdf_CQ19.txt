Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses various architectures and techniques, such as Res2Net, Deep SORT, and YOLOv7, but it does not provide information about the underlying frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
