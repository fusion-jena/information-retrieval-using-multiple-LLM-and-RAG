I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, such as random forest and Maxent, for predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease based on environmental factors in South Korea. The context mentions that the dataset consists of environmental variables and land-use types, which were extracted from digital maps using a geographic information system (GIS) program. However, it does not provide information on the specific data formats used in the pipeline.
