Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the data splitting process, model selection, and performance evaluation using various statistical measures. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention the calculation of various performance metrics such as R2, NSE, MEF, Z, Taylor statistics, RMSE, and MAE, which are used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, it mentions the use of Fig. 9 to present the RMSE and MAE for the eight ML algorithms, but it does not provide further details on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
