The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN) to address the issue of domain shift between the source and target datasets. This technique is used to reduce the divergence between the source and target datasets, which can be a result of data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of focal loss for calibrating deep neural networks, which can help to address class imbalance issues in the data. However, it does not provide information on other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a dataset classification error to measure the divergence between the source and target datasets, which can be used to identify data bias. However, it does not provide information on how to address this bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique mentioned that can be used to address data bias is domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN). However, it is likely that other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling may also be used to address data bias, but this is not mentioned in the provided context.
