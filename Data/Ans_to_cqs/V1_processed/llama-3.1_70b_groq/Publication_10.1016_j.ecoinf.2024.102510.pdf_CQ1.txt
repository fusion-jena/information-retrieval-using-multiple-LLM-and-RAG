Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the performance comparison of different deep learning models, specifically in the context of image-based species classification of birds. It discusses the challenges of working with bird image data, such as the need for large amounts of labeled data and the impact of environmental factors on image quality.

However, it does mention the use of a dataset to train the deep learning models, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected. It also references several research papers and articles, but these are not directly related to data collection methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
