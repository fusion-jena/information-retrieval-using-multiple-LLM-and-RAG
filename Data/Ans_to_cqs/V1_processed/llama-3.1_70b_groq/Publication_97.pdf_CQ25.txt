The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is semantic segmentation. According to the provided text, the problem of forest damage identification is a semantic segmentation problem, which is a pixel-wise classification problem aimed at determining the class of the particular pixel of the image it belongs to. The model is designed to handle this problem using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically an encoder-decoder architecture such as U-Net.
