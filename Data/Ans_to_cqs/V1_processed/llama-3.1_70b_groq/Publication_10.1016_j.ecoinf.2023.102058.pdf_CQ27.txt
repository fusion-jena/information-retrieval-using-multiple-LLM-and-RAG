Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts related to the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for water quality parameter prediction. It does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
