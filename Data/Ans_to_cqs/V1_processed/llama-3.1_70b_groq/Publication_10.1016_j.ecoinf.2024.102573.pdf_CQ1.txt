Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. The context primarily focuses on the processing and analysis of audio data, particularly bird vocalizations, using deep learning techniques. It discusses the use of learnable frontends, time-frequency representations, and waveform inputs to neural networks, but does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
