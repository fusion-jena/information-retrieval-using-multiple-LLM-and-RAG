The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in this context is classification. The model is being used to identify which birds are providing care to the chicks and how often they do it. The classification problem involves identifying the type of bird and its behavior, such as feeding the chicks or engaging in nest maintenance activities. The model is trained on a large dataset of images of birds, and its goal is to provide a generalized identification solution that can work effectively across different contexts and recording conditions.
