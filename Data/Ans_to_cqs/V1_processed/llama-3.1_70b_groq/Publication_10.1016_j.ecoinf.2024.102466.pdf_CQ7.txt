Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide some information about the dataset and the training and validation data.

According to Table 3, the dataset consists of 9717 images, with 7773 images used for training and 1943 images used for validation. The context does not mention a separate test set.

It can be inferred that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the specific criteria used for this split are not mentioned. It is common practice in deep learning to split the data into training, validation, and test sets, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the exact criteria used in this case.
