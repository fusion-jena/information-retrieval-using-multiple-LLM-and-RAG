The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of FIREMAP is supervised ML classification. The model is used to procure a Burned Area (BA) vector of the region of interest defined by the user. The classification model is trained on a large predefined training dataset using atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2A scenes. The goal of the model is to classify the region of interest into burned and non-burned areas, thereby providing a categorized BA map.
