The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Sentinel-2 satellite photos and the retrieval of picture data for forest fire point information through the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python. This suggests that remote sensing data from satellite imagery is one possible source of raw data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a dataset with comprehensive aboveground biomass data, which is stored on Google Drive in CSV format. This dataset is likely a public dataset or a dataset collected through other means, but the exact method of collection is not specified.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that remote sensing data from satellite imagery and public datasets are utilized for collecting raw data, but the exact methods used for collecting these datasets are not specified.
