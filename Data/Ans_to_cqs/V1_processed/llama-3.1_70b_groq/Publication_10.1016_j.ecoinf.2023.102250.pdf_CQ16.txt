Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the classification model, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-1 accuracy, and Top-5 accuracy. It also discusses the structure of the generator and the use of different techniques, such as Batch Normalization (BN) and Channel Attention (CBAM), in the DR-ACGAN model.

However, it does mention that the goal of the training process is to achieve an optimal state for both the discriminator and the generator, and that the adversarial training mechanism can lead to unstable training. This suggests that the training process may be monitored and adjusted based on the performance of the model, but the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
