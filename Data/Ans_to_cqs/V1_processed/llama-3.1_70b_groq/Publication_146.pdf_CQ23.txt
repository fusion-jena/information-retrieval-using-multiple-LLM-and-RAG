The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was tested under "very difficult circumstances and complex backgrounds" and still yielded good detection capabilities, which suggests that the model was evaluated on a diverse set of data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a relatively small dataset, but the authors were able to achieve good results, which is consistent with the findings of [19] that modern neural networks can generalize well on small datasets.

It is also worth noting that the model was evaluated using a validation set of 321 image tiles, which suggests that some form of data splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance. However, the exact method of data splitting is not specified.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability, it suggests that the model was evaluated on a diverse set of data and was able to achieve good results despite being trained on a relatively small dataset.
