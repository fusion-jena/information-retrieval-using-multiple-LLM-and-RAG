I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and references related to ecology, climate modeling, and data analysis, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the deep learning model mentioned in the paper "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022).
