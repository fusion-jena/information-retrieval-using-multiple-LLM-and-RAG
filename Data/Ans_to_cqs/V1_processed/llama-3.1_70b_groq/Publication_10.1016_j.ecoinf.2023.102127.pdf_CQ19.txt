I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It appears to be discussing species distribution modeling (SDM) and mentions various R packages such as glmnet, BoomSpikeSlab, dbarts, mboost, and xgboost, but does not mention any deep learning frameworks.
