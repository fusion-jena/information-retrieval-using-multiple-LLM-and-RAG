The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the context of retrieval tasks are:

1. Average Retrieval Precision (ARP)
2. Average Retrieval Rate (ARR)
3. F-score
4. Mean Average Precision (mAP)

These metrics are used to compare the retrieval performances of the deep learning models. 

However, in the context of classification tasks, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Accuracy (Acc)
2. Specificity (Spec)
3. Sensitivity (Sen)

These metrics are defined as follows:

- Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
- Specificity = TN / (FP + TN)
- Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)

Where TP, TN, FP, and FN represent true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.
