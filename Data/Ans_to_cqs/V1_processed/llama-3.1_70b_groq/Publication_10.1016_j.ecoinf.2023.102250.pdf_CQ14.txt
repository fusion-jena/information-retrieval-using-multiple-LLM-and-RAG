Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses various aspects of the model, including the use of spectral normalization, LeakyReLU activation, and dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
