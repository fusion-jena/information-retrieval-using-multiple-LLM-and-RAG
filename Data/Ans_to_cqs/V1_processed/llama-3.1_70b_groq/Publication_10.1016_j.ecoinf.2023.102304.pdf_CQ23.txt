Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily discusses the optimization of model parameters, feature importance, and the use of specific algorithms like XGBoost and Random Forest. It also references various studies and papers related to remote sensing and environmental analysis, but does not provide information on the generalizability of the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
