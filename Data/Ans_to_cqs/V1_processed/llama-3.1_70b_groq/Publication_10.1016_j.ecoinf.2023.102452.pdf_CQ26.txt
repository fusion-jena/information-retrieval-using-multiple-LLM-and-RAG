Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on various topics such as streamflow forecasting, data-driven modeling, and feature selection, but it does not explicitly discuss techniques for addressing data bias.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are indeed techniques used to address data bias and imbalance in machine learning pipelines.

* Stratified splitting is a technique used to split data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set.
* Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the data.
* Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the data.
* Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the data is representative of the problem being addressed.

These techniques are commonly used in machine learning pipelines to address data bias and imbalance, but I couldn't find any specific information on their application in the provided context.
