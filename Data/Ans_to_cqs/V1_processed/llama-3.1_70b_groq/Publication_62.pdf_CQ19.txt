The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, it does mention the use of Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3) to define and train the CNNs. This suggests that the Wolfram Mathematica framework is used to build the deep learning models, but it does not rule out the possibility of using other frameworks. There is no mention of TensorFlow or PyTorch in the provided context.
