Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the evaluation and comparison of different tracking models, specifically the SORT and Deep SORT models, and the introduction of a new feature-extraction network (FEN) to improve tracking performance. It does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
