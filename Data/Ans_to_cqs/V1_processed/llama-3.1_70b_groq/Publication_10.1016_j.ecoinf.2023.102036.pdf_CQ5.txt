Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning in ecology, particularly in image classification and identification of animal species, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
