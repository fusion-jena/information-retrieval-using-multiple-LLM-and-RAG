Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context provides information about the model design, the dataset, and the challenges of domain shift, but it does not discuss hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
