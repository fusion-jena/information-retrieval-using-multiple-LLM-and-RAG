Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the pipeline of the SPG framework, point cloud partition, superpoint embedding, and segmentation. It also discusses model training, result output, and references some research papers related to deep learning and point cloud processing.

However, it does mention "point cloud oversegmentation with graph-structured deep metric learning" in one of the referenced papers by Landrieu and Boussaha (2019). This might imply that the authors are aware of the importance of addressing data bias, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
