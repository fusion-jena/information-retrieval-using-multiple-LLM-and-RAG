The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was tested and validated for various activation functions as well as different testing and training data sets. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or splitting of the data into training and testing sets was performed.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was developed using "multiyear multilocation data", which implies that the dataset used to train and test the model was diverse and collected from multiple locations and years. This could help to improve the generalizability of the model.

However, there is no mention of stratified splitting or other techniques to ensure that the model is generalizable to different scenarios. Therefore, while some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, the exact details are not provided in the context.
