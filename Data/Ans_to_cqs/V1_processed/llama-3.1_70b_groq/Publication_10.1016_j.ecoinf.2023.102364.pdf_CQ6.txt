Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research article or study that uses machine learning ensemble predictions to model the ecological niche of Short-billed Gulls. The context mentions various data sources, geographic information systems, and socio-economic variables, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps that are typically involved before training a deep learning model. These may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help improve the stability and speed of training.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as imputing missing values or removing outliers.
* Feature engineering: selecting and transforming relevant features to improve model performance.
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data.

Please note that these are general preprocessing steps, and the specific steps required may vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture.
