The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model is designed to handle diverse datasets and address issues such as class imbalance and sampling bias.

It specifically highlights the limitations of a loss function (L full) in addressing class imbalance, but it does not provide information on the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.
