Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to focus on the architecture and components of the model, including spectral normalization, activation functions, output sizes, and dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition. It also discusses the use of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) model for generating birdsong spectrograms and the calculation of metrics such as Inception Score (IS) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID).

However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved in this case.
