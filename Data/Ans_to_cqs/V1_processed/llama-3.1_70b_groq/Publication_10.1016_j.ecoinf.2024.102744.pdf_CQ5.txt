The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, except for the ImageNet dataset. According to the text, the authors in [29] proposed four different models for bee image classification, which were based on different Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that have been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Additionally, the VnPollenBee dataset is mentioned as the dataset used for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods. However, it is not clear if this dataset is used for training the models or only for testing. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets in the provided context.
