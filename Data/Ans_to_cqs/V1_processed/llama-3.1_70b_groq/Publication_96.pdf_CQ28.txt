The Google Cloud platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. Specifically, the analysis was conducted using the Google Cloud suite of cloud platform, and the access to GPUs in a virtual machine environment was implemented on this platform. Additionally, the Google Earth Engine platform was used to collect burned and non-burned spectral signatures in Landsat imagery, and the training areas and Landsat imagery were exported to Google Cloud Storage and used as input in a Virtual Machine to process the Deep Learning scripts.
