Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and methodology of the few-shot learning approach, including the use of prototypical networks, transductive learning, and post-processing techniques.

However, it does mention that the training procedure involves optimizing the distances between prototypes and query points in the embedding space, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used to achieve this. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

If more information about the specific deep learning pipeline or implementation is provided, I may be able to offer a more informed answer.
