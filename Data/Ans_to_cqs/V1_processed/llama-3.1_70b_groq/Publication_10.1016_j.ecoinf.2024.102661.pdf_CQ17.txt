Based on the provided context, one of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is L2 regularization. The L2 regularization parameter is adjusted to control overfitting by penalizing large weights. The search range for this parameter is set between 1e-10 and 1e-2, in line with benchmarks from similar studies. This suggests that L2 regularization is used to prevent overfitting in the TPEBO-LSTM model. However, there is no mention of dropout as a regularization method in the provided context.
