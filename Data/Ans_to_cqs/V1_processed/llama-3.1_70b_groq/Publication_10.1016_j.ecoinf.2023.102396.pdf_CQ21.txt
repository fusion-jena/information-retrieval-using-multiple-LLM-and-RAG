Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about model training, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. The context appears to be discussing Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique used for time series alignment and comparison. It explains the calculation of the distance between two time series, the use of dynamic programming to find the least cost path, and the concept of the Sakoe-Chiba band.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
