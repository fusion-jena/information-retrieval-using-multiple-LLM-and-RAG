I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models and environmental variables. The study mentions the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but does not discuss data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
