The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. This suggests that the training process may have been stopped when the mean squared error reached a minimum or a satisfactory level, but the exact stopping criteria are not specified.
