Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and conservation biology, with references to papers on topics such as predicting rare species distribution, modeling impacts of climate change, and biodiversity conservation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, as it is outside the scope of the provided context.
