Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context appears to be related to a research article or study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data and machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest. It discusses the dataset, spectral indices, and sampling strategies, but does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, as this information is not provided in the given context.
