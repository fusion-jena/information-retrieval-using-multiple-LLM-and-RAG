Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing steps, model selection (ERNIE model), and topic modeling using pyLDAvis Library. It also mentions the calculation of perplexity (P(D)) and topic intensity (Sk), but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved in this study.
