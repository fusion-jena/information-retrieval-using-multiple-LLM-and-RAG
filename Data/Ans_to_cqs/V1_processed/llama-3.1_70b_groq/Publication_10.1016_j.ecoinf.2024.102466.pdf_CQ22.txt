The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the provided context are Average Precision (AP) and mean Average Precision (mAP). Specifically, the metrics used are APs, APm, and APl, which correspond to average precision for small, medium, and large size target objects, respectively. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models on object detection tasks, particularly on the proposed dataset.
