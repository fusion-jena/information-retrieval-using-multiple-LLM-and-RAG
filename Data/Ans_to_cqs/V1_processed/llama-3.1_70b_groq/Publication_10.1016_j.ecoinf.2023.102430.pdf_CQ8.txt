I don't know. The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. It mentions that the assessment was implemented in MATLAB and that the 'classical' machine-learning algorithms were run in Python using the scikit-learn toolbox, but it does not provide information about the code repository.
