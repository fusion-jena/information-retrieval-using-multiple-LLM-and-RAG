The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the issue of data distribution shifts and the need for domain adaptation and generalization in the context of weed recognition models.

One relevant paper mentioned in the context is "Unsupervised domain adaptation of object detectors: A survey" by Oza et al. (2023), which suggests that domain adaptation techniques can be used to address data bias and distribution shifts. However, the specific techniques mentioned in the query (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection) are not mentioned in the context.

Another relevant paper is "Domain randomization for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world" by Rai et al. (2017), which mentions domain randomization as a technique for addressing data bias and distribution shifts. However, this paper does not specifically mention the techniques mentioned in the query.

Overall, while the context suggests that data bias and distribution shifts are important issues in the context of weed recognition models, it does not provide specific information on the techniques used to address these issues during preprocessing. Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
