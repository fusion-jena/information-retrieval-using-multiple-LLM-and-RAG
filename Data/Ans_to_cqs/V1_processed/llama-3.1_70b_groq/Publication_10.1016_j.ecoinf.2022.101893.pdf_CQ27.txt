Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly discusses the design of the network, feature selection, and result analysis, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

However, it does mention the hardware platform used for the experiment, which includes a desktop computer with specific specifications, and the software platforms used, such as Anaconda3, PyCharm, Python, TensorFlow, and MATLAB. But it does not provide details on how the trained model was deployed or serialized.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
