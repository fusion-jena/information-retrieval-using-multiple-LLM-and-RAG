Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of encoded characters and symbols, possibly from a technical document or academic paper, but it does not provide any meaningful information about deep learning or randomness.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. However, I can suggest some general strategies that are commonly employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques such as data augmentation to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset
* Employing regularization techniques, such as dropout or L1/L2 regularization, to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization
* Using ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data

However, without more specific information about the context and the requirements of the deep learning pipeline, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
