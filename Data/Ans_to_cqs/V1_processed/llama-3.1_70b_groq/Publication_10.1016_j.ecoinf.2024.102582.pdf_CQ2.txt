The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is remote sensing image data, specifically satellite imagery from Landsat. The context mentions the use of atmospherically corrected United States Geological Survey Landsat Surface reflectance products, which suggests that the data format is likely to be a type of raster image data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Google Earth Pro and the GEE application programming interface (API) for further analysis, which also supports the use of image data. However, it does not provide information on the specific file format (e.g., GeoTIFF, JPEG) used.
