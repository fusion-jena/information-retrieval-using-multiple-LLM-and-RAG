Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions that some model parameters were modified from the default configuration to balance resource usage and training speed, but it does not specify which parameters were changed or to what values. It also mentions that other parameters were kept to default or set according to guidance by the developers, but it does not provide further details. Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
