Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the architecture and training of a deep learning model for species distribution modeling (SDMs), but it does not provide information on the data annotation process.

The context mentions that the model is trained on diverse datasets, including presence-absence and presence-only datasets, but it does not elaborate on how the data was annotated or prepared for training. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
