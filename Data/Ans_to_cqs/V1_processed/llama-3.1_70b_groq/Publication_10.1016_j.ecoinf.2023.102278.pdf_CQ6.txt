According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data augmentation techniques. These techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training data and mitigate overfitting. The specific data augmentation techniques mentioned in the context are:

* Image scaling
* Horizontal and vertical flip
* Perspective distortion
* Adding color jitter for brightness, contrast, and saturation

These techniques are applied to the input images during the training process. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether any other preprocessing steps such as normalization or cleaning are performed. Therefore, I can only confirm the use of data augmentation techniques as a preprocessing step.
