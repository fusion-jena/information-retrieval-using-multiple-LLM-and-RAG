The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the models mentioned in the context are:

* VGG16: a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet
* ResNet152-V2: a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet
* VGGish: a variant of VGG11A, a CNN pre-trained on AudioSet
* YAMNet: a MobileNet-V1 network, a type of CNN pre-trained on AudioSet
* BirdNet: a CNN trained on data from the target modality (audio) and a related domain (bird vocalisations from focal recordings)

There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
