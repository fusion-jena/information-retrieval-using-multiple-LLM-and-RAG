I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It discusses the framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction, the evaluation metrics used, and the results of the model's performance, but it does not specify the architecture of the deep learning model itself. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the model is a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or another type of model.
