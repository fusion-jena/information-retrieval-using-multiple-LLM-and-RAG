The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the one used in BirdNET, is classification. According to the context, BirdNET facilitates the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations through a developed deep neural network, from sound recordings. This means that the model is designed to identify and classify different bird species based on their vocalizations. The model is able to identify over 3000 bird species, but its performance may be limited for detecting and correctly identifying rare species.
