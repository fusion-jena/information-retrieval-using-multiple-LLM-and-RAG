To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the sites used for the study were selected to be as different as possible, encompassing a range of tree canopy conditions. This diverse dataset helped the model to learn flexible deep features that can be applied to different geographic locations.

Secondly, three types of experiments were performed to assess generalization among sites. These experiments used different combinations of hand-annotations and pretraining data. The experiments included: (1) within-site predictions, where the model was trained and tested on data from the same site; (2) cross-site predictions, where the model was trained on data from one site and tested on data from a different site; and (3) transfer learning, where the model was trained on pretraining data from all other sites and hand-annotations from the same site as the evaluation data.

These experiments helped to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data and to evaluate its performance in different geographic locations. The results showed that the model was able to achieve a high accuracy of 80% across all sites, indicating its ability to generalize well.

Overall, the use of a diverse dataset, cross-site predictions, and transfer learning helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
