The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, a variant of CNN called U-Net is mentioned in the context, which is used for semantic segmentation tasks. U-Net is a type of CNN that is particularly well-suited for image segmentation tasks, and it has been used in various applications such as identifying eucalyptus trees in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, counting corn plants, and grading maize drought.
