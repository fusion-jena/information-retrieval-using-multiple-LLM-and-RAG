The provided context does not mention the deployment platform of the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was trained and tested on a PC with Windows 10 operating system, a GPU card (RTX2070), and 16GB memory using the TensorFlow framework. Therefore, I do not know which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
