Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be related to soil nutrient concentration analysis, spectral reflectance, and partial least squares regression (PLSR), but it does not discuss deep learning or randomness in the pipeline.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as random weight initialization, dropout, and data augmentation. To handle randomness, researchers often employ techniques such as:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like batch normalization to reduce the effect of randomness in weight initialization.
3. Employing regularization techniques, such as dropout, to prevent overfitting and reduce the impact of randomness.
4. Using ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different random subsets of the data.

These techniques can help mitigate the effects of randomness in deep learning pipelines, but the specific strategies employed can vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.

In the context of the provided references, I did not find any specific information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. If you have any further questions or would like more information on this topic, please let me know.
