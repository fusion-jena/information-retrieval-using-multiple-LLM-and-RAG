Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily discusses the performance of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), on image classification tasks, particularly in the context of marine animal recognition. It also mentions the use of different loss functions, such as contrastive loss, but does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
