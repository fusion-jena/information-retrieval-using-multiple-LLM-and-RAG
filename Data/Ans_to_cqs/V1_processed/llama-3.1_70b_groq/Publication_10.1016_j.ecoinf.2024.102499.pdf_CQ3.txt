The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. According to the text, "we annotated sharks and the 19 non-shark species present in the frames with bounding boxes." This resulted in 26,947 fish annotations, as shown in Table 1. The use of bounding box annotation is also mentioned in the context of the Faster RCNN architecture, which "automatically generates negative samples", eliminating the need to annotate negative samples. There is no mention of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques being used in the pipeline.
