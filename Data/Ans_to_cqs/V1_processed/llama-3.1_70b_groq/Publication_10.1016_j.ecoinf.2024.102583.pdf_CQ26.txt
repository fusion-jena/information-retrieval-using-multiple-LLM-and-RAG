The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that heterogeneous ensemble techniques can address biases and improve the effectiveness of models. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of the ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). 

It does not provide information on specific techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
