The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Tree of Parzen Estimators Bayesian Optimization (TPEBO) algorithm. This algorithm is a strategic approach to hyperparameter optimization that begins with an exploratory phase of random searches for feasible hyperparameter configurations. It then progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global optimum with increasing precision.

The TPEBO algorithm uses a probabilistic model to guide the identification and selection of optimal hyperparameter combinations. This model incorporates a probabilistic approach to continuously refine the optimization based on objective function assessments, thereby facilitating an effective search for hyperparameter sets that minimize the objective function most effectively.

The algorithm is further designed to mitigate the risks of local optima and to explore new potential minimization areas through the Expected Improvement (EI) function, promoting a balance between exploration and exploitation in the optimization journey.

In contrast to grid search or random search, the TPEBO algorithm is a more efficient and effective approach to hyperparameter optimization, particularly for complex models like LSTM neural networks. It automates the hyperparameter adjustment process, significantly reducing the time spent on manual tuning and making the modeling workflow more efficient.
