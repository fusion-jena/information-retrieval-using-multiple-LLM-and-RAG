Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context discusses the methodology used for modeling, including generating pseudo-absence points, splitting data into training and testing datasets, and evaluating model performance using AUC and TSS. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
