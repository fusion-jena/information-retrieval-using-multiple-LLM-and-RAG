The provided context does not specifically mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. In fact, the context does not mention deep learning at all, but rather supervised learning and the use of a Random Forest classifier.

However, it does mention the use of random points in the sampling process, where 400 random points were generated within a subplot, and subsequently assigned to one of the two land cover classes. The context also mentions that the Random Forest classifier uses a randomly selected subset of training data and independent variables to produce multiple decision trees.

It can be inferred that randomness is introduced in the sampling process and in the Random Forest classifier, but there is no mention of strategies to handle this randomness, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
