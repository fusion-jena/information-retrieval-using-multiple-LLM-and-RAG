The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the WT-HMM. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained and tested on different dataset sizes, which may have helped to evaluate its performance on varying amounts of data.

The context mentions that the experiments were performed over 10 runs, which suggests that some form of cross-validation or repeated testing was used to capture the variability introduced by random factors, such as random initialization of weights. However, it does not provide details on the specific cross-validation technique used or whether stratified splitting was employed.

Regarding the diversity of the dataset, the context mentions that larger datasets provide models with more diverse examples, aiding in the generalization of learned features and patterns. This suggests that the dataset used may have been diverse, but no further information is provided on the specific measures taken to ensure diversity.

In summary, while the context provides some hints on the measures taken to ensure generalizability, it does not provide a clear answer to the query. Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer based on the available information.
