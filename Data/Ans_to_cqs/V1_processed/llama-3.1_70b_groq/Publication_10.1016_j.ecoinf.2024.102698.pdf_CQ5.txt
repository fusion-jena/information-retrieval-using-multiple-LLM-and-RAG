Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the use of synthetic data generation methods, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), for ecological and environmental applications. It mentions the use of a GAN model to generate synthetic connectivity data, but does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further questions or context, I would be happy to try and assist you.
