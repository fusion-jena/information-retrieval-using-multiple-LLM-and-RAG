The provided context does not specifically discuss the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset was divided into a "training dataset" and a "testing dataset" for the purpose of SPAD value modeling.

According to the context, the dataset was split as follows:

* The dataset contained 89 valid records.
* One record represented the mean value of the total 10 spot measurements on one leaf.
* The dataset was divided into a "training dataset" containing 60 randomly selected records.
* The remaining 29 records were used as the "testing dataset".

There is no mention of a validation dataset or the specific criteria used to split the data. It appears that the data was split randomly, with 60 records used for training and 29 records used for testing.
