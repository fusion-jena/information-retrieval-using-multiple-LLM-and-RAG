Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of high-resolution satellite photos, machine learning techniques, and cloud computing capabilities for land use and land cover (LULC) data analysis, fire damage assessment, and carbon emissions quantification. It does not delve into the details of data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The mentioned techniques (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection) are common methods used to address data bias, but I cannot confirm if they are used in this particular context.
