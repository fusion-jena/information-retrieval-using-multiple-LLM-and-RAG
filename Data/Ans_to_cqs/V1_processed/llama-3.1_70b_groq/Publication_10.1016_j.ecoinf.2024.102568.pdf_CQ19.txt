Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only discusses the architecture and configuration of the LSTM model, the loss function, optimization algorithm, and other details, but does not mention the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
