Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text discusses the use of machine learning models, including Lasso, Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, and the application of the signature method for data transformation. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
