The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the text mentions several datasets used for training and testing the models, including:

* RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard
* RGB-images of a single tree branch
* RGB-images of urban streets
* Synthetic images and natural images of forests
* RGB-images of a modern apple orchard
* RGB-images of complex urban scenes

These datasets are used for tasks such as saliency detection (SOD), object detection (OD), and segmentation (Seg). The specific datasets used are not well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather custom datasets collected for specific applications.
