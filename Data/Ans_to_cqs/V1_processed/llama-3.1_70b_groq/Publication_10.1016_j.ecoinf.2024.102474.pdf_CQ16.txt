The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation ENS (EarthNetScore) repeatedly failing to improve compared to the score evaluated from previous epochs. In other words, training is stopped when the validation score plateaus and no longer improves. This is mentioned in the context as: "The optimization was stopped once the validation ENS repeatedly failed to improve compared to the score evaluated from previous epochs."
