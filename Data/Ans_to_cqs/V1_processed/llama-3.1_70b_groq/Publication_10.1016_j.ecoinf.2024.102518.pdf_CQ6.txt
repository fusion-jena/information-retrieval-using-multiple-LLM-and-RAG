Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and ecological niche models, and it discusses the use of metrics such as AUC-ROC and CBI to evaluate model performance. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps used before training a deep learning model.

That being said, the context does mention the use of a regularization multiplier and the selection of a feature class ('LQP') as part of the model tuning process. This suggests that some form of feature selection and regularization may have been used, but the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any further context or information, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
