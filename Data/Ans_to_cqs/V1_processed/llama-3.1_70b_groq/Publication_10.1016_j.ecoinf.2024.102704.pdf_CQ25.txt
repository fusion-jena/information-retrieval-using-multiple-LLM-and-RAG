The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, specifically fish detection. The study mentions establishing detection thresholds of IoU = 0.3 and score = 0.3, indicating that a bounding box with a likelihood of containing a fish of 30% or higher was considered valid and thus retained. This suggests that the model is designed to detect fish in images or videos.
