I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text discusses the use of machine learning methods for classification, including "human in the loop" classification and the potential use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for classification. However, it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
