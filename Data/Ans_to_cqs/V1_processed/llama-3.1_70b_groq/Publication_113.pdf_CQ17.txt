Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses active learning strategies, dimensionality reduction using deep neural networks, and the use of specific architectures such as ResNet-50. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used in this context.
