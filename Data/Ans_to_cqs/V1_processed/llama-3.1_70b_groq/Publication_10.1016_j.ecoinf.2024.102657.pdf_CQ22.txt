The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the CNN. However, it does mention that the accuracy levels of the CNN on noise-filtered data versus raw data were similar, with an average accuracy of 99.22% on filtered data and 99.25% on non-filtered data after 10 trials. This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the CNN. 

Additionally, the context provides a table with test results, which includes columns for "Match, Both Correct", "Match, Both Incorrect", "Mismatch, CNN Correct", "Mismatch, k-NN Correct", and "Mismatch, Both Incorrect". This table implies that the performance of the CNN and k-NN models is being evaluated based on their ability to correctly classify songs, but it does not provide information on precision or recall. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only metric that can be confirmed as being used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy.
