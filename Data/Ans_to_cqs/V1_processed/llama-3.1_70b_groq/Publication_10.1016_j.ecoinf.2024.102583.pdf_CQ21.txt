Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the discussion of various machine learning models and algorithms used for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM), including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, and others.

However, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps would likely involve evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as creating confusion matrices to visualize the model's performance. Additionally, techniques like Saliency maps might be used to interpret the model's predictions and understand the importance of different input features.

But without explicit information, I cannot provide a detailed answer to the query.
