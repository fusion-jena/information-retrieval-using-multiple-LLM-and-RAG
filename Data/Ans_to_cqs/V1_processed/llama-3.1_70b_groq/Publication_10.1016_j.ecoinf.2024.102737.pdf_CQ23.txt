The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the training set included 21 different individuals (classes) each having 4 different 320 Ã— 320 pixels images, and the test size included 99 other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set. This suggests that the dataset is relatively small and may not be highly diverse.

Additionally, the context mentions that the images varied in their poses and other image characteristics, such as contrast and brightness. This could indicate that the dataset has some level of variability, but it is unclear if this is sufficient to ensure generalizability.

There is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. The experiments (E1 and E2) seem to have used a fixed train-test split, with the train set sizes ranging from 24 to 120 images and the test set sizes ranging from 59 to 68 images.

Overall, based on the provided context, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
