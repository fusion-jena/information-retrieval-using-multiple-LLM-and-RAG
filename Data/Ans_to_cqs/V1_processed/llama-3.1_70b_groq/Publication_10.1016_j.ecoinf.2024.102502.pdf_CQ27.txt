Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses data filtering, scaling, and the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for processing large environmental datasets. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
