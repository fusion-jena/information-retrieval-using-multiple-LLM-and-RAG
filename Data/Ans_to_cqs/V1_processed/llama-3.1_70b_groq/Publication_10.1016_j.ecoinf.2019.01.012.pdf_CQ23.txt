To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the tiles retrieved from all 50 training photographs were collected in one folder and shuffled before being split into training, validation, and test sets. This shuffling process helped to prevent spatial autocorrelation between neighboring tiles.

The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets using a random sampling approach. Specifically, 10% of the total number of tiles were randomly selected as the validation set, and another 10% were randomly selected as the test set. The remaining 80% of the tiles were used as the training set.

Data augmentation was also performed on the training set to artificially increase the number of training samples. This involved applying slight transformations to the original data.

Additionally, the model was evaluated on two different data sets: individual tiles and whole repeat photographs. The prediction accuracy on individual tiles was calculated using the 5796 tiles from the test set, which was separated from the total number of samples before training. The accuracy on whole repeat photographs was evaluated based on the image pairs of the second set of photographs, and a confusion matrix was prepared for each photograph individually.

Overall, these measures helped to ensure that the model was trained and evaluated on diverse and representative data, which can improve its generalizability to new, unseen data.
