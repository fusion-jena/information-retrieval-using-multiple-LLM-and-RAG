The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that the model was trained again on all the annotated scans earlier and tested on a different un-annotated dataset, and that the model performed well based on visual inspection. It does not provide information on the specific metrics or criteria used to determine the completion of training.
