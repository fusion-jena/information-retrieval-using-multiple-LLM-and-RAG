The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only discusses the comparison of different deep learning models, such as Inception-ResNet-v2, Inception-v3, Xception, ResNet101, and MobileNetV2, and the use of transfer learning to improve the learning of the target predictive function. Therefore, I do not know which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
