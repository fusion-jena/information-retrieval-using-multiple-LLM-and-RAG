The provided context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), discussing the use of Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands, Google Earth Engine (GEE), and the System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis (SAGA) GIS. It also mentions the analysis of land use and land cover, soil sampling, and the study of heavy metal content in agricultural soil. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
