Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the training and evaluation of different ResNet architectures on validation and test sets, as well as the performance comparison of these models. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
