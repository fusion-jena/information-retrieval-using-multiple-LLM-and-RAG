Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context mainly discusses the validation process, where the model's output is compared to field data, and the results are presented in a cross-comparison. It also mentions the use of the fuzzy logic toolbox in Matlab 2023b to implement the FIS models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
