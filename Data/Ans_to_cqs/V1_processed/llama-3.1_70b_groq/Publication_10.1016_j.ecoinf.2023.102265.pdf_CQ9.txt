I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for feature extraction and provides some details about the model's architecture and performance, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline itself is stored or shared.
