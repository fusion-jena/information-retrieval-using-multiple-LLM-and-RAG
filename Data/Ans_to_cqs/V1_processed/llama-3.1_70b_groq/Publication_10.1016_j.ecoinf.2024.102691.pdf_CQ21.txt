Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training parameters, and attention mechanisms used in the YOLOv5 network. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the model was "analysed using various evaluation matrices" during training, but it does not elaborate on what these evaluation matrices are or how they were used. It also mentions that the model's performance was compared and tested against other methods and fruits using different input modals and fusion techniques, but it does not provide details on the specific postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
