I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the creation of the FishInTurbidWater dataset, the development of two novel deep learning models, and the use of the ImageNet dataset for transfer learning, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.
