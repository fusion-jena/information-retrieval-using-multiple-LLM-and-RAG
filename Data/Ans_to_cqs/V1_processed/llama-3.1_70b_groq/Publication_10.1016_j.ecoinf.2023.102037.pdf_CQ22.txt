The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Precision, Recall, Precision-Recall (PR) curve, Average Precision (AP), and mean Average Precision (mAP). 

Precision measures the fraction of the target insects in the detected objects, while Recall measures the fraction of detected target insects from all the target insects within one image. The Precision-Recall curve is used to evaluate the overall model performance for insect detection. Average Precision (AP) is the area under the PR curve for a given IoU threshold, and mAP is the mean AP for all insect classes in the dataset. 

These metrics are defined as follows:

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
AP = âˆ« P(r)dr from 0 to 1

where TP, TN, FP, and FN stand for true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative, respectively.
