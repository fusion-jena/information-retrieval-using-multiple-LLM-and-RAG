The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSELM) algorithm has no prior knowledge as to how many training observations will be presented, suggesting that it may be able to adapt to the training data as it is presented.

Additionally, the context mentions that OSELM only requires the number of hidden nodes to be specified, implying that the algorithm may not require explicit criteria for determining when training is complete. Instead, it may rely on its sequential learning mechanism to adapt to the training data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
