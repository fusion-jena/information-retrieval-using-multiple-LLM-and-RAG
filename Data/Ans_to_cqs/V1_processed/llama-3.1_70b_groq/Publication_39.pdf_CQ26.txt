The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset is split randomly into a train set, validation set, and test set, with the test set including 20% of the video clips of each class, and the validation set including 20% of the remaining clips in each class. This suggests that stratified splitting is used to ensure that each class is represented in the train, validation, and test sets.

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection techniques being used to address data bias. The context does mention the use of data augmentation techniques, such as horizontal flip, add/subtract intensity, Gaussian blur, and additive Gaussian noise, to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. However, these techniques are not specifically aimed at addressing data bias.
