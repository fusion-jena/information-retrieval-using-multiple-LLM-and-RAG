The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of a validation loss metric. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This suggests that the model's performance on a validation set is being tracked during training, and adjustments are made to the learning rate based on this performance.
