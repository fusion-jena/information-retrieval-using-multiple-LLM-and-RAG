Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution models (SDMs) and covariate selection procedures, specifically discussing algorithms such as generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and random forests. It does not mention deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you could provide more context or clarify the relationship between the query and the provided text, I would be happy to try and assist further.
