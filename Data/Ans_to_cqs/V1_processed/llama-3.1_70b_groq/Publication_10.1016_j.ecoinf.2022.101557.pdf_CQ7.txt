The data is split into several larger blocks depending on coordinates, with the purpose of cross-validating the model. These blocks are then split into many smaller areas of 80 × 80 pixels. A 10-fold cross-validation is performed, where the map is divided into a 3 × 3 grid, and the central cell is split into two cells, resulting in 10 sets in total. During training, 9 of these sets are used for training, and the final one is used for evaluation. Additionally, 20% of the training samples are used as a validation set to prevent overfitting.
