The deep learning models used in the pipeline are primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the models mentioned include:

1. UNet: a CNN architecture originally proposed for biomedical image segmentation, based on an encoder-decoder-type network.
2. VGG16: a CNN architecture used in Model-K, without the feature extractor on top.
3. EfficientNet-B5: a CNN developed by Google, characterized by high accuracy and computational efficiency, used as a feature extractor in Model-2.
4. Count-ception: a CNN-based network that uses Inception modules to build a network for counting objects in an image.

Additionally, the pipeline also uses fully connected (FC) layers and regression models, but the primary deep learning models used are CNNs. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
