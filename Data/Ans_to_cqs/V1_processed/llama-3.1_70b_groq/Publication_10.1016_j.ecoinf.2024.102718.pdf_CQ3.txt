Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, transformer capabilities, and existing models used for rice plant disease detection. It also mentions data acquisition and dataset information, but it does not provide details on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
