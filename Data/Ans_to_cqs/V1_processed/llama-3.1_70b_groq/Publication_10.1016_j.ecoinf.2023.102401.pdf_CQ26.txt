The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques used to expand the dataset and enhance the learning effect and generalization performance of the network.

The data augmentation techniques mentioned include:

* HSV adjustment (modifying the image's hue, saturation, and value components)
* Rotation (randomly rotating the image within a specific range)
* Scaling (changing the size of the image while maintaining its aspect ratio)
* Cropping (randomly cropping a portion of the image)
* Flipping (horizontally flipping the image)
* Mosaicking (combining multiple randomly cropped, resized, and rotated images)

These techniques can help increase the diversity of the dataset and potentially reduce data bias, but they do not specifically address data bias. The context does not mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, which are commonly used to address data bias.
