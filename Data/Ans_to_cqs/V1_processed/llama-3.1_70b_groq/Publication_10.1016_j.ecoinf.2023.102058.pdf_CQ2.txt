The text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely hyperspectral imagery data, as the study involves using machine learning algorithms to predict water quality parameters from hyperspectral data. The text mentions the use of EnMAP simulated data and AISA Eagle airborne hyperspectral images, but it does not specify the exact data format (e.g., image files, CSV files, etc.).
