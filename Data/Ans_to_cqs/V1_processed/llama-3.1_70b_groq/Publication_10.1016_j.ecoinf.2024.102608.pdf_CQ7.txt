The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the algorithms' performance and parameter settings were assessed using a "training and test set approach" (Section 2.5). This suggests that the data was split into at least two sets: a training set and a test set. There is no mention of a validation set. 

It is common in machine learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance. However, without more information, it is unclear if this is the approach used in this specific study.
