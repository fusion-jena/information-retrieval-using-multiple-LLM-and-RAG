I don't know. The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the performance metrics of various deep learning models on two datasets (UBD_45 and VP_200) and mentions the use of Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
