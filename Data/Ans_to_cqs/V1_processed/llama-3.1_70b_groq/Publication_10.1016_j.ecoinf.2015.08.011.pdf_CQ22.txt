The metric used to evaluate the performance of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model in this study is the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data. This is mentioned in the text as "For each configuration, the mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data was calculated." Additionally, the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the optimal learning rate were selected based on the maximum model performance as indicated by MSE, as shown in Figure 2. 

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall being used as evaluation metrics in this study. The focus is on minimizing the MSE to achieve the best model performance.
