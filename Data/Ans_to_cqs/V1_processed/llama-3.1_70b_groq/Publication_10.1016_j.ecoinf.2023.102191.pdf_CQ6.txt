I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or preprocessing steps involved in training such models. The context appears to be related to a study on using a mobile app for marine species monitoring and data collection, and discusses aspects such as data quality, standardization, and user feedback. There is no mention of deep learning or preprocessing steps, so I cannot provide a relevant answer.
