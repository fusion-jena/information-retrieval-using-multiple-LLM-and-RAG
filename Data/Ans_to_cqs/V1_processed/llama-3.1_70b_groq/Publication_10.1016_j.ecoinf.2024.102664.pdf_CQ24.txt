Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly hybrid CNN-LSTM models, for algal bloom forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. It discusses the performance of these models, their comparison, and the importance of satellite data in machine learning. However, it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
