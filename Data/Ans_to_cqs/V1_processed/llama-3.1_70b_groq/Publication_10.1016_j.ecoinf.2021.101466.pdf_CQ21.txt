Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily discusses data augmentation techniques, including random erasing, cropping, flipping, scaling, rotating, adding noise, and color transformation, which are used to preprocess the training dataset. It also mentions the improvement in performance of the EfficientNet model after applying these techniques. However, it does not provide any information about the postprocessing steps that occur after model training.
