Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms, satellite images, and water quality monitoring using various sensors like Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI. It discusses the efficacy of different AC algorithms, the importance of certain spectral bands, and the challenges of aerosol types in retrieving high-quality remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data.

While the context mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
