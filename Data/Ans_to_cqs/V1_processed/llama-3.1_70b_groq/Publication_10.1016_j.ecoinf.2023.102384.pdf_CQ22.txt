The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE). These metrics are used to assess the counting performance of the model. 

MAE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual counts. MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual counts. MARE measures the average absolute relative difference between the predicted and actual counts.

These metrics are defined as follows:

MAE = (1/N) * ∑[|cn_gt - cn_pred|] from n=1 to N
MSE = (1/N) * ∑[(cn_gt - cn_pred)^2] from n=1 to N
MARE = (1/N) * ∑[|cn_pred - cn_gt| / cn_gt] from n=1 to N

where cn_gt is the ground truth count, cn_pred is the predicted count, and N is the total number of samples.

Note that the text does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model.
