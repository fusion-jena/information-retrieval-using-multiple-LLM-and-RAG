Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the methodology and data used for a study on human-affected (HA) and natural environment (NE) coupled zoning, rather than the technical details of the deep learning model implementation.

Therefore, I don't know which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model.
