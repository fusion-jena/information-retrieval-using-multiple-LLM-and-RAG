I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a section of a paper discussing the use of machine learning and clustering techniques to analyze coral reef community data. The references cited are also research papers and do not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
