Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on soil moisture estimation, remote sensing, and ecological informatics, with no direct reference to deep learning or regularization methods.

However, it is mentioned that "it would be worthwhile in this context to test various methods of machine learning or deep neural networks, which would perhaps allow to increase the accuracy of prediction." This suggests that the authors are considering exploring deep learning techniques, but they do not provide specific details on the methods they plan to use.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
