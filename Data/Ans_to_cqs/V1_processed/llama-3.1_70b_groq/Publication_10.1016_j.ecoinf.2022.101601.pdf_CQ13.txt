I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a table comparing different models based on their input parameters, but it does not mention hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context seems to be focused on ecological informatics and permafrost modeling, and it does not provide information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters.
