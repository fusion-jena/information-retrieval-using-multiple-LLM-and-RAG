The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of random selection and cropping of images in the training process.

For example, in section 2.4.1, it is mentioned that 6092 photos were "randomly selected" from the full set, excluding the 20 photos known to contain bears. Additionally, each photo was "cropped at a random location" to match the CNN's input size. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data preparation process, but it does not provide information on how this randomness is controlled or reproduced.

In section 2.4.2, it is mentioned that the training images were "randomly selected and cropped" to serve as background validation images. Again, this introduces randomness in the data preparation process, but it does not provide information on how this randomness is controlled or reproduced.

Overall, while the context mentions the use of randomness in the data preparation process, it does not provide information on strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
