Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The context only mentions that the implementation was done in MATLAB and Python, but it does not provide information about the underlying hardware. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
