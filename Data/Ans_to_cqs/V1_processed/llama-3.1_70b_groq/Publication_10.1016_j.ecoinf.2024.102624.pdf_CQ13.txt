I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the use of three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), along with their respective hyperparameters that were tuned using a grid search method. The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are specific to these algorithms and do not include learning rate or optimizer, which are typically associated with deep learning models.
