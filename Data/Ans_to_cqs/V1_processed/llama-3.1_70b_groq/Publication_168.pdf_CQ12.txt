The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). According to the provided context, CNNs are the most widely explored deep learning methods for solving the Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification task. Specifically, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) was designed for classification based on the spectral feature of HSI. Additionally, other variations of CNN architectures, such as multiscale CNN, 3-D convolutional neural networks, and residual networks, have also been proposed and used for HSI classification. There is also a mention of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks being used in conjunction with CNNs in a unified network, but CNNs appear to be the primary deep learning model used in the pipeline.
