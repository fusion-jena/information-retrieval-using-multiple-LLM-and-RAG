According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy: This is mentioned in the context as the classification accuracy of each model, and it is presented in Table 2 and Table 3.
2. Precision: This is mentioned in Table 1 as one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of YOLOv7, with values ranging from 90.8% to 93.2%.
3. Recall: This is also mentioned in Table 1 as one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of YOLOv7, with values ranging from 89.2% to 92.8%.
4. AP (Average Precision): This is mentioned in Table 1 as one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of YOLOv7, with values ranging from 94.6% to 95.9%.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of different models, including the CA-Hybrid network, ResNet, ViT, and YOLOv7.
