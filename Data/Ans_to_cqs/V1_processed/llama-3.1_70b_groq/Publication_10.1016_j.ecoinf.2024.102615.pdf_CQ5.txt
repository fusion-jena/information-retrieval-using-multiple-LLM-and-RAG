Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning algorithms to predict total phosphorus concentration in rivers and soil Mn content, but it does not provide information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
