The purpose of the machine learning model, specifically the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, is classification. It is used to classify the maturity of Chilean hake fish, specifically to determine whether they are immature, mature-inactive, or reproductively active. The model is trained on data and uses computational methods to "learn" directly from the data, without relying on a carefully defined function as a model. The goal is to accurately predict the reproductive condition of the fish, which is essential for their management and conservation in the ecosystem.
