The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of learning and loss curves. The learning curves provide insight into how the model is learning over time, while the loss curves show the model's performance on the training data when the optimization algorithm adjusts the model parameters to minimize the loss function. Specifically, the training accuracy curve and validation accuracy curve are used to diagnose the learning performance of the model, and the training loss curve and validation loss curve are used to measure the model's performance on the training data and new unseen data, respectively. This allows for the detection of issues such as overfitting, where the model performs well on the training dataset but fails to generalize to the validation dataset.
