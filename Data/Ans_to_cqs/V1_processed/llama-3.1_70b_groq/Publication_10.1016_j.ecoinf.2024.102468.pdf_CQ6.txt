Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text appears to focus on the use of a Wavelet Transform Hidden Markov Model (WT-HMM) for classification, and the discussion is centered around the model's performance and evaluation metrics. There is no mention of deep learning models or the preprocessing steps typically associated with them, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is worth noting that the text does mention the use of feature vectors extracted from test datasets, which are then updated using trained Gaussian parameters to produce refined feature vectors. This suggests that some form of feature processing or transformation is taking place, but the specifics of this process are not elaborated upon.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
