The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a research study on groundwater-climate interactions, and the datasets mentioned are primarily focused on hydrological and climate-related data, such as:

* TWS (Terrestrial Water Storage)
* SMS (Soil Moisture Storage)
* GWS (Groundwater Storage)
* SPEI (Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index)
* ENSO (El-Ni√±o Southern Oscillation)
* NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation)
* AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation)
* PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation)
* IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole)
* NTA (North Tropical Atlantic)
* STA (South Tropical Atlantic)
* ETA (Equatorial Atlantic)

These datasets are listed in Table 1, which provides a summary of the datasets used in the study, along with their spatial and temporal resolution and sources. However, none of the datasets mentioned are related to deep learning pipelines or computer vision tasks.
