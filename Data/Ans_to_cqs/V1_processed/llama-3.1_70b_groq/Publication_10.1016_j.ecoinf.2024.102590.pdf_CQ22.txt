The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the results obtained in this study can be used as a baseline for future LULC analysis performed with other methodologies, such as deep learning CNN.

In the context of the study, the performance of the Random Forest classification is evaluated using accuracy metrics, including:

* Overall accuracy: the percentage of correctly classified pixels in a map
* Producer's accuracy: the correctness of reference pixel classification
* User's accuracy: how accurately the classification represents actual ground conditions

These metrics are calculated using a confusion matrix in GEE. However, it is not clear if these metrics would be used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. 

It is worth noting that the context mentions that deep learning methods will be used in the future to map land cover or more specifically woody cover, but it does not provide information on the specific metrics that will be used to evaluate their performance.
