Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context appears to be discussing the evaluation of a tracking algorithm, including metrics such as FPS (frames per second) and memory usage, as well as the optimization of detection accuracy and inference speed. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
