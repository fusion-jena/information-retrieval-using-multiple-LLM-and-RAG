I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its type (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) in the pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper on data analysis, specifically on vocalisation patterns, and provides information on the authors' contributions, data availability, and acknowledgements. However, it does not provide any details on the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline.
