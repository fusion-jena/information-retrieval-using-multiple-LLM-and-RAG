Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of GPUs in ecological informatics, machine learning applications, and various software tools used for these purposes. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
