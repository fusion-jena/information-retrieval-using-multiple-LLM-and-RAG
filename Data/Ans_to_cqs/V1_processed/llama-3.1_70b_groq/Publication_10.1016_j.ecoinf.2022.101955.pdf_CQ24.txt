Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on a research study that used random forest classification (RF) for land cover classification, and it discusses the use of the "randomForest" package in R, which allows the model to set the number of trees (ntree) and number of features in each split (mtry) by default. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

In fact, the context does not mention deep learning at all, but rather focuses on traditional machine learning techniques such as random forest classification. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
