Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in image analysis and classification tasks. It discusses the advantages and limitations of deep learning, the architecture of CNNs, and their applications in various fields.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline may come from various sources, such as:

* Repeat photography, as mentioned in several references (e.g., Klett, 2010; Molnia, 2010; NÃ¼sser, 2001), which involves collecting photographs of the same location over time to monitor changes.
* Public datasets, as mentioned in the reference (Weiss, 2016), which discusses transfer learning and the use of pre-trained models on large datasets.
* Sensors, although not explicitly mentioned, may be used to collect data in certain applications, such as monitoring fields or environmental changes.

It is essential to note that the context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query, and the methods used for collecting raw data may vary depending on the specific application and task.
