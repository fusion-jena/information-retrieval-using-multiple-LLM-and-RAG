The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used as an alternative performance metric. These metrics are calculated based on the occurrences of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). The formulas for calculating these metrics are:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

These metrics are reported separately for each defined class, and averages over all classes are also reported.
