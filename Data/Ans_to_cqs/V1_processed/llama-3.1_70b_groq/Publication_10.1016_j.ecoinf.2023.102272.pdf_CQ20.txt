Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). The text only discusses the model selection procedure, the architecture of the models, and their performance, but does not provide information on the computational resources used for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
