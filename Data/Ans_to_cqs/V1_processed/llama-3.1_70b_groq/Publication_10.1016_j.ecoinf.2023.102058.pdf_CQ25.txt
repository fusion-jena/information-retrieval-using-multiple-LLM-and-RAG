The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the deep learning model is being used to predict water quality parameters from hyperspectral data. Specifically, one of the references mentions using deep learning to estimate chlorophyll a concentration of inland water bodies. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely regression or prediction, rather than classification, segmentation, or detection.
