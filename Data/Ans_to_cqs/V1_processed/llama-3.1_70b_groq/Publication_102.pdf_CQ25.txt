The purpose of the deep learning model is regression, specifically object counting. The model is designed to predict the number of objects in an image by generating a density map, which is then used to estimate the count. The model is trained on two datasets, one for counting SSLs (Sea Lion Locations) and the other for counting elephants. The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict the count of objects in the test images.
