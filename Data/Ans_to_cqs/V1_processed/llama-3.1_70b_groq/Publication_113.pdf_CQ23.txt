The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning, which can help improve the generalizability of the model. According to the context, "the general features that deep neural networks learn on a large dataset are reused to learn a smaller dataset better and more efficiently." This suggests that the model was pre-trained on a large dataset and then fine-tuned on the target dataset, which can help improve its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of active learning, which involves selecting the most informative samples to be labeled and added to the training set. This can help improve the model's performance on unseen data by reducing the risk of overfitting to the training set.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. It is possible that these measures were taken, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
