Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on the evaluation of different software programs for bird species recognition, the effects of sample size and network depth on deep learning approaches, and the analysis of acoustic data.

However, it does mention the work of Breiman (2001) on Random Forests, which is a machine learning algorithm, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
