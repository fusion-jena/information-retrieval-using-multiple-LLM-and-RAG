The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of fine-tuning and iterative training processes to enhance the model's performance and gather samples pertaining to each key species present in the region.

It also mentions the use of hard negative patches, which are patches containing false positives, to further train the model and reduce the number of false positives. This technique can be seen as a form of undersampling, where the model is trained on a subset of the data that is most relevant to the task at hand.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Stratified sampling approach, where the data is divided into strata and the model is trained on each stratum separately. This approach can help to address data bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data.

However, it does not mention oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context mentions the use of Stratified sampling and hard negative patches, but does not provide information on other techniques used to address data bias.
