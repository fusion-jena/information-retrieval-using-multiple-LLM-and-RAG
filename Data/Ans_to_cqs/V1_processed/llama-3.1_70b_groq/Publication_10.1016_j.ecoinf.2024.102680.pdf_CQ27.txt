Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the UODN (Underwater Object Detection Network) model, specifically the modifications made to the YOLOv8 network to improve its performance on underwater optical images. It discusses the preprocessing steps, feature extraction, and backbone of the model, but does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query regarding the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
