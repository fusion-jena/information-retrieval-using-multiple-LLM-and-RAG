Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the use of GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize the activation map of the final convolutional layer of each model, highlighting regions of importance within the spectrogram to the model's classification prediction (Fig. 7).

This suggests that some form of visualization or saliency mapping is used to interpret the model's predictions, but it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as metrics calculation or confusion matrix analysis.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context only mentions the use of GradCAM for visualization, but does not provide information on other postprocessing steps.
