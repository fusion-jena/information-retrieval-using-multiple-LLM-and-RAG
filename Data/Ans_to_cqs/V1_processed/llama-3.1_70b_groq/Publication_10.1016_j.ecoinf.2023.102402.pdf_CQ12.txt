I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, conservation biology, and ecological niche modeling, but it does not provide information about the specific type of machine learning or deep learning models used. The mentioned papers and articles seem to focus on bioclimatic modeling, citizen science, and species distribution modeling using tools like Maxent, but they do not mention deep learning models.
