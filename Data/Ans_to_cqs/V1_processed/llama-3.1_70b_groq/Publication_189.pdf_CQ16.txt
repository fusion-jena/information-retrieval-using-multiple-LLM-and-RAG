The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model is trained for 20 epochs with 500 steps each for training images and 100 steps for validation images. This suggests that the training process is completed after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being based on a specific stopping criterion such as validation loss plateau.
