Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research articles related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not provide specific details on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query. The context does not provide sufficient information to determine the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
