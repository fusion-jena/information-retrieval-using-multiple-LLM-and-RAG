Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on air quality, ecological informatics, and environmental science, with various research papers and studies on topics like predicting air quality, assessing nitrogen dioxide levels, and carbon sequestration.

However, one paper by Chianese et al. (2019) mentions the use of a multi-layer perceptron for predicting ambient particulate matter concentration, which is a type of neural network. Another paper by Navares and Aznarte (2020) uses a deep learning LSTM model for predicting air quality. While these papers discuss the use of deep learning models, they do not provide information on specific data annotation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
