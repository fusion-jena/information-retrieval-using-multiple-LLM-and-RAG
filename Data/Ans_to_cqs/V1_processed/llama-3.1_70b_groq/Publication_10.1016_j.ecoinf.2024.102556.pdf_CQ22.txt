Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the introduction of a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) to address shortcomings in feature learning, the use of Deep SORT algorithm with a novel residual network structure, and the employment of YOLOv7 as the baseline model. However, it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
