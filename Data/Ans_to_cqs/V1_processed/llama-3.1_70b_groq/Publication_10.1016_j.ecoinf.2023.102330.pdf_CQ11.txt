I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting and localizing northern bobwhite calls, but it does not provide information on where the pipeline is stored or shared. The context only mentions a reference to a previous study (Nolan et al., 2022) that developed the CNN model, but it does not provide a link to the repository where the pipeline is stored.
