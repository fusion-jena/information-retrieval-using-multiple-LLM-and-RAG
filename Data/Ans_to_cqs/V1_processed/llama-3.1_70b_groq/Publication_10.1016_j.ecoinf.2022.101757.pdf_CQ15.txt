Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of a pre-trained DeeplabV3+ model with the COCO dataset, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
