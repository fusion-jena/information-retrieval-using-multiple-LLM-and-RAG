Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a specific package (ppmlasso) and its functions for predicting intensity maps, but it does not discuss deep learning models or their preprocessing steps.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. These may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have a specific mean and standard deviation, often used in conjunction with normalization.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing or imputing missing values, and removing outliers or noisy data.

But please note that this information is not specific to the provided context, and the actual preprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture.

If you're looking for information on preprocessing steps for a specific deep learning model or dataset, I recommend consulting relevant documentation or research papers on the topic.
