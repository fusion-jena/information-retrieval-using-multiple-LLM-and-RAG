The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of a pre-trained detector model (MegaDetector) to produce crops from images, which are then embedded into a lower-dimensional space and used for active learning.

The context also mentions that the active learning procedure involves selecting samples to be labeled by an oracle, but it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used for labeling these samples. It only mentions that the oracle is used to label the selected samples, which are then added to the labeled set.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
