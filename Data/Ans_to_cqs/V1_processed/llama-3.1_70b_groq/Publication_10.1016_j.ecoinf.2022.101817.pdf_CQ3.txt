Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, including the VGG16 architecture and the classification of weather phenomena and underwater fish species. It also mentions the use of repeated random sub-sampling to generate different datasets and the training and testing of CNN models. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used to prepare the data for these tasks. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
