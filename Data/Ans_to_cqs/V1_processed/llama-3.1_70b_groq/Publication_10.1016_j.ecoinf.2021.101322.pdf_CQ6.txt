According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model (specifically, a CNN) include:

1. **Augmentation**: The images were augmented using rotations between 0 and 360 degrees, reflected by the vertical axis, and vertically shifted by +/- 5 pixels.
2. **Standard image normalization**: The 8-bit pixel values were mapped to floating-point values between 0 and 1.

These preprocessing steps were applied to the entire training dataset. Additionally, the dataset was randomly split into training, validation, and test sets, containing 70%, 15%, and 15% of the images, respectively.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention any specific cleaning steps, such as handling missing values or outliers. However, it does mention that the dataset was used for training a CNN, which suggests that the images were already labeled and prepared for training.
