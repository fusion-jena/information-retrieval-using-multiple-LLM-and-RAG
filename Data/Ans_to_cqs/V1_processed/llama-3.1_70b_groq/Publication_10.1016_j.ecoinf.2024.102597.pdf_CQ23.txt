Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. In fact, the text states that "the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning", suggesting that deep learning models were not actually used in this study.

However, the text does mention that the researchers used techniques such as hyperparameter optimization using random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods to improve the performance of their models. Additionally, the researchers used techniques such as cross-validation (specifically, GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn) to evaluate the performance of their models.

It's worth noting that the text does not specifically mention the use of techniques such as stratified splitting or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure the generalizability of the models.
