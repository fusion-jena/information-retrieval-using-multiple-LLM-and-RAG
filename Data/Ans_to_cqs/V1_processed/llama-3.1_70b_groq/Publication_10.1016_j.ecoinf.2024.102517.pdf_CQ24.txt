The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that "in each epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order" during the training process of the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the training process, but the specific strategies used to handle it are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of the Adam optimizer, which is a stochastic optimization algorithm that inherently involves randomness. However, the context does not provide information on how the randomness in the Adam optimizer is handled.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the query about the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
