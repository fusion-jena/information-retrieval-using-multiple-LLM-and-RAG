To ensure the generalizability of the model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the training dataset was divided into two parts, with 80% used for training/validation and the remaining 20% kept as unseen data for testing. This split helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting.

Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process. Cross-validation is a technique that helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data by training and testing the model on multiple subsets of the data. This helps to reduce the bias and variance of the model's performance estimate.

Furthermore, the use of 10-fold cross-validation also helps to partly delineate the cause-effect relationships in machine learning and confirm the generalization of the proposed method.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context. However, the use of cross-validation and splitting the data into training and testing sets helps to ensure the generalizability of the model.
