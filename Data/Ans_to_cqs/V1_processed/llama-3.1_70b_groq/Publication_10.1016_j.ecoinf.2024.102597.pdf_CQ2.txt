I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. The context does mention the use of satellite data from VIIRS and Landsat satellites, as well as hyperspectral data, but it does not specify the format of these data. Additionally, it mentions the use of Python and Anaconda for model development, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in the pipeline.
