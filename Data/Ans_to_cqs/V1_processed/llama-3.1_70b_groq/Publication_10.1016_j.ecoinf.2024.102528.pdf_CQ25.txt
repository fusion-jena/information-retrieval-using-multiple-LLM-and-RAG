The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the BirdNET Analyzer, is to allow the monitoring of a large number of bird species by their vocalizations over extended periods. This suggests that the model is used for classification, specifically for identifying bird species based on their vocalizations. The model is part of an automated framework that enables continuous bioacoustic monitoring, which implies that it is used for detection and classification of bird species in real-time or near-real-time.
