To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a 10-fold cross-validation was performed, where the dataset was split into 10 different sets by dividing the map into a 3 Ã— 3 grid and further splitting the central cell into two cells. This division was done to account for the varying terrain and map styles across the region. During training, 9 sets were used for training, and the remaining set was used for evaluation.

Additionally, the model was trained on a diverse dataset, as the division of the dataset into 10 sets ensured that the model was exposed to different terrain types and map styles. This helped to validate the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen areas.

Furthermore, the model was trained with a validation set, which consisted of 20% of the training samples. This validation set was used to prevent overfitting and to evaluate the model's performance during training.

The use of dropout with a rate of 0.3 and ADAM optimization with a learning rate of 0.0001 also helped to improve the model's generalizability by preventing overfitting and promoting stable training.

Overall, the combination of cross-validation, diverse dataset, and regularization techniques helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
