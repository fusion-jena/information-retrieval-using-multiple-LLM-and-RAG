Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the research design, data processing, and accuracy assessment of the LULC classification. It provides details on the MLP parameters and performance, as well as the accuracy assessment for LULC classification. However, it does not discuss the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this query.
