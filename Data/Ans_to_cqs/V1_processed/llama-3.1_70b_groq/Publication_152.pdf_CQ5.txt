The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the authors used a dataset of images of Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species, which was collected using a DJI Phantom 2 drone. The dataset was used to train a U-Net model for semantic segmentation. The context also mentions that the authors used RGB images as input for training the model, but it does not provide information on the size or composition of the dataset.
