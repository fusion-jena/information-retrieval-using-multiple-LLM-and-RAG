Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context provides information about the model's performance, such as F1 scores, and mentions that the data, code, and trained machine learning model are published, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameter optimization process.

Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
