I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a study that discusses the development and testing of a YOLOv8 model for detecting and counting NBSB in soybean fields, but it does not provide any information about a publicly available code repository. If you need to access the code, you may want to try contacting the authors or searching for a separate publication or repository that provides the code.
