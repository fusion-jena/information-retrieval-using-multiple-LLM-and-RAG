I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning approaches, specifically BirdNET, for automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, and mentions the accuracy of the model in detecting vocalizations. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
