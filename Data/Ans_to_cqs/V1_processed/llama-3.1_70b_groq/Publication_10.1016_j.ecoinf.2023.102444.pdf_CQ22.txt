The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used for the UMAP model as a binary classifier. The metrics used are:

* Area under the curve (AUC)
* Receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
* Kappa index (K)
* Point-biserial correlation (COR) index

These metrics are used to assess the performance of the UMAP model in distinguishing between presence (species points) and absence (background points). 

It's worth noting that the context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics. If you are looking for information on the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model, this context may not be relevant.
