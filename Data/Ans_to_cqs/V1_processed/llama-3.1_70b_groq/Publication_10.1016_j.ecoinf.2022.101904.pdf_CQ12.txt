The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models, including:

1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
2. Swin Transformer (a type of Transformer model)
3. 3DUNetGSFormer (a specific architecture that combines 3D UNet and Swin Transformer)
4. Vision Transformer (ViT)
5. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

These models are used for various tasks, such as feature extraction, classification, and mapping. The specific architecture and combination of models used in the pipeline are designed for complex wetland mapping tasks.
