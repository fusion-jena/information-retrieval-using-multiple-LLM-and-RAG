Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning with the ResNet50 model, as well as the implementation of a modified version of ResNet50 with two fully connected layers and a dropout layer to reduce overfitting. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm used, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
