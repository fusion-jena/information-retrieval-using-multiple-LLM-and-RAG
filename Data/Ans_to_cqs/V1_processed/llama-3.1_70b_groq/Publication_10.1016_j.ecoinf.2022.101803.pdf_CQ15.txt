Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to focus on ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, and their application in machine learning models, particularly in the context of XGBoost and random forests. It does not delve into deep learning or optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
