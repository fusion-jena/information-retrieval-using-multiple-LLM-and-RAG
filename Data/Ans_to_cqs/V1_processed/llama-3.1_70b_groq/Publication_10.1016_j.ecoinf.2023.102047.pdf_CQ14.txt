The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search operation. According to the provided context, the constant α, β, and γ are determined by the grid search operation. This suggests that the model's hyperparameters are optimized by systematically searching through a predefined grid of possible values for these constants, and selecting the combination that results in the best performance.
