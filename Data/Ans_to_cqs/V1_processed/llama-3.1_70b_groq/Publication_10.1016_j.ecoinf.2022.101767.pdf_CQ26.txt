Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological studies, video analysis, and statistics, but it does not touch on deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed techniques used to address data bias and imbalance in machine learning pipelines. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into subsets based on the class labels to maintain the same proportion of samples in each subset. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class to balance the data, while undersampling involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class.

Diverse data collection is also an important technique to address data bias by collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data represents the population of interest.

But, I must emphasize that these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, and I'm just providing general information on these techniques.
