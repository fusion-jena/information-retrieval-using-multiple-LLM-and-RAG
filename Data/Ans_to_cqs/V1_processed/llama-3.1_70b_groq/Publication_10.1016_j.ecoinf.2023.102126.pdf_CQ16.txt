Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to the evaluation of data repositories and datasets based on the FAIR principles, and the development of tools and methodologies for assessing data quality.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question as it is not related to the provided context.
