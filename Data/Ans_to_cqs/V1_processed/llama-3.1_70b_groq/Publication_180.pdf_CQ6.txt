According to the provided context, one of the advantages of using TensorFlow is that it eliminates the need for preprocessing images for the identification system. This means that the researchers did not have to perform any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. They compared the classification performance of TensorFlow based on both cleaned and raw images for the Mexican species, and found that preprocessing was not necessary.
