The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the audio data was segmented into 8-second clips to increase the likelihood of capturing both biological and anthropogenic sound sources in their entirety. This could be seen as a form of diverse data collection, as it aims to capture a wide range of sounds.

Additionally, the context mentions that the data was split into five training folds, which could be a form of stratified splitting. However, it does not provide enough information to confirm this.

There is no mention of oversampling or undersampling techniques being used to address data bias.

Therefore, the only technique that can be inferred from the provided context is diverse data collection, and possibly stratified splitting, although this is not explicitly confirmed.
