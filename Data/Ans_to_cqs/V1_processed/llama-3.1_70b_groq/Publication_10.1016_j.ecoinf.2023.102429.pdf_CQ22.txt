The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models in the provided context are:

1. Coefficient of determination (R2)
2. Root-mean-square error (RMSE)
3. Ratio of performance to deviation (RPD)
4. Ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ)

These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of calibrated and validated models, particularly in the context of estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations using visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral data. The R2 value measures the goodness of fit of the model, while RMSE measures the average difference between predicted and actual values. RPD and RPIQ provide additional insights into the model's performance, with RPD being the ratio of standard deviation to RMSE and RPIQ considering prediction errors and variations in observations simultaneously.
