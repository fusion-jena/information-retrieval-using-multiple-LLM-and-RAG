Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on model complexity, feature selection, and model explainability, but it does not delve into the details of postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the use of 5-fold cross-validation loss during model development, which suggests that some form of evaluation metric calculation is involved. But it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
