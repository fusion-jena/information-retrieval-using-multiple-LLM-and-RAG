I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the evaluation of the performance of CNNs trained on different annotation sets, the use of datasets containing SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale's Dcall, and the importance of annotator contact and methods to assess inter-annotator variability. However, it does not provide information about the code repository or where it can be found.
