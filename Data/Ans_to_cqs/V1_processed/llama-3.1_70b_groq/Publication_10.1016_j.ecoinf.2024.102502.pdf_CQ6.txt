Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data filtering (2.1) and data scaling (2.3). 

Data scaling is further divided into spatial and temporal scaling. Spatial scaling involves applying a scaling process to each metric of the time series, which can be done using a parametrizable function such as addTexture_3 Ã— 3_Mean. This function applies a spatial moving window with a size of 3 pixels and aggregates the data using the mean. Other aggregation formulas such as median or standard deviation can also be used.

Temporal scaling involves aggregating data across different temporal scales, which can be done using a formula that defines how data is temporally aggregated. The context mentions that different scaling domains have been suggested by Fritsch et al. (2020), and the approach conforms to a "pre-modelling scaling" protocol.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the context whether normalization or cleaning are part of the preprocessing steps. However, data filtering is mentioned, which might involve cleaning the data. Normalization is not mentioned at all. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer is that data filtering and data scaling are involved in the preprocessing steps, but it is not clear if normalization or cleaning are part of these steps.
