The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model performance was evaluated using three error statistics: R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). 

Additionally, the context mentions that the study systematically evaluated the "mtry" parameter from 1 to 10, aiming to strike a balance between stability and minimize the RMSE. This suggests that the study may have used the RMSE as a metric to evaluate the model's performance during training and potentially as a stopping criterion. However, it is not explicitly stated that a validation loss plateau was used as a criterion to determine when training is complete.
