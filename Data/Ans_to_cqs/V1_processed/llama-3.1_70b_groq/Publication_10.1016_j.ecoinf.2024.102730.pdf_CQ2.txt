Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. Several papers mention the use of images for tasks such as plant species identification (Waldchen & Mader, 2018; Barr√© et al., 2017), facial recognition in wildlife (Clapham et al., 2020; Zmarz et al., 2019), and vegetation monitoring (Beck et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2003).

Some papers also mention the use of remote sensing data, such as MODIS NDVI (Beck et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2003), which is a type of satellite imagery data. Additionally, one paper mentions the use of video data for chimpanzee face recognition (Zmarz et al., 2019).

There is no mention of audio data being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not explicitly mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline, but it is possible that they may be used for storing or processing data in some cases.

Overall, the primary data formats used in the deep learning pipeline appear to be image and remote sensing data, with some instances of video data being used as well.
