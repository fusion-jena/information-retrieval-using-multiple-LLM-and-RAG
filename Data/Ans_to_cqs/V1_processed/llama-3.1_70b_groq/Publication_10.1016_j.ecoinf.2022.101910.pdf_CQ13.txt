Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions that the BirdNET model is a deep neural network, but it does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used to train the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
