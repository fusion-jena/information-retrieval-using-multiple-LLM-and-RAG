Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to animal tracking and behavior recognition using machine learning models, but it does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
