Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on various topics related to water resource management, ecological preservation, and the application of machine learning and genetic programming techniques to these fields.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness is often introduced through random initialization of weights, random shuffling of data, and random selection of mini-batches. To ensure reproducibility and consistency in results, it is common to set a random seed value, which ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the code is run.

Some strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

* Setting a fixed random seed value for the random number generator
* Using a fixed shuffling of the data
* Using a fixed selection of mini-batches
* Averaging the results of multiple runs with different random seeds

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide specific information on these strategies or any other methods for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
