I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses various algorithms for estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using remote sensing data, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), but does not provide information on the deployment platform.
