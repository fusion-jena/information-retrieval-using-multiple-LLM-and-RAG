The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the model's properties, the comparison with the Von Neumann model, and potential future research directions, such as modifying the update criterion, optimizing the scope, and exploring variance reduction strategies. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
