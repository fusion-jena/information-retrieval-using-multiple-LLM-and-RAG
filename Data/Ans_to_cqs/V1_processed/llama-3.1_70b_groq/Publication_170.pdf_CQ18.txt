The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating both errors and time costs. The iteration termination condition of the model is set to stop when the loss rate of the model is less than a preset threshold (ɛ = 1.0 × 10^(-4)). Additionally, the model error evaluation uses three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error, which are defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) respectively. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the model on a test set (Test) during different training phases.
