The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the models are used for downstream tasks such as recognition and detection.

The context mentions that ResNet, a CNN-like model, has exhibited superior performance in various downstream recognition and detection tasks. It also mentions that the transformer-like visual models, such as ViT, have demonstrated excellent performance in a wide range of downstream tasks.

Additionally, the context mentions that the selected CNN-like model, ResNet-50, has a fully connected layer at the end for classification, which suggests that the model is used for classification tasks.

However, the context does not provide information on whether the models are used for segmentation tasks. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the purpose of the deep learning models is likely for classification and detection tasks, but the information on segmentation tasks is not available.
