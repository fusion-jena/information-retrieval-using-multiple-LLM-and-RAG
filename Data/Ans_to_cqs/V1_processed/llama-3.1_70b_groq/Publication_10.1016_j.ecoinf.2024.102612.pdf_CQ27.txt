Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the training and testing of the model, as well as its application in fuel model retrieval. The context mentions that the trained model was used to infer real MS point clouds, and the results were used as inputs for a decision tree scheme to retrieve final fuel models. However, it does not provide information on how the model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
