The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the Mask R-CNN model is used for object detection, and the ResNet variants are used for action recognition. The ResNet variants are also used as the backbone for the FGFA architecture. Additionally, a flow network is implemented using SPyNet, which is also a type of CNN. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
