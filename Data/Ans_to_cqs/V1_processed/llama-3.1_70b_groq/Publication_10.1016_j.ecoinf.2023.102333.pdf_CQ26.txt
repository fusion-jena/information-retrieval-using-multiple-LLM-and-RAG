Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization, deep learning architectures, and applications in remote sensing and image processing.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias, although it's not directly mentioned in the provided context. Common techniques used to address data bias include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of labels.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of samples from the minority class to balance the dataset.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the dataset.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation.

These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address data bias and ensure that the model is trained on a representative dataset. However, I couldn't find any specific information on these techniques in the provided context.
