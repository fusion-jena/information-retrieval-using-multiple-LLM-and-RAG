Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific post-processing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on spectral analysis and pre-processing, as well as the results of a soil nutrient concentration analysis.

However, it does mention the calculation of certain metrics, such as R2, RMSE, RPD, and RPIQ, which are used to evaluate the performance of the model. These metrics are calculated using equations (1) to (4) provided in the context.

It's worth noting that the context mentions the use of MATLAB R2016a and the libsvm package for model training, but it does not provide information on the specific post-processing steps involved after model training.
