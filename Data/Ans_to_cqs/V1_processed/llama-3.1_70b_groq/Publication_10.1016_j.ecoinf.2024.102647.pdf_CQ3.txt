I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to soil salinity mapping, groundwater dynamics, and statistical learning, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
