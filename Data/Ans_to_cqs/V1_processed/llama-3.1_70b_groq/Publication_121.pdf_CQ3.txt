Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the model training process, feature extraction, and transfer learning, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
