The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "dive visual censuses" performed by divers as a method for collecting data on fish species. This method involves divers manually counting and observing fish species during dives. 

Additionally, the context mentions the limitations of this method, such as depth and time constraints, and the slow rate of data collection. It also mentions the compilation of a global fish biodiversity database, but it does not specify the methods used for collecting the data for this database.

There is no mention of sensors or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the provided context.
