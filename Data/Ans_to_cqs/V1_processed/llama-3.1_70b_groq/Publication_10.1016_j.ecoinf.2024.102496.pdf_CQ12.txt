I don't know. The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any specific type of neural network architecture such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context appears to be related to a decision support tool for equitable nutrient reduction, and it discusses features such as zooming, searching, and filtering, but it does not provide information about the underlying machine learning models or algorithms used in the pipeline.
