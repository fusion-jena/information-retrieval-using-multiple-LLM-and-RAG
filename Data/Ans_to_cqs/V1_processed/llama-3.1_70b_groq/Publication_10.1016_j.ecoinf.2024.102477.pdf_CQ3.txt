I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on time-series forecasting using deep learning methods, specifically SLSTM and SGRU models, and their applications in predicting agricultural product sales and air pollution. It also mentions SVR, a machine learning method, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a relevant answer to the query.
