Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was fine-tuned using a maximum of 1000 five-second noisy and clean samples, which suggests that the dataset used for fine-tuning was relatively small.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was pre-trained, which implies that it was trained on a larger dataset before being fine-tuned on the specific dataset of interest. However, the details of the pre-training dataset and the fine-tuning process are not provided.

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, it is unclear what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that collecting clean data is infeasible in many cases, and that recording clean data may not be representative of the wider population. This suggests that the dataset used for fine-tuning may not have been diverse or representative, which could impact the generalizability of the model.
