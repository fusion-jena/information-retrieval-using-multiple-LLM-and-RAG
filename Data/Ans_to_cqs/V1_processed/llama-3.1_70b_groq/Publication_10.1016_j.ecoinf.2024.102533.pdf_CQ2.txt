Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references and the study's focus on fish grading and freshness evaluation, it can be inferred that image data might be used. For instance, the study by Lalabadi et al. (2020) mentions the use of eyes and gills color features, which suggests the use of image data. Additionally, the study by Arora et al. (2022) mentions a low-cost imaging framework for freshness evaluation from multifocal fish tissues, further supporting the possibility of image data being used. However, without explicit mention, it is uncertain whether other data formats like audio, video, or CSV are used in the pipeline.
