Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the application of deep learning methodologies to underwater fish video processing, the tradeoff between development time and accuracy, and the use of ensemble methods like XGBoost. It does not delve into the specifics of training completion criteria.

However, it does mention that the authors compared their semi-weakly-supervised model to a fully-supervised DNN, which suggests that they may have used some form of validation or testing to evaluate the performance of their models. But the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
