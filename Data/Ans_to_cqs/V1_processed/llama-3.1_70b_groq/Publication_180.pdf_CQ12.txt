The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that the researchers used TensorFlow, an open-source software platform for deep learning, and that they employed a deep neural network (DNN) for the task of automated Chagas disease vector identification. However, it does not specify whether the DNN is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of model.
