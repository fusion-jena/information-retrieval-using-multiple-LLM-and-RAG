The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is trained for the classification of fish events. The model takes input features extracted from an Autoencoder model and uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict the event class. The MLP consists of four fully connected layers and uses a loss function (either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss) to update the model parameters and perform the training. The final layer of the MLP has 12 neurons, each corresponding to one of the events, and the maximum neuron value is used for predicting the event class.
