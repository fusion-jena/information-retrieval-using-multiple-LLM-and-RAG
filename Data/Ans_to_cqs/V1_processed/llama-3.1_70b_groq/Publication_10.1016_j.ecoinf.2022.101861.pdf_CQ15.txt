I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to bird research, citizen science, and ecology, with no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques. The papers and articles mentioned seem to focus on bird species, their habitats, and research methods, but do not discuss machine learning or optimization techniques in detail. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
