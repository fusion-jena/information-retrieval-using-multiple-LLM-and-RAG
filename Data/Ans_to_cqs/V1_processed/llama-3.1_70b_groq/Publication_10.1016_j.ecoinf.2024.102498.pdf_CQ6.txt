Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the limitations of using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for classification tasks, the use of traditional machine learning models (CART, RF, GTB, and SVM) within GEE, and the potential benefits of using deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for land use and land cover (LULC) classification.

However, it is mentioned that deep learning techniques, like CNNs, can automatically extract sophisticated features from satellite imagery, which implies that some form of preprocessing might be involved in preparing the data for these models. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps are not detailed in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
