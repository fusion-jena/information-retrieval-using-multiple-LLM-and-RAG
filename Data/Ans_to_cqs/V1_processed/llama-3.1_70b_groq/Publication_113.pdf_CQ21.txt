The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the classifier achieves 93.2% overall accuracy after the first 30,000 active queries, which suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is performed.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model can be employed to perform tasks such as:

1. Determining if an image is empty or contains animals
2. Counting the number of animals in an image
3. Localizing animals in an image to crop out background pixels

These tasks suggest that the model may be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, but the specific postprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
