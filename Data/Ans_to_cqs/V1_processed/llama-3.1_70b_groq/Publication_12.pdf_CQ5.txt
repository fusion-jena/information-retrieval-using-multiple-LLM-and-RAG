The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the text mentions that the datasets used are specific to the task of bat species classification. 

The datasets used are created from audio-files of bat calls, which are converted into images of size 64*64 pixels. These images are then divided into two datasets: a training dataset with 85% of the images (111,244 images) and a validation dataset with 15% of the images (19,614 images). 

Additionally, the text mentions that the datasets are created using a Python script called "Making_dataset.py" in Waveman, and that the datasets are balanced to ensure that rare species are not under-represented.
