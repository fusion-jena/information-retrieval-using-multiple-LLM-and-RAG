Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. It discusses the use of U-Net models, a type of CNN, and the importance of labeling data for training these models. However, it does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
