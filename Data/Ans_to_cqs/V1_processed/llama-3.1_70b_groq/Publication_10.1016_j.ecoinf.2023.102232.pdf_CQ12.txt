I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It mentions the use of a Python package called Ray for parallel computing, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used. The context appears to be focused on a physiologically based model for Drosophila suzukii, and the use of a genetic algorithm for optimization, but it does not mention deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
