Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the training process of the YOLOv5 model, including the use of validation data to prevent overfitting and the evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as average precision (AP) and mean AP (mAP). However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, including model serialization or platform selection.
