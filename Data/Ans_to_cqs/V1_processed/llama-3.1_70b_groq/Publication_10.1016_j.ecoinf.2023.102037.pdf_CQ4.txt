Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on image classification algorithms, object detection, and pest species identification using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It discusses various studies and their results, including the use of YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 models, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
