Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The text primarily focuses on the model training process, the use of the signature method, and the evaluation of the model's performance. 

However, it does mention that the prediction error was obtained by calculating Ì‚ym+ma - ym+ma at different starting times. This suggests that some form of error calculation or evaluation was performed, but the specific details of the postprocessing steps are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
