Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the network is trained with the mean scaled absolute error as regression loss and utilizes only horizontal flipping for data augmentation. Additionally, it mentions that the goal is to extract plant cover information without training on actual annotated plant cover data. However, it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
