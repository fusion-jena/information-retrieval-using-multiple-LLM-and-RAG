The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the results of experiments with different pre-training datasets and fine-tuning strategies, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
