I don't know. The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a research study on insect recognition using machine learning models, and it discusses data splitting, model performance, and validation procedures, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
