Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text only discusses the architecture of the deep learning-based classifiers, the modifications made to the architectures, and potential directions for future research, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training the models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
