I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of machine learning techniques for classifying aquatic plant communities using remote sensing techniques, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
