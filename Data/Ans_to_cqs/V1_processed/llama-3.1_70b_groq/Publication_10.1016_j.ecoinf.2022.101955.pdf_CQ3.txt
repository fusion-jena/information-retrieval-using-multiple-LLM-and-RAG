Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms, including kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF, for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It discusses the architectures and parameters used for these algorithms, such as the number of neurons in the input and output layers, but does not delve into data annotation techniques.

However, it does mention that the LULC classes of the test datasets were defined as target variables and the band reflectance values as presensed data, suggesting that some form of data labeling or annotation was performed. Nevertheless, the specific techniques used for data annotation are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
