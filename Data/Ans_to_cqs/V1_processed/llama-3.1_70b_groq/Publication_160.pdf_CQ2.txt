The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images. The context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, such as species recognition and coral reef species identification. It also mentions the use of ImageNet, a large-scale image recognition dataset, as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of CNNs.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of underwater video for species recognition, but it does not provide information on the specific data format used for video processing. It is likely that the video data is converted into image frames or other formats suitable for processing by CNNs.

There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images, with possible use of video data converted into image frames.
