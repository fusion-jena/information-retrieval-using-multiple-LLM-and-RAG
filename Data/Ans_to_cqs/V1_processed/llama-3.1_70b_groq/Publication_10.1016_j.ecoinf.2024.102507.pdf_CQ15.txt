Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the process of building and training the model using Keras and TensorFlow, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
