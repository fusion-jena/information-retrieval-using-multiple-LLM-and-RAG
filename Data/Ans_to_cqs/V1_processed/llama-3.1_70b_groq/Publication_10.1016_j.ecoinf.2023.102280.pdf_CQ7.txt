Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of collecting clean data for bioacoustics applications, the limitations of existing deep noise reduction methods, and the potential of using raw waveform data and transformer attention mechanisms. It also mentions the importance of data requirements and data augmentation techniques for fine-tuning audio enhancement models. However, it does not provide information on how to split the data for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
