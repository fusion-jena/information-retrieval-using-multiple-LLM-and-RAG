The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. According to the text, a study used deep learning models to classify three sympatric otter species, and the model was able to effectively utilize lower-quality data. Additionally, the text mentions that the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method uses machine learning models to classify footprints, but it does not provide further details on the specific type of classification task.
