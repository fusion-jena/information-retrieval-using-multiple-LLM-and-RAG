I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) as classifiers, but it does not mention any deep learning models. Additionally, the context mentions the use of CNN models in a separate study (Li et al., 2022), but it does not indicate that CNN models are used in the pipeline being described.
