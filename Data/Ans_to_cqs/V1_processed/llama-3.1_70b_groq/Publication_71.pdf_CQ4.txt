The provided context mentions that augmenting the training dataset using different techniques could be a potential strategy to mitigate the issues when test data characteristics differ from the training data. Specifically, the following data augmentation techniques are mentioned:

1. Adding vertically and horizontally flipped versions of the training images.
2. Shifting the training images.
3. Rotating the training images.
4. Adding noisy versions of the training images.
5. Using different brightness levels.

These techniques are mentioned as potential strategies to improve the performance of deep learning methods when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when the training data characteristics differ from the testing data. However, it is not explicitly stated that these techniques are applied in the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context (DeepLabV3+).
