The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, model architecture, and hyperparameters used for training the Mask R-CNN model, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

However, it does mention that the system is most compatible with TensorFlow version 1.14.0 and Keras version 2.2.4, along with Python 3.6. This suggests that the model was likely trained and potentially deployed using these frameworks, but the exact deployment process is not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
