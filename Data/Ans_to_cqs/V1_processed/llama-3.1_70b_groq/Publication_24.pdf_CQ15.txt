Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the parameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were "learnt from training data" and that the network's parameters were "optimised to improve classification performance during training", but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used (e.g., SGD, Adam).
