Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the model, particularly the use of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and the comparison of different ResNet models. It discusses the advantages of using FPN and how it can complement feature maps from different layers, but it does not provide information on the dataset or evaluation methods used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
