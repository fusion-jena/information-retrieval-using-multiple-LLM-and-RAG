The provided context mentions that image preprocessing was conducted using Python with the OpenCV library. The last step of preprocessing involved image inversion, where white pixels (representing markings) were switched to black pixels, and the black pixels (representing the background) were switched to white pixels. However, it does not mention other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. It only mentions that the images were inverted, which is a specific preprocessing step. 

Additionally, it is mentioned that the model was trained on two different datasets: the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and the authors' own dataset of clusters of extracted numbers. However, it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to these datasets before training the model. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is image inversion. Other preprocessing steps may have been applied, but they are not mentioned in the provided text.
