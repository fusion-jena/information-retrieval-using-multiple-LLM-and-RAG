The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer, except for one instance where it mentions that the model was fine-tuned at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10âˆ’4). However, it does not provide information about the initial learning rate or the optimizer used.
