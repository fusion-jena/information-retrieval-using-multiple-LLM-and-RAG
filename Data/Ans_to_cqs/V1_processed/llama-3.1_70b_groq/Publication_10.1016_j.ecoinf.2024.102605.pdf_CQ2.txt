Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image-based. The context mentions various studies and papers related to image processing, remote sensing, and computer vision, such as:

* Analysis of content-based image retrieval for plant leaf diseases using color, shape, and texture features
* Hyperspectral imaging for early identification of strawberry leaves diseases with machine learning and spectral fingerprint features
* Image differencing of normalized indices for monitoring oil spills in mangrove areas
* Multispectral features and machine learning for identifying damage caused by insects in forests

These studies suggest that image data is a primary input for the deep learning pipeline. However, it is also possible that other data formats, such as CSV (Comma Separated Values), may be used for storing and processing metadata or feature data extracted from the images.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is:

Image data formats are primarily used in the deep learning pipeline, with possible use of CSV for storing and processing metadata or feature data.
