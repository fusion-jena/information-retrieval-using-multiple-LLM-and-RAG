The text does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. It mentions the use of the FIT method, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in this method. In fact, it states that "No hyperparameter tuning has been conducted" and that "all models of the same species were executed with the default FIT parameters on the full dataset." Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to this question.
