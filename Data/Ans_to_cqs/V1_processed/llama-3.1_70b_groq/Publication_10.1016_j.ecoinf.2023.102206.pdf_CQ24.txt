Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on transfer learning (TL) approaches, including Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) and traditional transfer learning methods, to address issues like overconfidence and data distribution differences between source and target domains.

However, it mentions that Salaken et al. (2019) employed deep learning with a small sample of the target domain as a seed to transform the source domain dataset. This might imply the use of a random seed value, but it does not provide further details on strategies for handling randomness.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
