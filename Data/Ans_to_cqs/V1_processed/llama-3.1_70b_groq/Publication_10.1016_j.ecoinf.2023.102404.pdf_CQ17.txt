Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, machine learning, and data analysis, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, I can mention that the context does mention the use of techniques to prevent overfitting in a machine learning model, such as tuning the 'minLeafPopulation' parameter to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while capturing meaningful patterns in the data. But this is not specific to deep learning or the mentioned regularization methods.

Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline.

 I don't know.
