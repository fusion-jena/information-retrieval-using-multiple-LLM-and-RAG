The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention the use of a "random/speciÔ¨Åc background" class in the species database, which contains 116,820 samples. This class is likely used to account for variations in the background of the images, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of back-propagation and gradient-based descent to update the weights of the neurons in the network. These methods are commonly used in deep learning to optimize the network's performance, but they do not provide information on how randomness is handled.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
