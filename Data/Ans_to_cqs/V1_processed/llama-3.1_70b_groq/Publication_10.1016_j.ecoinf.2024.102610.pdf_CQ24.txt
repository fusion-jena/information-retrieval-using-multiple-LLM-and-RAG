The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on the use of machine learning techniques, specifically random forests, for predicting relative tsetse abundance in Kenya. It discusses the use of feature elimination techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF) to prevent overfitting and improve model performance. However, it does not address the specific question of handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
