Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and evaluation of the proposed classification method, as well as the comparison with state-of-the-art methods. It discusses the use of focal loss, overlap sampler technique, and other components of the model, but does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
