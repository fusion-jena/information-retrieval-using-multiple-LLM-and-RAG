Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, Scaling, etc. The context only mentions that Sousa et al. (2020) proposed a transfer learning approach with data augmentation techniques for wildfire detection to overcome data limitations, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
