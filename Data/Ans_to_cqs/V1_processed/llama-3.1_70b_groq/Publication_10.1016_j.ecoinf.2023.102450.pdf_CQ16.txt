Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a dataset of videos with animal motion trajectories and some metrics such as cycle time, prediction error, and cross-correlation coefficients. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
