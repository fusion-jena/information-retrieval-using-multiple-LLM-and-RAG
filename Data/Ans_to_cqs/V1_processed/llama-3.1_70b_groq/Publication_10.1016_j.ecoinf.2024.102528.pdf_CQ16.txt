I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. It appears to be related to a study on bird vocalizations, specifically the Eurasian collared dove and the common crane. The text discusses the use of the BirdNET-Analyzer to identify species and extract vocalization data, as well as the application of species-specific thresholds to filter out predictions with lower confidence scores. However, there is no mention of training or validation loss plateau, which suggests that this information is not relevant to the provided context.
