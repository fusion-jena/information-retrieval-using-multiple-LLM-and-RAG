I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context appears to be a research paper or academic text that discusses various studies and models related to plant species classification, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
