Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the proposed approach, data augmentation, and the performance of the SCAM-Herb model, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
