The provided context does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the models are to be deployed on IoT edge devices and that the size of each model is an important consideration. It also mentions the use of TensorFlow Lite and Raspberry Pi, which suggests that the models may have been optimized and deployed using these technologies.

The context does mention that the models were implemented using Keras, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were serialized or deployed on the edge devices. It is likely that the models were converted to a format compatible with TensorFlow Lite and then deployed on the Raspberry Pi, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, while we can make some educated guesses about the deployment process, the exact steps followed to deploy the trained deep learning model are not specified in the provided context.
