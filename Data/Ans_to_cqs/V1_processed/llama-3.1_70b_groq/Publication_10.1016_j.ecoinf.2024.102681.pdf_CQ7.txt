Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the use of a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year to generate 42 distinct datasets, but it does not provide information on how these datasets are further split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or k-fold cross-validation. The specific criteria used to split the data can depend on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.

In this case, since the context does not provide explicit information on the data splitting criteria, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
