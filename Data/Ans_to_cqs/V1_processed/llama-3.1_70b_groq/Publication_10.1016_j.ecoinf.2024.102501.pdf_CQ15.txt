The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention the use of optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for solving model parameter problems, like the number of neurons in neural networks or error penalty factor in SVM. Additionally, it mentions the use of other optimization algorithms like the multi-verse optimizer for parameter optimization. 

But, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for training deep learning models like LSTM or GRU. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
