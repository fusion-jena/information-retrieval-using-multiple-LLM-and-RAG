Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the hyperparameter tuning process, the selection of the best model, and the performance evaluation metrics used. However, it does not provide information on how the dataset was split, whether cross-validation was used, or if the dataset was diverse and representative.

The context only mentions that the dataset was standardized to reduce the influence of outliers, which is a good practice for improving model performance. However, this does not directly address the question of generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
