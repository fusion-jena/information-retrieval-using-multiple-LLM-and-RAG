Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that data augmentation is used to improve the accuracy of the teacher model, but it does not provide details on the techniques used.

However, it does mention that the teacher model is re-trained using augmented DT (Decision Trees) and generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. This suggests that some form of data augmentation is being used, but the specific techniques are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
