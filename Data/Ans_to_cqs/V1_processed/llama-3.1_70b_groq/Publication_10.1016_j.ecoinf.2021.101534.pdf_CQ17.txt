Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques and the training process of a sound identification model using YOLOv5s. It discusses the use of default data augmentation, including scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation, but does not mention regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline in this context.
