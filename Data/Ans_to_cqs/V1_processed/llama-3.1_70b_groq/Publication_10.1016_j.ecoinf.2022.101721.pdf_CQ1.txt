Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to statistical analysis, species identification, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, it does mention the use of observed data, which suggests that the data may be collected through observations or surveys. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a full sample (N = 10,000), which could imply that the data is collected through a large-scale survey or dataset.

It's also worth noting that the context mentions the use of machine learning for species identification, which could involve the use of sensors or other data collection methods. However, without more information, it's impossible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
