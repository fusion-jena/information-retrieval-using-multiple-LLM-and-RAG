The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is primarily used to process "gridded data of a fixed size", which suggests that the data may be in a format such as images or time series data. Additionally, the text mentions that the dataset compiled for the study includes a "drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020", which suggests that the data may be in a format such as CSV or a similar time series data format. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact data formats used in the pipeline.
