The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset was randomly selected from the remaining sites, which could be a form of random sampling. 

Additionally, the context mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can choose the features that discriminate different classes in datasets without being specified a priori, and can take advantage of large quantities of training data. This suggests that the CNNs used in this study may be able to learn from the data and adapt to any biases present, but it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias.

The context also mentions that the authors used different normalisation strategies for preprocessing spectrograms, but this is not directly related to addressing data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be said that random sampling may be used, and the CNNs may be able to adapt to biases in the data.
