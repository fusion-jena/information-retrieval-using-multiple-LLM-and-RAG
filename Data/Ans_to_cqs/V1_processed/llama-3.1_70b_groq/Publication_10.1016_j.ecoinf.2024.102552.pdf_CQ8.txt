I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of machine learning tools for ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on where the code for the pipeline is stored. The paper does mention the use of QGIS and R for image processing and analysis, but it does not provide a link to a code repository.
