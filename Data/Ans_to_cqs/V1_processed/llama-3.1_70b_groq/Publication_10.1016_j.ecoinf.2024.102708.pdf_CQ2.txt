The text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses image data, as the study involves using drone imagery and deep learning for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters. The text mentions "mudflats and rocky shore imagery", which suggests that the input data is in the form of images. No other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, are mentioned in the provided context.
