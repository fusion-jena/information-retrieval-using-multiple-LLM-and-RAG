Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the evaluation of a model using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and comparing the results with field data and GEDI data. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or others.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
