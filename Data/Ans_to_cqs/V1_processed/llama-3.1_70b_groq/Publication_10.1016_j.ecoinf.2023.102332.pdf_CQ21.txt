Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data extraction, preprocessing, and word embedding techniques (Word2vec) used for analyzing hikers' perceptions and landscape features. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
