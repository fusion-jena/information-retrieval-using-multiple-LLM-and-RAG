Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The context primarily discusses the use of the LSTM model for time series data prediction and its comparison with other models, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
