To deploy the trained deep learning model, a containerization system was used. Specifically, Docker was utilized to build, distribute, and run the containerized application. The container was then hosted with Google Cloud Run, a service used to build and deploy containerized applications. This process allowed for the deployment of the trained model as a web application to detect alates on sorghum leaves automatically. 

Note that the provided context does not mention model serialization explicitly. However, it can be inferred that the trained model was likely serialized and packaged into a Docker container as part of the deployment process.
