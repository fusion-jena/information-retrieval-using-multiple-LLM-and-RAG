The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is used to classify images of plants into different species. The study employs various deep learning models, including InceptionResNetV2, Xception, ResNet50, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and GoogleNet, to identify plant species from images. The models are fine-tuned and optimized using Bayesian optimization to achieve the best performance. The performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score, are evaluated for each model on two datasets, UBD_45 and VP_200. The results show that the models achieve high accuracy in classifying plant species, with the highest testing accuracy of 96.7% achieved by InceptionResNetV2 on the UBD_45 dataset.
