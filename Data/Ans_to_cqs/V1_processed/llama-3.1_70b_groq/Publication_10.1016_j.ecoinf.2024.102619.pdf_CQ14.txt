According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a k-fold (k = 5) cross-validated fine grid-search on the training data. This approach is specifically mentioned for the SVMs, where the computational efficiency and few hyperparameters required allow for a relatively quick optimization process. For the non-linear RBF SVM, the hyperparameters C and γ are searched within specific ranges (C = 2^3, 2^3.25, …, 2^7 and γ = 2^-13 & 2^-11). The same hyperparameter search is applied to the linear SVM for its sole parameter C.
