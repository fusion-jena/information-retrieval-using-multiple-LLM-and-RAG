Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on the ADE20K dataset, which is a large-scale dataset developed by the MIT Torralba team. This dataset is focused on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor objects, and it has been widely used in the field of semantic segmentation.

Additionally, the context mentions that 55 outdoor visual landscape elements from the ADE20K dataset were used in this study. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse set of outdoor landscape elements, which could help improve its generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Therefore, I do not know if these techniques were used in this study.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model is a pre-trained model, specifically the deeplabv3 + resnet269 model, which is a widely used model in the field of semantic segmentation. This suggests that the model has been trained on a large-scale dataset and has been fine-tuned for the task of semantic segmentation. However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
