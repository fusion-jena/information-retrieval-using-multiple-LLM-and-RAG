Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to focus on machine learning algorithms and ensemble modeling approaches for habitat suitability prediction, species distribution modeling, and microbiome-based classification problems. It mentions various machine learning algorithms, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and others, but does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
