The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the value of Î³ (a hyper-parameter) is experimentally chosen and then kept constant at 10% for all experiments of IFTL. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization technique. Therefore, the answer to this query is that the context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized.
