Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context mainly focuses on the implementation details, experimental results, and the loss function used for training the model. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
