Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The texts primarily focus on the application of deep learning and other machine learning techniques to various tasks such as image segmentation, object detection, and classification in the fields of remote sensing, ecology, and forestry. They do not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline, including regularization methods.

However, it is worth noting that the texts do mention the use of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), faster R-CNN, and PointNet, but they do not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
