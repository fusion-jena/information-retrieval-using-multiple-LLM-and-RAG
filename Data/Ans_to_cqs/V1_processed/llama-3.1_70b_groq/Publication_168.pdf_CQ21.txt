Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the experiment setup, the proposed SSPCNN model, and the results obtained. 

However, it does mention that the classification map of the whole image is shown in Fig. 6, which suggests that some form of visualization or mapping is performed after the model training. Additionally, the context mentions that the classification performance is evaluated, which implies that some metrics calculation is performed. 

But, the specific postprocessing steps involved, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of confusion matrices, or generation of saliency maps, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
