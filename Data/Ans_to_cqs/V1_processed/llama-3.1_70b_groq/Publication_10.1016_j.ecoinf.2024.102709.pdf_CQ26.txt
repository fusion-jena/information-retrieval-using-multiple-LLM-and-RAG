The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model was trained and tested on a specific split of the data, which achieved the highest mAP50 (0.987). This suggests that the data was split in a way that optimized the model's performance, but it does not provide information on whether techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling were used to address data bias.

The context does mention that the model was tested on a test dataset of preprocessed original images, and that the results showed low accuracy for certain digits (0, 2, and 5). This could indicate that there is a bias in the data, but it does not provide information on how this bias was addressed.

The only technique mentioned in the context that could potentially be used to address data bias is the use of a "best split" of the data, which is mentioned as being used to achieve high accuracy on the test dataset. However, this is not a standard technique for addressing data bias, and it is not clear how this split was determined.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine what techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
