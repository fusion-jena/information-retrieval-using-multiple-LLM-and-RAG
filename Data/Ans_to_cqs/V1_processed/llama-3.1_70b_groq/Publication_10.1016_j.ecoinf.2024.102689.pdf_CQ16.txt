Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text discusses the methodology of conducting rigorous folded cross-validation, evaluating the model's performance, and comparing it to benchmark models. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training, such as validation loss plateau or other convergence criteria.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
