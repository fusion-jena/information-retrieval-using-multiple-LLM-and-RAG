The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does discuss two methods for dealing with multi-variate varying length audio data: 

1. Repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2 seconds.
2. Directly resizing the audio image to a fixed size.

These methods can be considered as techniques to handle varying length audio data, but they are not traditional data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
