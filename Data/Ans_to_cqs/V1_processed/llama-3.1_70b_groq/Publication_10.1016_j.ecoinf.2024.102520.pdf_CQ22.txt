The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation of spatial predictions using certain metrics. 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the spatial predictions are:

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
3. Goodness of Fit (G) 

These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the spatial predictions, with G being a measure of how well the predictions fit the actual data, and MSE and RMSE being measures of the average difference between predicted and actual values.
