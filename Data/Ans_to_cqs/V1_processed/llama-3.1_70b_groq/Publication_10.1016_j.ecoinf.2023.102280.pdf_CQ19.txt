Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models for noise reduction techniques. The context primarily focuses on the architectures and methods used, such as U-net and transformer attention mechanisms, but does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models.

However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that the models are likely implemented using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, as these are commonly used frameworks in the field of deep learning. For example, the reference to "zenodo.3243139" suggests that the code for the model may be available on Zenodo, a repository for research data and code, but the specific framework used is not mentioned.

Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question of which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
