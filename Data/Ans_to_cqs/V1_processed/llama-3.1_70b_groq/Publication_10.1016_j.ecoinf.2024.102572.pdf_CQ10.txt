I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of Python's Direct Application Programming Interface (API) to retrieve picture data for forest fire point information and the use of machine learning techniques to classify fire-damaged monuments, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
