Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be related to satellite imagery and remote sensing data.

The context mentions the use of MODIS-TERRA sensor data, specifically the MOD11A2 product, which provides 8-day temporal and 1 km spatial resolutions covering 2005-2018. This suggests that the data format used is likely to be a type of raster or grid-based format, possibly in a format such as GeoTIFF or HDF.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Landsat data, which is also a type of satellite imagery. This further supports the idea that the data format used is likely to be related to remote sensing data.

However, it is not possible to determine the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
