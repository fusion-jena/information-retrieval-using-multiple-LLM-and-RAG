Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The section "3.3 Towards deploying the model in the field" is mentioned, but its content is not provided. Therefore, I don't know the specific process followed for model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
