The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a variant of AlexNet. The text mentions that the proposed model, SIAlex, utilizes AlexNet as the backbone, which is a well-known CNN architecture. Additionally, the text discusses the use of convolutional layers and activation functions, which are typical components of CNNs. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
