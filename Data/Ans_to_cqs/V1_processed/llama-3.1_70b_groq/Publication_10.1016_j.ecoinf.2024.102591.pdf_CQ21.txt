Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to wildfire events, vegetation recovery, and remote sensing models (PROSPECT-D and 4SAIL), but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
