I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and mentions datasets such as Sparrow population dataset, Wolf dataset, and simulated datasets from Matthiopoulos et al. (2011) and Matthiopoulos et al. (2015), but it does not provide information about deep learning pipelines or the specific datasets mentioned in the query.
