Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the use of active learning for species identification and counting in camera trap images, but it does not provide information on where the data or pipeline is stored. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
