Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation measurements (RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2) for different machine learning models (ANFIS, ANN, and SVM) trained with the Best Training Subset (BTS) and the full dataset. It also discusses the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality data to select representative training data subsets. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training.
