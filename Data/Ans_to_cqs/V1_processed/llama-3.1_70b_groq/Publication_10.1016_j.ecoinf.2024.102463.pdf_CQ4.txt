I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning, model architecture, and the HyperBand algorithm for optimization. It discusses the importance of choosing appropriate hyperparameters, such as CNN window size and the number of filters, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
