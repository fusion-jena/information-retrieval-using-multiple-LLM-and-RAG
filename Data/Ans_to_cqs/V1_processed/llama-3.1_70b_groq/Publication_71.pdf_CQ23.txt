Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ and the challenges of incorporating a NIR band in addition to the RGB bands.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a large dataset, as the training number of steps is â‰¥100,000, which may indicate a substantial amount of data. Additionally, the use of a pre-trained model (deeplabv3_pascal_train_aug) and the option to fine-tune batch normalization (fine_tune_batch_norm) may suggest some form of transfer learning, which can help improve the model's generalizability.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is impossible to provide a more detailed answer to this question.
