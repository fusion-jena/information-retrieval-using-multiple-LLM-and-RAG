The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of different architectures. Specifically, it is a transformer-based network that incorporates a self-attention module and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is referred to as EMViT-Net. It uses the capabilities of CNN and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) module for the classification of environmental microorganisms.
