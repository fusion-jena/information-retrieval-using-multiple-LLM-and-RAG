The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the mean value of the ten results from the 10-fold cross-validation method is used to estimate the accuracy of the model. This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
