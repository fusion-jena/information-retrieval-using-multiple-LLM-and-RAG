I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. It does mention a few external sources and references, such as Semantic3d.net, which is a point cloud classification benchmark, but it does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline can be found.
