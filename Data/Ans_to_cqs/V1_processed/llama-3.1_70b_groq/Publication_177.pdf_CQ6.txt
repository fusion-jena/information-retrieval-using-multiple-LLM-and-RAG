Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It mentions that the selected network models were initialized with pre-trained ImageNet weights and then fine-tuned to the datasets, but it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been performed on the data.
