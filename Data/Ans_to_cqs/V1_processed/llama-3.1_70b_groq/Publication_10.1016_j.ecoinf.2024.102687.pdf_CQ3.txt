The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the labeling of data is often imprecise or lacks temporal localization details, and that recent ecoacoustic studies have introduced interactive visualization techniques to improve annotation.

Additionally, it mentions that a data-centric function has been used to automatically segment bird sounds in soundscape recordings, which can improve the quality of the recording dataset. This suggests that some form of audio segmentation or annotation may be used in the pipeline.

It also mentions the use of pseudo-labeling functions to build high-quality training datasets with minimum expert annotation effort. However, the specific techniques used for pseudo-labeling are not mentioned.

Overall, while the context provides some information on the challenges and limitations of data annotation in the pipeline, it does not provide detailed information on the specific techniques used.
