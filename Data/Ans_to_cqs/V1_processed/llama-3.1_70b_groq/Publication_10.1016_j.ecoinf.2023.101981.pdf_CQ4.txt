Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on the statistical analysis and model settings for detecting cow vocalizations, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
