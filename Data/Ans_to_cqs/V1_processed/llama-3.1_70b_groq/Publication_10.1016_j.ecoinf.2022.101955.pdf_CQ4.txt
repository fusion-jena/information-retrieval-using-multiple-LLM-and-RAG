Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on machine learning algorithms for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data, discussing various algorithms like kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF. It does not delve into the specifics of data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
