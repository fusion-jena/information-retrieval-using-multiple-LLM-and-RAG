The provided context mentions several hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. These include:

1. Number of epochs: The model was trained with 10 and 50 epochs, and the results were compared (Fig. 13).
2. Learning rate scheduler: The model was trained with and without a cosine learning rate scheduler (cos_lr) (Fig. 14).
3. Initial learning rate: The model was trained with initial learning rates of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 (Fig. 15).
4. Final learning rate: The model was trained with final learning rates of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 (Fig. 16).
5. Optimizer: The model was trained with RMSProp, SGD, and AdamW optimizers (Fig. 17).

These hyperparameters were varied to study their effect on the output metrics, such as precision, recall, mAP50, and mAP50-95.
