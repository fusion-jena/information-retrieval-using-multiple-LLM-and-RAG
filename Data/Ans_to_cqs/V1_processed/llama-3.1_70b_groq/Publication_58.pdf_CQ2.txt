The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically satellite images. The input data consists of 64 Ã— 64 windows used for labeling the central pixel, and the input channels include raw channels (Red, Green, Blue, and Near Infra-Red) as well as neo-channels (non-linear combinations of the raw channels) such as NDVI, MSAVI, MNDWI, L, c3, and ExG. Additionally, texture filters derived from arithmetic combinations of the raw image channels are also used. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
