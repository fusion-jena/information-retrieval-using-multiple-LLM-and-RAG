I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to research papers and articles on topics such as sustainable fishing, bycatch, machine learning, tropical tuna, and fisheries oceanography. However, it does not provide information on a specific deep learning model or its intended use.

Some of the papers mentioned in the context discuss the use of machine learning models, such as Random Forests, but they do not provide information on the purpose of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
