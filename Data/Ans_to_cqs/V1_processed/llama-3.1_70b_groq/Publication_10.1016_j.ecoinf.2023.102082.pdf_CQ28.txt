I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) to derive the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
