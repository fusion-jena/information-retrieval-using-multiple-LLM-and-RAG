I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in hydrological modeling, specifically in rainfall-runoff predictions, drought monitoring, and land use/land cover change detection. It discusses the architecture and functioning of ANNs, their integration with hydrological models, and their application in various studies. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
