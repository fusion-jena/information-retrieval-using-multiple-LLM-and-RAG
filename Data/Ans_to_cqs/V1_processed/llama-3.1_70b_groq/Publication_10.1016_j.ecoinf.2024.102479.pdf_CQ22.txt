Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) to tune hyperparameters and k-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of the models, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
