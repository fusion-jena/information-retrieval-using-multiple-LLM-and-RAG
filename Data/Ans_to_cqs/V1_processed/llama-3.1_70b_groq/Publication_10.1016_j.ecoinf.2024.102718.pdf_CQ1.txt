The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of two public datasets: the Plant Village dataset and the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset. These datasets are used for pre-training the network's weights and training the final model for diagnosing rice leaf diseases, respectively. 

It can be inferred that the datasets used in this study are likely collected through various means such as images of rice plants and leaves, possibly taken by researchers or farmers. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified in the provided context.
