I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be a research paper discussing the analysis of valve gaping data from sensors in the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea, and its potential applications in aquaculture and ecosystem management. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
