The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search. The context mentions that the grid search is performed over the following hyperparameters: C = {10−4; 10−3; 10−2; 10−1;1;10;100} and solver = {sag; saga; lbfgs}. This suggests that the model is trained with different combinations of these hyperparameters to find the optimal set that results in the best performance.
