The text does not mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather a model that calculates the relative importance of predictor variables based on the change in prediction error. However, it does mention that the importance score was calculated based on the median obtained from 30 repetitions. This suggests that some form of resampling or bootstrapping was used to evaluate the model's performance and increase the reliability of the results.

Additionally, the text does not mention the use of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other specific techniques to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, it does mention that the response curves of the most important predictor variables were plotted while keeping all other explanatory variables at their average values, which suggests that the model was evaluated under different scenarios.

It is also worth noting that the text mentions that the study area was divided into two regions with different climate conditions, which may have helped to increase the generalizability of the results. However, without more information, it is difficult to say for sure what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
