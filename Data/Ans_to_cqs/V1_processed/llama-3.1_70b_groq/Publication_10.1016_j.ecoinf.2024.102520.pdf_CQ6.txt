Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved in image processing before training a deep learning model are:

1. Geometric correction: This involves correcting the remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) to ensure that it is free from any geometric distortions.
2. Radiometric correction: This involves correcting the brightness values of the image data to ensure that they are consistent and accurate.
3. Image mosaicking: This involves combining multiple images into a single image to create a seamless and complete picture of the study area.
4. Cropping: This involves selecting a specific area of interest from the larger image and removing any unnecessary data.
5. Digital Number (DN) conversion to Surface Reflectance (SR): This involves converting the original image's DN values to SR values, which represent the actual reflectance of the Earth's surface.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis (SAGA) GIS to calculate topographic variables such as slope, aspect, drainage, and parent material from DEM data.

It is worth noting that the context does not explicitly mention normalization or scaling as part of the preprocessing steps. However, these steps are commonly used in deep learning model training to ensure that the data is on the same scale and to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
