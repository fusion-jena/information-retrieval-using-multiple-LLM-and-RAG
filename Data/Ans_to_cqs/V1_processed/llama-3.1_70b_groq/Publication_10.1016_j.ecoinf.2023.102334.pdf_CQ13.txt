Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions "learning and L2 regularization" in the context of the network's expressive power, but it does not provide further details on the hyperparameter settings.

However, the text does provide information on the experimental parameter settings in Table 1, which includes the machine configuration information, such as the central processing unit, memory, video card, operating system, CUDA, and data processing software. Additionally, the text mentions that the model was trained under the condition of unchanged training methods and parameters, but it does not specify what those parameters are.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
