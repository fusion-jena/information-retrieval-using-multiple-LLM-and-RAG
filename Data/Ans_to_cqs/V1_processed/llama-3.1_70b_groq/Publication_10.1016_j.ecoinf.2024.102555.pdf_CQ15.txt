Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to research papers on topics such as flood susceptibility mapping, dry-wet variations, burned area mapping, and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
