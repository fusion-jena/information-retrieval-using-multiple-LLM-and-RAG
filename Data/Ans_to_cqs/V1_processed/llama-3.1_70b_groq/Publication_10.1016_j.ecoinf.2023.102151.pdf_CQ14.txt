Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters of a model. The context appears to be related to soil science, irrigation, and ecology, with references to various research papers and techniques. However, it does not discuss machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not relevant to the provided context.
