The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

* Hidden activation function: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
* Optimizer: RMSprop
* Learning rate: 0.001

These hyperparameters were selected after performing a small grid search over a set of predefined hyperparameters, which included ReLU, sigmoid, and elu as activation functions, RMSprop and Adam as optimizers, and learning rates of 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001. The selected hyperparameters were chosen based on their performance on the training, validation, and testing datasets.
