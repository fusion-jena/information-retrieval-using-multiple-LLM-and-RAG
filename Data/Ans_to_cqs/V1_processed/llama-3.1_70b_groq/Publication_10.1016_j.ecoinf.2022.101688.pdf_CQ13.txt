Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the pre-processing hyperparameters for each dataset, including low pass filter cut off, downsampling rate, Nyquist rate, and segment duration. It also mentions the use of a pre-trained CNN feature extractor and the addition of a softmax output layer, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for training the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
