I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or any information about where it is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning models for water quality prediction, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
