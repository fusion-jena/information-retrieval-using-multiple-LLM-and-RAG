The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the text as "Training the CNN took approximately 18 h to complete the 6000 iterations." and also in the section "3.1. Model evaluation and selection" where it is mentioned that "The number of iterations for which the CNN was trained has a strong influence on its performances...".
