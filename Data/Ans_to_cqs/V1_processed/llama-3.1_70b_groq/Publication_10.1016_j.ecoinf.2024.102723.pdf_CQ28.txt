I don't know.

The provided context mentions that the Neural Networks were built from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras, and that TensorFlow is an open-source framework developed by Google. However, it does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context only discusses the implementation and architecture of the model, but not its deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
