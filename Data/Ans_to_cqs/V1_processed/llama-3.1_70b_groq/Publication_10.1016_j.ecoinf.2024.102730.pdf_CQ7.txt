According to the provided context, the data was split into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data). This split was done prior to conducting the grid search for hyperparameter optimization. The context does not mention a separate validation set, only a training set and a test set. The purpose of this split is to allow the models to be trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion, allowing for an assessment of their ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately.
