The provided context does not explicitly mention measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to improve the accuracy of the model. Data augmentation involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data. In this case, the context mentions two data augmentation techniques: (1) no augmentation, where the patches are only resized to 32 Ã— 32 and normalized, and (2) vertical and horizontal flip, where the patches are flipped vertically or horizontally with a probability of 0.5.

Additionally, the context suggests that including more examples in the dataset, obtained under different conditions such as different daylight conditions or different year seasons, could be a way to improve the accuracy of the model. This implies that the authors recognize the importance of having a diverse dataset for ensuring the generalizability of the model. However, it is not clear if any specific measures were taken to ensure that the dataset was diverse or representative of the population.
