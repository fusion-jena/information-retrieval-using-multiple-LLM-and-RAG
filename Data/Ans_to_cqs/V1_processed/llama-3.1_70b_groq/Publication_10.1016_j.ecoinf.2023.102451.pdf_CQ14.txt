Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameters used for training the EMViT-Net framework, such as the learning rate (0.002), batch size (32), number of epochs (100), optimizer (AdamW), and activation function (GELU). However, it does not provide information on the method used to optimize these hyperparameters, such as grid search, random search, or other methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
