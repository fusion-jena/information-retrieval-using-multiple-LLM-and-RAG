Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses various topics such as estimating forest biomass using LiDAR data, phytocoenological characteristics of Abies fargesii forests, and the importance of forest biomass density, but it does not provide information on model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
