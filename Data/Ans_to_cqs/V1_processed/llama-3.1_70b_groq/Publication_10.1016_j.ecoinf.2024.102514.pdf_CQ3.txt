I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a study on assessing water quality using machine learning approaches, and it discusses data splitting ratios, methodological frameworks, and performance evaluation of ML algorithms. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
