Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the performance evaluation of a random forest classification model for maturity condition in Chilean hake, using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and error. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
