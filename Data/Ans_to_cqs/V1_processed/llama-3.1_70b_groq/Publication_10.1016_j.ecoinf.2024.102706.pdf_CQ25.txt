The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is semantic segmentation, specifically for predicting forest canopy cover from satellite images. According to the text, "The application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation has also been investigated across various types of young vegetation cover (Cameron et al., 2022)." This suggests that the deep learning model is being used to segment images into different regions or classes, such as vegetation cover, in order to predict forest canopy cover.
