Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the authors evaluated the impact of the data split (i.e., test and training data ratio) on the final accuracy of wetland mapping. They utilized different ratios of training data from reference data, starting from 10% to 90%, increasing by 10%. This suggests that the authors may have used some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting to evaluate the model's performance.

Additionally, the authors mention that they used a pilot site, specifically Avalon, Grand Falls-Windsor, and Gros Morne National Park, to test their proposed end-to-end algorithm. This suggests that they may have used a diverse dataset to train and test their model. However, without further information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the authors' approach to evaluating their model, it does not provide a clear answer to the question of what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
