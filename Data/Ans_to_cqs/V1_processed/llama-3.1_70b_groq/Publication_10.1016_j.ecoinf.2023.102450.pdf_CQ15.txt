Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for animal tracking, species identification, and behavior analysis, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization methods employed. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
