Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and land cover classification, with references to various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF). However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and research question. Common practices include using a random split, stratified sampling, or k-fold cross-validation. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
