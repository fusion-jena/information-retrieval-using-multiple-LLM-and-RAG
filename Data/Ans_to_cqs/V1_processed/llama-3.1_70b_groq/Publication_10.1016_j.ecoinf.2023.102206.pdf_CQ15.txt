Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses the use of IFTL (Incremental Few-shot Transfer Learning) refinement over GRNN (Generalized Regression Neural Network) and SVR (Support Vector Regression), as well as other topics related to transfer learning, ecological informatics, and deep learning. However, it does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
