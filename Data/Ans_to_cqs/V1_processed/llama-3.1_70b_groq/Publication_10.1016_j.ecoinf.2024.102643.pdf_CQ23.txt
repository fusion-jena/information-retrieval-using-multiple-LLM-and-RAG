To ensure the generalizability of the models, the researchers used several measures. Firstly, they used an ensemble approach by combining the predictions of 10 different algorithms, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Maximum Entropy (MAXENT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), Classification Tree Analyses (CTA), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), and Surface Response Envelope (SRE). This ensemble approach helps to reduce the uncertainty among models and produces more robust results.

Secondly, the researchers used a weighted average of the predictions from three replicated runs for each model. This helps to reduce the variability in the predictions and increases the reliability of the results.

Thirdly, the researchers selected model runs with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) > 0.5 for generating the ensemble model. This ensures that only models with good discriminatory power are included in the ensemble.

Lastly, the researchers used a diverse dataset, which included various categories of protected areas, such as national parks, nature conservation areas, special environment protection areas, and wildlife enhancement areas, among others. This diverse dataset helps to ensure that the model is generalizable to different types of protected areas.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
