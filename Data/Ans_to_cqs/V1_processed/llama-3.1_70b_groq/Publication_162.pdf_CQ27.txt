Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning for fauna and flora recognition, various research papers, and the challenges of deploying a model in real-world conditions. It mentions the use of active learning to optimize the system and the importance of novelty detection, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

However, it does mention that the system will forward images to humans for annotation, which will be used to train a classifier iteratively. This suggests that the model is being continuously updated and improved, but the specific process of model deployment is not described.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
