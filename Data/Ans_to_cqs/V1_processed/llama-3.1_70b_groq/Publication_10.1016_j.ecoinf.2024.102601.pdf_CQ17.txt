Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on hyperparameter optimization for a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library. It discusses the tuning methodology, hyperparameter space, and evaluation metrics, but does not mention deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
