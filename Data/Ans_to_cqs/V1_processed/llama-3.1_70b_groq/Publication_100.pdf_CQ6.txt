The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is trained on a dataset of reference data patches of size 15 × 15 pixels, where a patch is only considered for training if the center pixel is forested. 

It also mentions that a pixel is considered forested if and only if it contains vegetation points (points with 𝐷𝑧 > 1.3 m) and also is considered forested based on NIBIO’s Norway-wide timber volume map. This suggests that some form of data filtering or cleaning is involved in preparing the dataset for training.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model is trained on a combination of optical and SAR images, but it does not provide information on how these images are preprocessed before being fed into the model. 

Therefore, while we can infer that some form of data filtering or cleaning is involved, we do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the question of what preprocessing steps are involved before training the deep learning model.
