To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the employed strategy is to generate an ensemble of three models. This approach is used to account for the variability in results that can arise from weight initialization and random selection for batch training. The ensemble consists of three models, two of which use max pooling and one that uses average pooling. The average of the final output layer from these three models is taken to produce the final result. This strategy helps to mitigate the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline and provides a more robust and reliable outcome.
