I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is hosted (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). The context appears to be a passage from a research paper or documentation about a landscape segmentation tool called LaDeco, which uses the MXNet framework and GluonCV library. It provides information on how to install the required libraries, load pre-trained models, and set thresholds, but it does not mention the code repository.
