Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting the percent disease incidence of CLCuD, but it does not provide details on the data splitting process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
