The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the CNN model, is to map a given query sequence to a vector of distances. This is used for distance-based placement of the query sequence onto a reference tree. The model is trained to predict distances between the query sequence and each taxon in the reference tree, and the final distances are used to determine the optimal placement of the query sequence on the tree. The model is not used for classification, segmentation, or detection, but rather for predicting distances and facilitating the placement of query sequences onto a reference tree.
