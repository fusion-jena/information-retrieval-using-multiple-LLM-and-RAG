The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Intersection over Union (IOU): This metric determines the proportion of intersection to union between the true labels and predicted values.
2. Mean IOU (MIoU): This metric computes IOU for each category separately and then averages the results across all categories.
3. Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA): This metric assesses the accuracy of pixel-level categorization by measuring the ratio of correctly categorized pixels to the total number of pixels.
4. Accuracy: This metric represents the proportion of accurately predicted data points from the whole dataset.
5. Precision: This metric ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better discrimination between negative samples.
6. Recall: This metric also ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better identification of positive samples.
7. F1 score: This metric, ranging from 0 to 1, reflects the model's robustness, with higher scores indicating better performance.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, including its ability to accurately categorize pixels, identify positive samples, and discriminate between negative samples.
