To monitor the model performance during training, several evaluation metrics are used. According to the provided context, the classification model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, Top-1 error, and Top-5 error. The formulas for these metrics are provided in the context, indicating that these metrics are used to assess the model's performance during training. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Inception Score (IS) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) values to compare the performance of different ACGAN models. These metrics suggest that the model's performance is monitored and evaluated using a combination of classification accuracy metrics and generative model evaluation metrics.
