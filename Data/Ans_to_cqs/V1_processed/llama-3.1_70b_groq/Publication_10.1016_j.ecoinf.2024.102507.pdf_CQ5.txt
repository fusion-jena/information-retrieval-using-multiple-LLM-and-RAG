The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the models pre-trained on vast datasets, such as ImageNet, can be repurposed and enhanced for tasks with limited data. This suggests that ImageNet might be one of the datasets used, but it is not explicitly stated as the primary dataset for the deep learning pipeline in this study. The context primarily focuses on the use of hyperspectral images with varying numbers of bands (e.g., 3, 4, 8, 36, 72) and the application of deep learning models like VGG19 and ResNet50 for image classification tasks.
