The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that five human labellers were used to separately annotate the sounds within the audio recordings, and conflicts were resolved using a majority rule. In cases where there was no majority, the authors used their own judgement on the most suitable classification.

It appears that the annotation technique used is a form of audio classification, where the labellers annotated the audio recordings to identify the presence of different sounds. However, the specific annotation technique used is not clearly stated.

It is worth noting that the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning, which are commonly used for image classification tasks that involve bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. However, in this case, the focus is on audio classification, and the annotation techniques used may be different from those used in image classification tasks.
