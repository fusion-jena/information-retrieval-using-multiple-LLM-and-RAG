Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text mentions the use of genetic optimization algorithms, artificial neural networks, SVM, and random forests for landslide susceptibility prediction, but it does not provide information on how the model was validated or whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

However, it does mention that the algorithm was capable of identifying the optimal ESA (Ecological Source Area) based on certain conditions, and that the entire optimization process was implemented in Python. But it does not provide enough information to determine whether the model was trained and validated on a diverse dataset or whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
