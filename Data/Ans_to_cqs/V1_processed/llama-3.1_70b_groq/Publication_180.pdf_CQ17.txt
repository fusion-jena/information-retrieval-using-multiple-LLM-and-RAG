Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of TensorFlow for deep learning research and applications, specifically for automated Chagas disease vector identification. It mentions adjusting two parameters from their default values: validation percentage and number of training steps. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
