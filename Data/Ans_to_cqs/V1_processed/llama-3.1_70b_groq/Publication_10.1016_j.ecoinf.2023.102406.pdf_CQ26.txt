The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some general concepts related to data preprocessing and modeling.

The context mentions "sample thinning" as a technique that was explored, but it was found to have little effect on accuracy or variable importance. It also mentions that reducing sample size requires lowering minimum sample size thresholds to maintain the same species pool.

Additionally, the context mentions "resampling" as a technique used for automated tuning of parameters in modeling packages. However, it does not provide further details on how resampling is used to address data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be said that sample thinning and resampling are mentioned as techniques used in the context, but their specific application to addressing data bias is not clear.
