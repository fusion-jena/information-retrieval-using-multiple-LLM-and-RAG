The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text primarily focuses on data preprocessing, fish species in the learning database, and some references to neural networks and deep learning. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
