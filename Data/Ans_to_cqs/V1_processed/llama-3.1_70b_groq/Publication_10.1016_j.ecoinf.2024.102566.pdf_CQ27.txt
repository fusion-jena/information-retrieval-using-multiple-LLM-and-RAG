I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of machine learning methods for developing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) models, the importance of high-quality training samples, and the integration of forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
