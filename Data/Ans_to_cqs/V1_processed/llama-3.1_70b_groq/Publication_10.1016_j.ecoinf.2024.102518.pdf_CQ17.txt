The text does not specifically mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a regularization multiplier in the context of tuning parameters for the MaxEnt model. The regularization multiplier is varied from 0.5 to 5 to determine the best tuning parameters, with a value of 3.5 being identified as optimal. This suggests that some form of regularization is being used to prevent overfitting, but the specific method is not specified as L2 regularization or dropout.
