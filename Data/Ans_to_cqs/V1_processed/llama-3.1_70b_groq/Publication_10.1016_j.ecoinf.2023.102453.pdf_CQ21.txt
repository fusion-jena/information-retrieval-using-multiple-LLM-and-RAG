The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that after a model has been trained, it needs to be validated and tested to confirm that it has achieved the desired performance. The performance might be measured using different metrics, such as classification metrics, but it does not provide further details on the specific postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
