The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include dropout. Specifically, it is mentioned that "a dropout" was used to reduce overfitting and imitate the training of a set of different models. However, there is no mention of L2 regularization being used in the context. 

It is also mentioned that early stopping was used with a patience equal to 5 to avoid overfitting. This is another regularization method used to prevent overfitting, but it is not explicitly listed as a regularization method in the query. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is that dropout is the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context.
