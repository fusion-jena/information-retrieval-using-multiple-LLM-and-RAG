The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). According to the provided context, the authors used a deep learning algorithm, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP), for modeling the relationship between Soil Organic Carbon Stock (SOCS) and environmental covariates. The MLP is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer.
