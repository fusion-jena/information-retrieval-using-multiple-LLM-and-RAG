The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs and then inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. This suggests that some form of manual tuning or trial-and-error approach was used, but the specific method of hyperparameter optimization (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
