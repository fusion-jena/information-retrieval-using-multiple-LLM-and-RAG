Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of a previously developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for acoustic detection of Northern Bobwhite covey calls, and the use of Audio Recording Units (ARUs) for data collection.

However, it can be inferred that the CNN model was trained on spectrogram data, which suggests that some form of preprocessing might have been involved in converting the audio recordings into spectrograms. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and I do not want to make any assumptions or provide potentially incorrect information. If you have any further questions or context, I would be happy to try and assist you.
