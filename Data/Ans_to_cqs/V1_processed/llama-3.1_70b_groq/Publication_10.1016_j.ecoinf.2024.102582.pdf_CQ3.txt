Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of random forest algorithm for land use classification and manual visual interpretation approach for correcting misclassifications between forest and mangroves.

In the context of land use classification, the text mentions that "Training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly extracted" using Google Earth Pro, and that "sample points were imported into the GEE application programming interface (API) for further analysis." This suggests that the data annotation technique used might be point-based annotation, where sample points are labeled with their corresponding land use classes.

However, it does not provide information on whether bounding box annotation or instance segmentation was used. In fact, the context does not mention object detection or instance segmentation at all. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of deep learning-based individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very-high-resolution satellite imagery, as referenced in the paper by Lassalle et al. (2022). However, this paper is not included in the provided context, and therefore, I cannot provide information on the data annotation techniques used in that specific study.
