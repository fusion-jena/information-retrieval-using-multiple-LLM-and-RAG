Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily compares XGBoost and deep learning models, discussing their differences in terms of model architecture, computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. However, it does not delve into the specifics of regularization methods used in deep learning.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
