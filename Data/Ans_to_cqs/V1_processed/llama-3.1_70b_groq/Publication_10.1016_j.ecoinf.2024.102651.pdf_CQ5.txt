Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the classification of microorganisms, Cervidae, and the use of YOLOv7 for object detection, but it does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
