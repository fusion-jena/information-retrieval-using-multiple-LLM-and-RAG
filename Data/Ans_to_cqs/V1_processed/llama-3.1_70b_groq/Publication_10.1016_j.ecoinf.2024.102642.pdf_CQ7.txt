Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the importance of multi-annotation campaigns, methods for assessing inter-annotator variability, and techniques for aggregating annotation sets. It also mentions the use of undersampling to balance the ratio of positive to negative sections in the training set for the blue whale's Dcall. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this study.
