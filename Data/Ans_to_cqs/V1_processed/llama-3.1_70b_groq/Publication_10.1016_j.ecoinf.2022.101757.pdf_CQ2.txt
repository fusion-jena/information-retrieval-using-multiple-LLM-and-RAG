Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. The context mentions the use of open image datasets, semantic segmentation or pixel-wise classification of photos, and the extraction of distances and metrics from images. Specifically, it mentions the use of LUCAS images, North looking images, and orthophotos. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, while CSV is mentioned as a format for storing data, it is not clear if it is used as an input format for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the answer is that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
