The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and Average Precision (AP). Precision and recall statistics are used with a bounding box marked as true positive if it had an intersection-over-union (IoU) of greater than 0.5. The Average Precision (AP) metric is used to compare the performance of different generalization approaches, which is the area under the precision-recall curve computed at 11 fixed 0.1 intervals between 0 and 1.
