The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to increase the number and variability of the training data.

According to the context, the following data augmentation techniques were applied to the original images:

* Rotation
* Horizontal flip
* Vertical flip
* Width shift range
* Height shift range
* Shear range
* Zoom range
* Brightness range

These techniques were used to modify the original images and generate new training data. However, it is not clear if any other preprocessing steps, such as normalization or scaling, were performed before training the model.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that data augmentation techniques were used, but it is not clear if any other preprocessing steps were involved.
