The hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are:

* For training the detection models: an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU (8GB GDDR6 memory) along with an Intel Core i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz (32GB DDR4-2666 memory).
* For evaluating the performance of the object detection models: an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU (11GB GDDR5X memory) along with an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2620 v2 @ 2.10GHz (16GB DDR3-1066 memory).

Note that there is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) being used for training the deep learning model.
