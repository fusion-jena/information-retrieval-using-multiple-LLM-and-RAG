I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a report discussing the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for bioacoustics research, specifically for classifying animal vocalizations. The text mentions various experiments, architectures, and results, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. If you are looking for the data repository link, you may want to check the original publication or contact the authors directly.
