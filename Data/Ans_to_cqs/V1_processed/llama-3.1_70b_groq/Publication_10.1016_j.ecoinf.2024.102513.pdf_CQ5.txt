Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that a neural network was trained using datasets, but it does not provide the names of the datasets. It only mentions that the training process was pivotal in developing a classifier capable of accurately identifying various land cover forms based on their spectral signatures.

However, it does mention that the datasets are related to satellite images and spectral channels, which suggests that the datasets may be specific to the field of remote sensing and land use/land cover (LULC) classification. But without more information, it is not possible to determine the exact datasets used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
