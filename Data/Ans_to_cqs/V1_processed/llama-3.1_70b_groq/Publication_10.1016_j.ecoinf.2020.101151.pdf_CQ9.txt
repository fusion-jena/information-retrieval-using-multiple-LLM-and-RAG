I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) for fire danger assessment in Austria, but it does not provide information on data repositories or deep learning pipelines.
