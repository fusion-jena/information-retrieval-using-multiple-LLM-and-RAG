Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning, to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters. It discusses the importance of considering factors such as sample distribution, atmospheric correction algorithms, and the creation of a representative dataset for model generalization.

However, it does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and extreme machine learning, for developing semi-empirical models. These models can potentially handle complex relationships between variables, but the context does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any further questions or would like to know more about the topics mentioned in the context, I'll be happy to help.
