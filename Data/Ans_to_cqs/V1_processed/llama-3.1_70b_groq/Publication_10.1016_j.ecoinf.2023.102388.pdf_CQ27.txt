Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, hyperparameters, and the issue of overfitting in deep learning models. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
