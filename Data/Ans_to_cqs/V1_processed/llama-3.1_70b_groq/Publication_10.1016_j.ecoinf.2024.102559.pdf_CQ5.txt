Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, land use and land cover classification, and invasive species detection, with references to various research papers and datasets related to these topics.

However, I can mention that the context does reference a dataset called "Santa Barbara County coast (2020)" from the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity, but it does not provide information on whether this dataset is used in a deep learning pipeline or what type of data it contains.

In summary, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
