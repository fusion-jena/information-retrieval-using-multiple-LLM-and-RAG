I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, random seed values, or strategies for handling randomness. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, data modeling, and metadata management for fish scale and otolith samples. It discusses data models, vocabularies, and metadata management, but does not touch on topics related to deep learning or randomness. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
