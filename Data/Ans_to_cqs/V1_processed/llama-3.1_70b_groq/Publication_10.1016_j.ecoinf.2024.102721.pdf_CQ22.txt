Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. It discusses the model's architecture, particularly the LSTM model, and its ability to learn in long time sequences, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used. It also mentions the use of SHAP values to analyze the contribution of features to the prediction, but it does not provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the overall performance of the model.
