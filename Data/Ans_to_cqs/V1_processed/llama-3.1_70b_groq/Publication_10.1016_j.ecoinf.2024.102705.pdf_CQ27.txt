Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the training process, evaluation metrics, and the architecture of the proposed model. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
