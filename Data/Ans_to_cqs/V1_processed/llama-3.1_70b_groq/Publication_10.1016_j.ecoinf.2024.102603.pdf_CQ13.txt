I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their architectures, and their performance on small datasets. It also mentions the use of XGBoost for Fv/Fm parameter estimation, but does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
