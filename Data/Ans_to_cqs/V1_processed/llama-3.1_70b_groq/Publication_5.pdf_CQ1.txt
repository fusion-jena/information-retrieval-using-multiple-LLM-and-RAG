The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to remote sensing data, LiDAR data, and satellite data, it can be inferred that some of the methods used for collecting raw data may include:

* Remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or aerial imagery
* LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors, which are used to collect high-resolution 3D data
* Drone-based sensors, as mentioned in reference 67, which uses drone image segmentation for mapping raised bog vegetation communities
* Public datasets, as mentioned in reference 68, which uses satellite and reanalysis data for predicting monthly Arctic sea ice concentrations

Additionally, the context mentions the use of TensorFlow, an open-source platform for deep learning, which suggests that the data may be collected from various sources and then processed and analyzed using deep learning techniques.

However, it is essential to note that the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, and the above-mentioned methods are only inferred based on the references to remote sensing and satellite data.
