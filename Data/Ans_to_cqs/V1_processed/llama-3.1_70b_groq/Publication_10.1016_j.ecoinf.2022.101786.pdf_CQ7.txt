The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets, and that the testing dataset was composed of 500 manually annotated images from the same transect. This suggests that the data was split into training, validation, and testing sets, but the specific criteria or proportions used for the split are not provided.
