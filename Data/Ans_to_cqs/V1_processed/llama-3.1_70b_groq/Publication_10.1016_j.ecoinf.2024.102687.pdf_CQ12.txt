The pipeline uses a combination of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and meta-learning algorithms. The CNNs used are pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and include ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet. These CNNs are used for feature extraction and are combined with meta-learning algorithms such as Matching Networks (MN), Prototypical Networks (PN), and Relation Networks (RN).
