Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, seagrass species, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about deep learning or regularization methods.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
