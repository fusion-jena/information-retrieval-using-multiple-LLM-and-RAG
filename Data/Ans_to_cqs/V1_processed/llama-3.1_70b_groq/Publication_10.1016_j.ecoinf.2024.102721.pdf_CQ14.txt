The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization (BO). According to the text, BO is a global optimization algorithm that optimizes the hyperparameters in ML models to achieve high simulation accuracy. It is based on the Bayesian theorem to estimate the posterior distribution of target functions and uses a probabilistic proxy model, specifically a Gaussian process, to estimate the prediction error of the model with various hyperparameters. This approach allows for efficient and effective optimization of hyperparameters, avoiding the need for manual tuning or exhaustive grid searches.
