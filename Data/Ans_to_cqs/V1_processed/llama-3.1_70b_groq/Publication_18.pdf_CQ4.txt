Data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include transformations that simulate the deformations that data could suffer in the real world. According to the provided context, some of the data augmentation techniques used are:

1. Scaling: This involves resizing the images to different scales to simulate how the same object may appear at different distances or sizes.
2. Rotations: This involves rotating the images to different angles to simulate how the same object may appear from different viewpoints.
3. Translations: This involves shifting the images to different positions to simulate how the same object may appear at different locations.
4. Different illumination conditions: This involves adjusting the brightness, contrast, or color balance of the images to simulate how the same object may appear under different lighting conditions.
5. Cropping parts of the image: This involves randomly cropping parts of the image to simulate how the same object may appear when partially occluded or when only a part of the object is visible.

Additionally, flipping (which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context but is a common data augmentation technique) involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images to simulate how the same object may appear when viewed from a different perspective.

These data augmentation techniques help increase the robustness and generalization capacity of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by artificially increasing the volume of the training dataset and simulating real-world variations in the data.
