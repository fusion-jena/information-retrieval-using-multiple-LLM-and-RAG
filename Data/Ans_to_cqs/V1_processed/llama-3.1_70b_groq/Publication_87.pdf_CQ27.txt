Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the training process using the `cnn_learner` function and the `fit_one_cycle` method, as well as saving the model after each epoch using the `SaveModelCallback` function.

However, it does mention that all trained models are available from a specific DOI (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164796), which suggests that the models were serialized and made available for download. But the exact process of model serialization and platform selection is not described in the provided context.

Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer, and I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
