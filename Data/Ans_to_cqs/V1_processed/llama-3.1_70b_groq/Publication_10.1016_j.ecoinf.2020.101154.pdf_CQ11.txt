I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a text discussing the hyperparameter tuning and modeling of GBRT (Gradient Boosting Regression Trees) for analyzing herring populations, but it does not provide any information about a data repository link.
