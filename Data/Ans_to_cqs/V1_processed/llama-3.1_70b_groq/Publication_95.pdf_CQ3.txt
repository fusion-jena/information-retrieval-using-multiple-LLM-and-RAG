The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "annotation size" and "annotation size relative to image size," which suggests that the annotations are related to the size or extent of the objects of interest within the images.

It can be inferred that the annotations might be bounding box annotations, as the context mentions the relative size of the annotations with respect to the image size. However, this is not explicitly stated, and other annotation techniques such as instance segmentation or semantic segmentation might also be possible.

Therefore, while bounding box annotation is a plausible possibility, the exact data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
