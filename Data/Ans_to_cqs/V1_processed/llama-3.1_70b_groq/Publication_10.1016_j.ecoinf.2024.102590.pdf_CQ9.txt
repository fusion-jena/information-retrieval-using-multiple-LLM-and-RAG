I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. In fact, the context mentions that the study used a supervised learning workflow with a Random Forest classifier, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline. It does mention that deep learning methods, such as CNN, may be useful for future analysis, but it does not provide information on the availability of a data repository for such a pipeline.
