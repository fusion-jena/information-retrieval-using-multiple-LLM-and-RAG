Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to the evaluation of datasets using the F-UJI tool and the creation of a report to visualize the scores. It does not provide information on model training or postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
