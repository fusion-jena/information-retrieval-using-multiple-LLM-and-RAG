The text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, but it does mention that the network processes "three-band (RGB) input images" with a size of 224 Ã— 224 pixels. This suggests that the primary data format used in the pipeline is image data, specifically RGB images. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
