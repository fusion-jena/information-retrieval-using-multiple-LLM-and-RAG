The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of various CNN architectures such as AlexNet and InceptionNet, which are used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the use of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, as well as the mention of activation functions like ReLU and Leaky ReLU, further supports the fact that CNNs are being used. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context, which are typically used for sequential data or natural language processing tasks.
