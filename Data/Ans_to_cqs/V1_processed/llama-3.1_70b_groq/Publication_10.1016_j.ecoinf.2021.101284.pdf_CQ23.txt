Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing data preprocessing and statistical analysis, but it does not mention deep learning models or any techniques to ensure their generalizability.

The context does mention that the data is of the Big Data type, with a volume in the order of terabytes, and that standardization was used to preprocess the data. However, it does not provide any information on how the data was split (e.g., cross-validation, stratified splitting) or whether the dataset was diverse.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
