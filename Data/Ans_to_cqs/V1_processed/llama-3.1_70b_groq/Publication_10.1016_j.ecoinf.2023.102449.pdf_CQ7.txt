Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the encoder and decoder, as well as the pre-processing and post-processing steps. It does not provide information on data splitting or the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
