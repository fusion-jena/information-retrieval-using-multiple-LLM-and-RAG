I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of machine learning for species identification, specifically for bats, and mentions the challenges of automated identification. It also mentions the use of Bayesian algorithms to improve the performance of software for bat identification. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
