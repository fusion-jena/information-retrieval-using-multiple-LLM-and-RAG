Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, statistical modeling, and penalized loss functions, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning models.

However, it does mention the use of cross-validation to obtain the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) or calculating it using a validation dataset that is independent of the training dataset. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of using separate datasets for training and validation, but the specific criteria for splitting the data are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
