Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, climate, and urban planning, but it does not provide information on the development or evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
