I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, mangrove forests, and land use/cover change analysis, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
