Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of pre-trained models (e.g., BirdNET, VGGish, Wav2Vec 2.0) for feature extraction and classification of animal vocalizations, and the potential benefits of training models on larger datasets of animal vocalizations.

However, it does mention that a recent study used self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently classify unlabeled data on 7 different datasets of vocalizing species, which provided results closely matching the observations and annotations of bioacoustics experts. This suggests that self-supervised learning techniques may be used to reduce the need for manual annotation of large datasets. Nevertheless, the specific annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context.
