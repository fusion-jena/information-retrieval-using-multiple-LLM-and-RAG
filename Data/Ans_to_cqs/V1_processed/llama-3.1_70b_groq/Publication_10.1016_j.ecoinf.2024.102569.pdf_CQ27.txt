I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be discussing the development of a model, including the use of a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty for variable selection and shrinkage estimation, as well as the use of the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) to select tuning parameters. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.
