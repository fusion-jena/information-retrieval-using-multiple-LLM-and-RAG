To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the technique used is maintaining consistent ratios across groups in the sampling process. According to Table 3, the data suggest that consistent ratios are maintained in the sampling process to avoid any potential bias during classification. This implies that the data is split in a way that preserves the proportion of different classes or groups in the dataset, which is a form of stratified splitting.

Additionally, the use of bootstrap sampling in the Random Forest classifier also helps to reduce bias. Bootstrap sampling creates multiple subsets of the training data for individual decision trees, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model.

There is no mention of oversampling or undersampling techniques being used to address data bias. Similarly, there is no explicit mention of diverse data collection as a technique used to address data bias. However, the fact that different samples are present across groups suggests that the dataset is diverse and representative of different classes or groups.

Overall, the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline are stratified splitting and bootstrap sampling.
