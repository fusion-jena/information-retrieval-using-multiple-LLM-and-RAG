The text does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that neural networks can be trained in a supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised way, and that various neural network architectures like UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) or DeepLabV3 (Chen et al., 2017) were developed for semantic image segmentation. 

UNet and DeepLabV3 are both convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, which are commonly used for image segmentation tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses a CNN-based model, but the specific type of CNN is not specified.
