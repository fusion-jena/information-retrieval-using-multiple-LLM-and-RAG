The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions the number of epochs (150) as one of the hyperparameters set empirically, but it does not specify whether the training process is stopped based on a validation loss plateau or any other criteria. Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
