Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the training and evaluation of various CNN architectures, including the comparison of their performance and the selection of the best architecture. It also mentions the use of transfer learning and the Adam and SGD optimizers, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including any model serialization or platform selection that may have been used.
