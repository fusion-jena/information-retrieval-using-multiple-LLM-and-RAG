Based on the provided context, one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. According to Table 3, which describes the CNN architecture, a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.4 is used after the third max-pooling layer. This suggests that dropout is used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in this specific CNN model.

However, there is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context. It is possible that L2 regularization is used in some of the pre-trained models mentioned, such as VGG16, ResNet-50, or Xception, but this information is not provided.

Additionally, data augmentation is mentioned as a technique used in the context of deep learning, but it is not explicitly stated as a regularization method. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, which can help prevent overfitting.

In summary, based on the provided context, dropout is the only regularization method explicitly mentioned as being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
