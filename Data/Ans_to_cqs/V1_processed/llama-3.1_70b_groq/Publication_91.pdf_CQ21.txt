Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context appears to be related to a research paper on using convolutional neural networks for pollen species identification, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used.

However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible postprocessing steps that might be involved after model training include:

* Metrics calculation: This could involve calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model.
* Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix might be used to visualize the performance of the model on different classes and identify areas where the model is making mistakes.
* Saliency maps: Saliency maps could be used to visualize the features that the model is using to make predictions and identify the most important features for each class.

However, without more information, it is impossible to know for sure what postprocessing steps were used in this specific case.
