According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data include:

1. Dedicated surveys: These surveys are conducted in a standardized manner and are specifically designed for collecting data. The context mentions that in-situ dedicated surveys were mostly conducted along predetermined routes, often following an equal coverage probability design.
2. Opportunistic in-situ surveys: These surveys are conducted as part of other research activities aimed at different scientific scopes. The context mentions that occurrence data also originate from opportunistic in-situ surveys.
3. Citizen science social media records: The context mentions that data included in SDM modelling also comes from large databases or citizen science social media records, although these data are typically collected in an unstandardized manner.
4. Large databases: The context mentions that data included in SDM modelling comes from large databases, although it does not specify the type of data or the methods used to collect it.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of sensors or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. However, it does mention the use of acoustic devices in dedicated acoustic surveys, as shown in Fig. 6D.
