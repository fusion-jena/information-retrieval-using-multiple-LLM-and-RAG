Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for animal identification in camera-trap images, the benefits of using deep learning, and the importance of large labeled datasets.

However, it does mention that the system uses "millions of labeled data from the SS project" and that the ImageNet dataset, which has 1.3 million labeled images for 1,000 categories, is used for transfer learning. This suggests that some form of labeling or annotation is used, but the specific techniques are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
