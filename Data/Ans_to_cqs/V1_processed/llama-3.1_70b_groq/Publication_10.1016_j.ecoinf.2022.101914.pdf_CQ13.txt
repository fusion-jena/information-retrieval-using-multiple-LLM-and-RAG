I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses ensemble models, Random Forest (RF), Generalized Linear Models (GLM), and MaxEnt, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
