I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the development and training of an artificial neural network (ANN) model, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and its application in ecological informatics. It discusses the model's architecture, training parameters, and performance evaluation, but does not provide information on the deployment platform.
