Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to Sentinel-2 data and synthetic aperture radar data, it can be inferred that the pipeline may involve the use of remote sensing data, possibly in the form of images.

Additionally, the mention of texture parameters and environmental variables such as carbon and soil pH suggests that the pipeline may also involve the use of tabular data, possibly in CSV format.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact data formats used in the pipeline. The context does not mention audio or video data formats, so it is unlikely that these are used in the pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the pipeline may involve the use of image data (e.g., Sentinel-2 data) and tabular data (e.g., CSV format), but the exact data formats used are not specified in the provided context.
