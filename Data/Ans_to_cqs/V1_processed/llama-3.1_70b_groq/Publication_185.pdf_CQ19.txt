The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it does mention that the model was trained using the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe (Jia et al., 2014). This suggests that Caffe is the framework used to build and train the deep learning model, specifically the AlexNet architecture.
