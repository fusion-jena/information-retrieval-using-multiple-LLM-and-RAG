I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research article on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated detection of humpback whale songs in a passive acoustic dataset. It discusses the architecture of the CNN, training library sizes, and inference times, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
