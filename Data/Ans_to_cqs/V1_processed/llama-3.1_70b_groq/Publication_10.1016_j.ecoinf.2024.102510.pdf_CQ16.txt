Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to focus on hyperparameter tuning, optimization algorithms, and performance evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used during training.

However, it does mention that the models are trained using the training dataset and saved as checkpoints for the specified hyperparameter values, and the models with the optimal hyperparameter values are evaluated using the validation dataset. This suggests that the training process may involve monitoring the model's performance on the validation dataset, but the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
