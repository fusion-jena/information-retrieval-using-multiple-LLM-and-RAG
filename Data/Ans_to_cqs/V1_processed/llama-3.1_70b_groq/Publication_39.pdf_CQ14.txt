The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that different settings of momentum and weight decay were checked but showed no improvements, and that the chosen parameters gave the best results in the evaluations. However, it does not provide information on the specific optimization method used, such as grid search or random search.
