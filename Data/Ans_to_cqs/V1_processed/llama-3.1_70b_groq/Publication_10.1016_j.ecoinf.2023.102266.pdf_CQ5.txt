I don't know. The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing a cellular automaton model for simulating environmental phenomena, such as wildfire spreads or pest plant propagation, and mentions the use of machine learning tools to improve the model. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the model.
