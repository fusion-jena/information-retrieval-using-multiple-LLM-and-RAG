I don't know. The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are used to identify local patterns in data, and the process of filtering and selecting redescriptions based on accuracy and other criteria. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods.
