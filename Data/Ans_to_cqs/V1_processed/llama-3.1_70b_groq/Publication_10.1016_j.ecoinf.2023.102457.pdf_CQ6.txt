Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily discusses the use of pre-trained models, such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, and their application in extracting embeddings for acoustic signal classification. It does not delve into the details of preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, that may be involved in training a deep learning model from scratch. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this context.
