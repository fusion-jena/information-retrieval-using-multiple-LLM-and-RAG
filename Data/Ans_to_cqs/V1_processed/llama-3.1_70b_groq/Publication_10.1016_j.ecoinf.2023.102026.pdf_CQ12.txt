None of the provided context mentions deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text only discusses traditional machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Generalised Linear Models (GLM), in the context of Species Distribution Modelling. Therefore, I don't know what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
