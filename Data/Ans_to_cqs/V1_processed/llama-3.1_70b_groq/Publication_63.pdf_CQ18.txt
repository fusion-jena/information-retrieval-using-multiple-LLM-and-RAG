The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation dataset. The remaining data after extracting a random sample of 10% for the test dataset was split into a 'training dataset' and a 'validation dataset' by a ratio of 4:1. The validation dataset was used to indicate the training progress after each full training cycle (epoch). The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the validation dataset was computed after each epoch. The model training was stopped when the validation MAE did not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverged from the training MAE, indicating overfitting.
