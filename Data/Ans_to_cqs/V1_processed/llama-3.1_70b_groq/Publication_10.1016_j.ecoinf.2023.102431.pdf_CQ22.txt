The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of linear discriminant analysis for species and sex discrimination. The context mentions the use of a stepwise variable selection procedure, F-ratios, and a logistic regression model to quantify uncertainty in classification. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.

The context does mention the use of a threshold value of 86.976 to classify individuals as fisher or marten, but it does not provide information on how the performance of the model is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, or other metrics. Therefore, I do not know what metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model.
