The text does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. In Table 7, the "Discrimination accuracy (%)" is reported for the Siamese Neural Network (SNN) and Ensemble MIA approaches. Additionally, the text mentions that the contrastive loss function is used to evaluate the loss and accuracy based on the prediction and ground truth. However, it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
