The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques that introduce randomness, such as:

1. Random scale: increases the scale of the image by a factor picked randomly in [1 to 10%]
2. Random crop: crops the image edges by a margin in [0 to 10%]
3. Flip horizontally: randomly mirrors the image from left to right.
4. Random brightness: multiplies the brightness of the image by a factor picked randomly in [0, 10].

These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and help the model generalize better to new, unseen data. However, the context does not provide information on how the randomness is controlled or if a random seed value is set to ensure reproducibility.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common strategy to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, as it allows for reproducibility of results. However, this information is not provided in the given context.
