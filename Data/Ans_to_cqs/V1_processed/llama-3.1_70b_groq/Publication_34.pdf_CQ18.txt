The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the performance metrics are calculated for each species and for two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites: a train set (4781 sites) and a test set (400 sites). This suggests that the model performance is evaluated on both the training and test sets, which is a common strategy to monitor overfitting and generalization capabilities of the model.
