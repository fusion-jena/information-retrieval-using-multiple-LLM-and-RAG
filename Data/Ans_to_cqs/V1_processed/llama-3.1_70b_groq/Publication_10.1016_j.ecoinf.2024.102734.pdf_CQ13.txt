Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models (e.g., learning rate, optimizer). It only mentions that "Model hyperparameters are implemented based on the recommendation outlined by the model authors." This suggests that the hyperparameters were chosen based on the recommendations of the original authors of the models (ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer, and HuBERT), but the specific values are not provided.
