Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and training process of the AODEGRU model, as well as its performance evaluation on a real-time dataset. It does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to optimize hyperparameters. These methods involve systematically searching through a range of possible hyperparameter values to find the combination that results in the best model performance.

Without further information, it is impossible to determine which hyperparameter optimization method was used in this specific case. If you have any additional context or information, I may be able to provide a more specific answer.
