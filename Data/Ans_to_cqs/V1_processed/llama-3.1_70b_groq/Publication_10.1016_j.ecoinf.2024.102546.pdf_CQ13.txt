The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models are listed in Table 2. The primary hyperparameter settings for the three detection models (YOLOX, YOLOv8, and I3Net) are as follows:

* Initial learning rate: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: 0.01
  - I3Net: 0.001 (initially), reinitialized to 0.01
* Learning rate schedule: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: Warm up + cosine decay
  - I3Net: Not specified in the table, but mentioned in the text as a different learning rate scheme
* NMS threshold: 
  - YOLOX: 0.45
  - YOLOv8: 0.7
* Confidence threshold: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: 0.25
* Weight decay: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: 0.0005
* Image size: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: 800
* Batch size: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: 8
* Optimizer: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
* Classification loss: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: BCE (Binary Cross-Entropy)
* Location loss: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: IoU (Intersection over Union)
* Data augmentation: 
  - YOLOX and YOLOv8: Color jitter + mosaic, VFL (Zhang et al., 2021), DFL (Li et al., 2020), and CIoU (Zheng et al., 2021)

Note that some hyperparameters may not be explicitly mentioned in the text or table, but these are the ones that are provided.
