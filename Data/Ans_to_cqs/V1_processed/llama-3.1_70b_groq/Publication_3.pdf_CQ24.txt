I don't know. The provided pieces of context do not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily discusses the performance of TensorFlow in classification challenges, the results of the challenges, and potential avenues for future development. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
