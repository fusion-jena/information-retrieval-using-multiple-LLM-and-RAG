The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that deep neural networks are frequently used for dimensionality reduction, and the input to a deep network often has many values, but layers typically get smaller throughout the network. This suggests that some form of dimensionality reduction or feature extraction may be involved in the preprocessing steps.

Additionally, the context mentions that a network can first be trained on a large dataset and then fine-tuned on the target dataset, which implies that some form of data preprocessing or normalization may be necessary to adapt the model to the new dataset.

However, specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given information.
