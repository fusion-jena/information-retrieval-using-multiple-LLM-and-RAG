The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved converting the saved models into the TensorFlow Lite version using the TensorFlow Lite converter. This conversion allowed the models to be used for deep learning on smartphone and IoT devices. The TensorFlow Lite models were then integrated into a mobile app developed using Android Studio and the Java programming language. The app's architecture included a leaf detection module that contained a TensorFlow Lite interpreter for the TensorFlow Lite model. The app could be tested using Android Studio's built-in phone emulators or deployed to an actual device.
