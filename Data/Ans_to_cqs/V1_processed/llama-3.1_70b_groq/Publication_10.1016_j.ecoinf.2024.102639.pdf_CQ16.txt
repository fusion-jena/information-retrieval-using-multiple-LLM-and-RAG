The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention the use of cross-validation to refine hyperparameters and evaluate model performance. Specifically, it mentions that the selection of the distance metric and the number of principal components were dictated by the explained variance ratio, and that the SVM model was trained on the dimensionally reduced dataset with hyperparameters refined through a synergistic application of grid search and cross-validation. 

It can be inferred that the training process may involve monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping the training when the performance plateaus or reaches a satisfactory level. However, the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified in the provided context.
