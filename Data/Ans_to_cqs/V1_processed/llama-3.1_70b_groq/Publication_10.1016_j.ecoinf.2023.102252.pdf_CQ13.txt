I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to a model called FERM, which is described in a research paper, but it does not provide information about deep learning or its hyperparameters. The tables and text provided discuss the parameters of the FERM model, but they do not mention learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters typically associated with deep learning.
