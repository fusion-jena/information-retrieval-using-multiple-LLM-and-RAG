Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bootstrap Forest, and Boosted Tree, for predicting different variables like bark thickness, hypericin content, and pest occurrence. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization techniques used, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
