The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data is collected from videos, as the context mentions extracting frames from videos and using them to train and test CNN models.

One of the papers mentioned, "Role of digital technology in freshwater biodiversity monitoring through citizen science during covid-19 pandemic" by Dwivedi, suggests that citizen science and digital technology can be used for collecting data on freshwater biodiversity. However, it is not clear if this is related to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.

Another paper, "Deep fusion of appearance and frame differencing for motion segmentation" by Ellenfeld et al., mentions using frame differencing and scanlines for motion segmentation, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

The context also mentions the use of the ImageNet database, which is a large-scale hierarchical image database. However, it is not clear if this database is used as a source of raw data for the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the query, and it is not possible to determine the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
