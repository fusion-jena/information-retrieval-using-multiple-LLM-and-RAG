Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It mentions various models such as ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
