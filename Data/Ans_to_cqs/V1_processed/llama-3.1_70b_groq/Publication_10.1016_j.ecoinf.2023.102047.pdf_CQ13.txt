Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context primarily discusses various deep learning models and their performance on seagrass meadow detection tasks, as well as some technical details about fusion methods and compound scaling. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
