Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on audio frontend techniques, such as learnable frontends, compression, and normalization methods, specifically in the context of species recognition from outdoor recordings.

It does not discuss data bias, stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a relevant answer to this query.

However, I can suggest that the context implies that the use of learnable frontends, such as LEAF-P and SincNet-P, and techniques like PCEN (Per-Channel Energy Normalization) may help alleviate stationary background noise, which could be a form of data bias. Nevertheless, this is not directly related to the query, and I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer.
