Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It mentions that the models were pre-initialized to ImageNet weights and that the feature extraction layers were initially frozen, but later both feature extraction and classifier layers were made trainable. However, it does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the data.

It does mention that the data is highly unbalanced and suggests using techniques like SMOTE to balance the data, but it does not provide information on whether any preprocessing steps were taken before training the models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
