The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training subset of the PST dataset is used for the supervised learning step concerning PCÎ¸, and the overall counting pipeline is evaluated on the test split. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using a separate test set, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor performance during training are not mentioned.
