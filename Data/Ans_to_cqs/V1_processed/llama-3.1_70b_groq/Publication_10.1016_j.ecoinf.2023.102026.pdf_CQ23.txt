Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and mentions various methods such as generalized linear models, random forests, and bootstrapping, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning models or their generalizability.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
