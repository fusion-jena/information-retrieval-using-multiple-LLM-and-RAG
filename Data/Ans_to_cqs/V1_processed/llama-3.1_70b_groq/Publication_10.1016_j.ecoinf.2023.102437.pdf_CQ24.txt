Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, in environmental science and climate-related tasks. It also mentions the use of random forest (RF) models and Lasso models for tasks like ENSO forecasting.

However, it does mention the concept of "ensemble learning" in the context of RF models, which involves aggregating the predictions of multiple tree structures or models to improve overall performance. This can be seen as a way to handle randomness or variability in the data, but it is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
