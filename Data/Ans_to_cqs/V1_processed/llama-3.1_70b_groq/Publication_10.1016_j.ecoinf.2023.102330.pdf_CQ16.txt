The criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the empirical models used an adaptive phase of 2000 iterations and sampled from posterior distributions using three Markov chains each of length 20,000 to ensure convergence. Additionally, a burn-in period of 5000 was applied. This suggests that the training process is considered complete when the Markov chains have converged, but the specific criteria used to determine convergence (e.g., validation loss plateau) are not specified.
