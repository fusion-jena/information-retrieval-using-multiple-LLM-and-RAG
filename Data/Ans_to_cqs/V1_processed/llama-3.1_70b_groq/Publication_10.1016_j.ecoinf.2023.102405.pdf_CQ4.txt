Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on data pre-processing, specifically data cleansing, and the training process of an AODEGRU model. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
