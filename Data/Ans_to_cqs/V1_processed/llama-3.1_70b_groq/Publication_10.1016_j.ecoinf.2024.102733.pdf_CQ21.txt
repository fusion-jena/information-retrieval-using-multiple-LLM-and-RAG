Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including the determination of trajectory length, data preprocessing, and the training of the diffusion model and the MLP. It also discusses the importance of the starting point of the reverse process and the use of SMOTE for improved performance. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that occur after the model training is complete.
