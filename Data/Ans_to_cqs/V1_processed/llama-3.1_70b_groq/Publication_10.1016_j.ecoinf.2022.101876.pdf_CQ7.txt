Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the process of training and testing a computer vision model, but it does not provide specific details on how the data is split into training, test, and validation sets.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training is complete.

Typically, the data is split randomly, with a common ratio being 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. However, this ratio can vary depending on the specific problem and the size of the dataset.

In the context of the provided text, it is likely that the authors followed a similar approach, but without explicit information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
