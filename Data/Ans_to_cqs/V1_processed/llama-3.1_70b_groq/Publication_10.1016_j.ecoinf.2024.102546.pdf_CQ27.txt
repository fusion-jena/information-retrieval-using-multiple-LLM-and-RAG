Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, data augmentation, and hyperparameter settings for the models. It also discusses the issue of data distribution shifts and the importance of domain generalization in crop and weed segmentation.

However, it does mention that the models were trained for 40 epochs with a batch size of 8, and the images were resized to 800 Ã— 800 pixels to be compatible with the model architectures and training efficiency. But it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
