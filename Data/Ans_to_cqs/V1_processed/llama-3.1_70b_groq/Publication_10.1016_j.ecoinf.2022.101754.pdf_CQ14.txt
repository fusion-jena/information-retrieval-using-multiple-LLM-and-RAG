The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, but it does mention that "Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done for each set." This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
