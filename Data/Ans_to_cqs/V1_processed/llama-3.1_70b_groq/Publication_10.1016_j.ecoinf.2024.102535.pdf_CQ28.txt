I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the evaluation of six state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for deep-sea substratum characterization, the use of a classification decision committee, and the challenges of limited labeled data for training DL models. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
