The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically YAMNet, is classification. It is used to map the extracted embeddings to the available labels, which are the classes of goat vocalizations. The model is pre-trained on a large dataset (AudioSet-YouTube corpus) with 521 classes and is fine-tuned to recognize the specific audio structure of goat vocalizations. The output of the YAMNet model is then fed into a sequential and reduce mean layer to produce the final classification result.
