Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and recognition tasks, and the use of pre-trained networks like VGGnet. It also mentions the fine-tuning of the network weights using the Benthoz15 dataset, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during the fine-tuning process.
