I don't know. The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on geographical and environmental studies, specifically discussing vegetation indices, geographical detectors, and climate variables. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods.
