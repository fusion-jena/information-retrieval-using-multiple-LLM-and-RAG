The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data is derived from "open and citizen science projects" and specifically from the "iNaturalist plant photograph database". This suggests that the raw data is collected through citizen science efforts, where individuals contribute photographs of plants, which are then used to train the deep learning models. Additionally, it is mentioned that bioclimatic data from Worldclim is used as a contextual constraint, but it is not clear how this data is collected.
