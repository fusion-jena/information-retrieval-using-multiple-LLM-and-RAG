Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text primarily discusses the use of deep learning tools for urban ecoacoustic assessment, the limitations of traditional methods, and the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for large-scale ecological community assessments. However, it does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.
