Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The text primarily focuses on the challenges of bird detection in camera trap datasets, the construction of a wild bird dataset, and the evaluation of various deep learning methods for bird identification. It discusses the impact of dataset noise, environmental clutter, and model frameworks on model accuracy but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
