Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, Sentinel-2 data, and feature selection using Support Vector Machines (SVM), but it does not discuss data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
