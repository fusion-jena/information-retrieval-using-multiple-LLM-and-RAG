Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the architecture of a neural network, the output sizes, and the number of parameters, as well as an experiment on hand-crafted feature extraction. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
