Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the selection of the distance metric, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning for the SVM model. It also delves into the analytical solution of the decision-making model and provides a literature review. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
