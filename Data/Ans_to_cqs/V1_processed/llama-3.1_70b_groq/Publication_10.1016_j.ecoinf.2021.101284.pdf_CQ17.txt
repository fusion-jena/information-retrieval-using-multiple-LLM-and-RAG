Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on various research studies and papers related to COVID-19, air pollution, and data analysis, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning techniques or regularization methods.

However, it is worth noting that one of the papers mentioned, "Early diagnosis of covid-19-affected patients based on x-ray and computed tomography images using deep learning algorithm" by Castillo (2020), may potentially discuss regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline, but this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
