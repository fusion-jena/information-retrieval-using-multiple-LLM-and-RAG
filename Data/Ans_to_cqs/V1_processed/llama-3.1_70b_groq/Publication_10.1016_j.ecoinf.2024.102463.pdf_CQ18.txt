The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is based on the Hyperband algorithm, which involves a combination of partial training, successive halving, and repeated evaluation. 

During the training process, the model's performance is evaluated using two metrics: the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) score. The MAE measures the average difference between predicted and actual values, while the NSE score measures the model's ability to predict the variability in the data.

The Hyperband algorithm iteratively trains and evaluates the model on a subset of the data, eliminating underperforming configurations and promoting the best-performing ones to the next stage. This process is repeated until only one configuration remains, which is then considered the best configuration found.

Additionally, the role of training base and test base is swapped to determine the most suitable database to be used as the training base. This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and helps to identify the optimal training base and its size.
