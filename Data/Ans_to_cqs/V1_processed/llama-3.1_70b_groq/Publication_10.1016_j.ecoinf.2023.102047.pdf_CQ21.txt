Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context only discusses the methodology for H. ovalis detection, including dataset description, dataset processing and labeling, model training, and performance evaluation, but it does not provide details on the specific postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention that the performance evaluation is one of the steps in the methodology, but it does not elaborate on what specific metrics or techniques are used for evaluation.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
