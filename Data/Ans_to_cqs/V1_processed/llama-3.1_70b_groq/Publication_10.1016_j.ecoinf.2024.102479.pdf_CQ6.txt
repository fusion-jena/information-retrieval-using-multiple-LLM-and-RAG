Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning algorithms, including random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, using techniques such as Grid Search Cross Validation (GSCV). 

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial before training a deep learning model. Normalization typically involves scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data.

Since the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
