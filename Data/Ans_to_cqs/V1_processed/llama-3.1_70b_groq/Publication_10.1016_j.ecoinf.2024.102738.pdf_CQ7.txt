The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the sampling size and validation areas for the Random Forest classification model.

According to the text, the authors relied on Chuvieco (2020) and Congalton (1991) for sampling size guidelines. They considered at least 196 test points for categorical variables, but also explored alternative strategies. They decided to include pure training areas with at least 50 pixels in total, representing each thematic class, and used simplified random sampling to capture variability within each class.

There is no mention of deep learning model training or the specific criteria used to split the data for such a model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
