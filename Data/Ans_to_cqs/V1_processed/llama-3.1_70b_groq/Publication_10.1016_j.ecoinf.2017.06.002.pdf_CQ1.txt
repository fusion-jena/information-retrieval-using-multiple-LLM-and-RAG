Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to data management and metadata templates for environmental or ecological research, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning pipelines or methods for collecting raw data.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that sensors are used for collecting data, as mentioned in the "Equipment" section, which lists "instruments (sensors & loggers)" and provides details such as Sensor_ID, model, type, and manual. Additionally, the context mentions "sample-based data" and "data files," which suggests that data may be collected through field measurements or experiments.

But, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.
