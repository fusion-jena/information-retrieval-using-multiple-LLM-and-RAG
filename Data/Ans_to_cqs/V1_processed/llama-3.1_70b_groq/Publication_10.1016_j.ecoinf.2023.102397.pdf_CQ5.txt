Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, acoustic data analysis, and bird song recognition, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
