The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context is based on the distribution of approximately 20%, 60%, and 20% for test, train, and validation sets, respectively. Specifically, the dataset was split into 388 patches for the test set, 1162 patches for the training set, and 388 patches for the validation set.
