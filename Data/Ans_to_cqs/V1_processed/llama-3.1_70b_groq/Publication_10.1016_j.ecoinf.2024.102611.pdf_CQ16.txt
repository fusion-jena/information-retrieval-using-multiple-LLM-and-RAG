Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the data collection, distribution, and evaluation of the hierarchical classification model using a Random Forest classifier. It discusses the training, validation, and testing strategies, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training.

However, it does mention that the model's hyperparameters are fine-tuned using both validation and test sets to achieve generalizability and scalability towards unseen datasets. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set may be used as a criterion to determine when training is complete, but the specific criteria used are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau.
