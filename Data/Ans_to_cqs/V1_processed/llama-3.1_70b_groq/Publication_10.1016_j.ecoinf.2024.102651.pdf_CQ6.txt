Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the proposed CA-Hybrid network, which combines CNN and ViT modules for Cervidae classification. It discusses the network's structure, the integration of CAM into the residual structure of ResNet, and the comparison of its performance with other networks.

However, it does mention that the network is used to classify objects localized by YOLOv7, which implies that some form of object detection and localization is performed before classification. But it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
