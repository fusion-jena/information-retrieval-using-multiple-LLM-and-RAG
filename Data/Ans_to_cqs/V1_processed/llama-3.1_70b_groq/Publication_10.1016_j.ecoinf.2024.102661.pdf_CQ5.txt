I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, for forecasting agricultural carbon emissions in China. The context also mentions the Tree-structured Parzen estimator Bayesian optimization (TPEBO) algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in the pipeline.
