I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the development of a hybrid deep neural network called BivalveNet for geographical traceability of bivalve shells based on shell image analysis, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.
