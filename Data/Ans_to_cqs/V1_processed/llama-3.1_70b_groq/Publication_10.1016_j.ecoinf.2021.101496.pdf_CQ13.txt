I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that the artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed empirically, with two input nodes and one output node, and that 100 successful runs were performed to evaluate the model's performance. However, it does not provide any information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
