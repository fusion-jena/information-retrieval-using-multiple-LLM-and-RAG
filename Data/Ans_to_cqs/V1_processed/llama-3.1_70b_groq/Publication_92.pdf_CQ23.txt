The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a database consisting of couples (Ii, li) with Ii being the image i and li being its label, where li is the fish species. This suggests that the model was trained on a dataset with multiple classes (fish species), which could contribute to its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's architecture follows GoogLeNet's with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. This architecture is known for its ability to learn robust features from large datasets, which could also contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. It is also not clear whether the dataset used to train the model was diverse and representative of the problem domain.

Therefore, while the context provides some information about the model's architecture and training data, it does not provide a complete picture of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
