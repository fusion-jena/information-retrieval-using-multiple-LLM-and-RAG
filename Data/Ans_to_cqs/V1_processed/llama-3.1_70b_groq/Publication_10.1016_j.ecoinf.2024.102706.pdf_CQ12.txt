Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) are mentioned in the text as being used for semantic segmentation in the context of young vegetation cover. However, it is not explicitly stated that DCNN is used in the pipeline for this particular study. The study primarily focuses on traditional machine learning models such as RF, SVM, XGboost, and LightGBM, as well as linear and Enet models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to confirm the use of a specific deep learning model in the pipeline.
