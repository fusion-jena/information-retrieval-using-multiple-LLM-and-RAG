Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, digital image processing, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the pipeline, as there are references to remote sensing, digital image processing, and image classification. But the specific data formats (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, PNG) are not mentioned.

Additionally, there is a mention of Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery, which suggests that satellite image data is used in the pipeline. But again, the specific data formats are not specified.

Therefore, while it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the pipeline, the specific data formats used are not mentioned in the provided context.
