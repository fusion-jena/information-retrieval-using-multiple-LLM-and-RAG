Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on various topics such as fisheries, marine ecology, and machine learning algorithms like SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, and Na√Øve Bayes. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
