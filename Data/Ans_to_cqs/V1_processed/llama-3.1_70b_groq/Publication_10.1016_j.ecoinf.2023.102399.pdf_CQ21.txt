Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on the performance evaluation of different models (YOLOv5n and DL-YOLO) for fish weight estimation, including metrics such as RMSE, MRE, and R2. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
