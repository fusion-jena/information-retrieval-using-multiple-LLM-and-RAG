The text does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). However, based on the models mentioned in section 2.3, such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and DenseNet, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These models are all types of CNNs, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
