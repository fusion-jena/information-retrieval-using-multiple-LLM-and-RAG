Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the HyperBand algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, but it does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters being optimized.

However, it does mention that the model involves a large number of hyperparameters related to different types of layers (convolutional or recurrent), and that the number of convolution layers is lower than that given in the article, with two convolution layers. The size and associated max-pooling of these layers will be determined in a specified interval.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model has a structure similar to the one present in the encoder, but it does not provide further details on the specific hyperparameters used in the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
