The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that "the vast majority of studies report precision indicators," which suggests that precision is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, the context mentions that the study aims to address the lack of interpretability of the predictions, which implies that the study may be using metrics beyond just precision indicators. However, the specific metrics used are not mentioned.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that 70% of the data was used for training the algorithms and the remaining 30% was used for validation, which suggests that the study may be using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set. However, without explicit mention of these metrics, it is difficult to say for certain.
