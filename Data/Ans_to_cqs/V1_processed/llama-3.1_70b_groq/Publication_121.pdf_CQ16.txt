The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the models were trained within 10 and 100 epochs (iterations). This suggests that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being based on a specific criteria such as validation loss plateau.
