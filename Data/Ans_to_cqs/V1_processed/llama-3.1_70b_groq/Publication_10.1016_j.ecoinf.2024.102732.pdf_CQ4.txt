Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context appears to focus on machine learning methods, particularly Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), for predicting Aboveground Biomass (AGB) using remote sensing data. It discusses the suitability of SVR for making predictions with restricted datasets and highlights the importance of integrating spectral bands with other variable sets for more favorable outcomes.

However, it does not delve into deep learning pipelines or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
