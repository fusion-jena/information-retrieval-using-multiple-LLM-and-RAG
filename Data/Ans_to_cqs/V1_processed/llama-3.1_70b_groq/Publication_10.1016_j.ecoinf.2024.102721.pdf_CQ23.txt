Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a snippet from a research article, and it discusses various aspects of the study, such as the use of SHAP values for feature importance, scenario analysis of oasis NDVI, and model interpretability analysis. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context. If you have access to the full article or more information, you may be able to find the answer to this question.
