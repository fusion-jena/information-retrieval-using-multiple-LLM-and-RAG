Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the concept of embeddings, and the use of dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE. It also mentions specific models like BirdNET and SincNet, but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
