The provided context suggests that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. This is evident from the various papers and research studies mentioned, which focus on image recognition, object detection, and segmentation in the context of agricultural automation and pest management.

For instance, the paper by Wang et al. (2020) introduces a large-scale dataset of agricultural pests, Pest24, which consists of images of pests. Similarly, the study by Wang et al. (2021) uses an improved YOLOv4 deep learning network for detecting whiteflies and thrips on sticky trap images.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net and Faster R-CNN, which are commonly used for image processing and analysis tasks. The mention of image preprocessing techniques, such as cropping, flipping, and patching, further supports the use of image data formats in the deep learning pipeline.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. While CSV (Comma Separated Values) files may be used for storing and processing metadata or annotations related to the images, there is no indication that CSV files are used as a primary data format in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats.
