Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It does not mention the use of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the diversity of the dataset. The context only mentions that the model was trained on a dataset and achieved an accuracy of 95.06% on 140 epochs, but it does not provide information on how the dataset was split or whether any techniques were used to ensure the model's generalizability.
