Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on the use of GPUs for machine learning and deep learning applications, particularly in ecology, and mentions various software tools and programming languages used for these applications.

However, it does mention that typical machine learning applications involved recognition and classification of visual images (e.g., Atila et al., 2021) or acoustic recordings (e.g., Nanni et al., 2020), but it does not specify the datasets used in these applications.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
