The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that satellite images for sites #1, #3, #5, #7-10 were used for training, and #2, #4, #6 were used for validation. 

It appears that the data was split based on the site numbers, but the specific criteria or reasoning behind this split is not provided. There is no mention of a test set, but it is possible that the assessment performed on sub-images generated from image #2 (Table 1) could be considered as a test or evaluation of the model's performance.
