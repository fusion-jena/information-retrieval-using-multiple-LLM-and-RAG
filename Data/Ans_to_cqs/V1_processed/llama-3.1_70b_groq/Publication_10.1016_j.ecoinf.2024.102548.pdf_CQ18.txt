The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of accuracy and loss metrics. The context mentions that the evaluation of model performance was based on the accuracy metric, and the training and validation accuracy and loss were plotted against epochs (Fig. 6, 7, 8, and 9). This suggests that the model performance was monitored by tracking the accuracy and loss on both the training and validation sets during the training process. Additionally, the context mentions that the models underwent training for 10 epochs, which implies that the performance was monitored over multiple iterations of training.
