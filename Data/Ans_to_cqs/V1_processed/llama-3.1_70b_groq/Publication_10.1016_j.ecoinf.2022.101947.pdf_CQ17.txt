Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Amur tigers and leopards, and the text discusses topics such as holdback partitioning trials, test and training set sizes, and algorithm validation. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
