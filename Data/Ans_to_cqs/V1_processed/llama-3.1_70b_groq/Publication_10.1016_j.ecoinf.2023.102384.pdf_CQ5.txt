Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few datasets related to agricultural pests, such as Pest24, which is a large-scale dataset of agricultural pests for multi-target detection.

Additionally, some papers mention using sticky trap images for detecting whiteflies and thrips, but they do not specify the name of the dataset.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the question about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
