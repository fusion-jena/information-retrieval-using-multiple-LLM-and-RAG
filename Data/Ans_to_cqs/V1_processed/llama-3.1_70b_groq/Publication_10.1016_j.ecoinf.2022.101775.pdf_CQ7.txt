The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "We trained algorithms with the amount of data available after manually removing the testing set, as described above. During the training, 10% of data served as the validation set to check for overfitting."

This suggests that the data was split into three sets: a training set, a testing set, and a validation set. The testing set was removed from the data before training, and 10% of the remaining data was used as the validation set. The remaining data was used for training.

However, the exact criteria used to split the data into these sets, such as the proportion of data used for each set or the method used to select the data for each set, are not specified in the provided context.
