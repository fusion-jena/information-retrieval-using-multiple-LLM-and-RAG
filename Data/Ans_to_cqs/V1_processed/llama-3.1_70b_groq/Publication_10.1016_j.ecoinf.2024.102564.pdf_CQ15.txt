The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention the training algorithms used for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which are resilient propagation (Rprop) and scaled conjugate gradient (SCG). These algorithms are used to optimize the weights of the ANN during training. 

It's worth noting that the context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning techniques, but rather focuses on traditional machine learning methods such as ANNs, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests. Therefore, the optimization techniques mentioned are specific to the training of ANNs and not necessarily applicable to a deep learning pipeline.
