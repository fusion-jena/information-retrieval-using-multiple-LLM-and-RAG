I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to environmental science, drought monitoring, and soil salinity, but it does not provide information on the implementation of a specific model or its training process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
