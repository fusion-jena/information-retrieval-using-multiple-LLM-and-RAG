The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a hybrid CNN-LSTM (C-L) model. This model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the processing power and robustness of the model. The CNN is used to extract features from the data, while the LSTM is used to model the temporal dynamics of the drought propagation time series.
