Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The text mentions various datasets, such as the VisDrone dataset, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID, which are described as containing images. Additionally, the text discusses data augmentation techniques, such as HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, and mosaicking, which are typically applied to image data.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is also not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats.
