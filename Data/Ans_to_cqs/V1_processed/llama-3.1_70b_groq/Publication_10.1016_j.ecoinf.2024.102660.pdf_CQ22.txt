According to the provided context, the study employed five metrics to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, namely:

1. Accuracy (A)
2. Precision (P)
3. Recall (R)
4. F1-score (F1)
5. Intersection over Union (IOU)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, specifically the Res_AUNet network, for water sun glint detection in UAV water images.
