Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the acquisition and preprocessing of GF-6 remote sensing data, the implementation of CART and Random Forest regression models, and the fine-tuning of model parameters. It does not discuss techniques for addressing data bias, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of techniques to prevent overfitting, such as fine-tuning model parameters like 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes' in the CART model, and 'n_estimators' in the Random Forest regression model. But these techniques are not directly related to addressing data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
