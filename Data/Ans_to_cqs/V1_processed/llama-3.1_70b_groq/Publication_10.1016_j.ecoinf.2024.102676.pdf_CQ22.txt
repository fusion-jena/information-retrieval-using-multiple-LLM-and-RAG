The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the performance of the FIT model is evaluated using a rank-based performance evaluation metric, which is calculated by summing the rankings for the BCR (Biological Conservation Rank) and DER (Data Evaluation Rank) and then calculating the average. This metric has a range of 1-6, with lower numbers indicating better overall performance. 

It is also mentioned that the study used deep learning models to classify three sympatric otter species, but the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models are not provided.
