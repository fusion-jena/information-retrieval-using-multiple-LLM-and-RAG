The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the network training assessment was performed on sub-images generated from image #2 (Table 1), which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on a validation set during training. Additionally, the loss function is mentioned, which implies that the model's performance was monitored through the loss function, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the performance are not provided.
