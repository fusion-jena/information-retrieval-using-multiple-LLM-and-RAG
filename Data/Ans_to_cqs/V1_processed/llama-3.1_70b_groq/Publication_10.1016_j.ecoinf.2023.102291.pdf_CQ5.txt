Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context only mentions that the smallest dataset comprised 3900 images combining two seconds window size and 90 dpi for the transfer learning approach, but it does not provide the name of the dataset. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
