The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model's accuracy and false positive rate were evaluated. Specifically, it states that "All CNN detections at a 0.95 score threshold from a random sample of five one-hour files from each year were then manually reviewed to evaluate model accuracy and to calculate a false positive rate “i.e. how many calls were incorrectly labelled as bobwhite”."

This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated in terms of its accuracy and false positive rate, but it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision or recall. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the model's performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy and false positive rate, but the context does not provide information on other metrics.
