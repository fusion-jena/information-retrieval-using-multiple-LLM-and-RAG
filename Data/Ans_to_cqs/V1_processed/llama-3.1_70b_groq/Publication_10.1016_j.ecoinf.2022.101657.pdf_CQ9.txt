Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the GBIF database, which contains over 2300 videos of animals, but it does not indicate that the pipeline's data repository is hosted on GBIF. It also mentions that the authors have curated a subset of 330 videos and provided a training and validation split, but it does not provide information on where this data is stored or shared. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
