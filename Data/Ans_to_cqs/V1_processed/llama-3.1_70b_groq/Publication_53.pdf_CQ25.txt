The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used to classify high-definition satellite images into two categories: "dam" or "not dam". The model is trained on a dataset of labelled images and is used to detect farm dams in Australia. The classification model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is fine-tuned to achieve an accuracy of 94.8% with a training loss of 0.1397 and a validation loss of 0.1446.
