Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological data sources, including climate, soil, topographic, and anthropogenic variables, as well as species data. It does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets commonly used in computer vision or machine learning. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
