The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves the use of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and RGB (red, green, blue) data, which suggests that the pipeline may involve the use of image data. Additionally, the context mentions hyperspectral image classification, which further supports the use of image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
