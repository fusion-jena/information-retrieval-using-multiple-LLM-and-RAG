The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the model was trained for a total of 350 epochs, resulting in a total training time of 27 hours. This suggests that the training was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being stopped based on a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau. The context does provide information on the model's performance at different stages of training, including precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mAP, but it does not indicate that these metrics were used to determine when to stop training.
