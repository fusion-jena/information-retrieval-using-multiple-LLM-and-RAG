Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on a specific research paper or study, discussing topics such as Random Forest (RF) algorithms, Out-of-Bag (OOB) data, and neural networks. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, the context does mention the use of random initial values for connection weights in neural networks (Eq. 1) and the use of random replacement in RF algorithms (Eqs. 9, 10). However, it does not provide information on how these random values are managed or controlled.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
