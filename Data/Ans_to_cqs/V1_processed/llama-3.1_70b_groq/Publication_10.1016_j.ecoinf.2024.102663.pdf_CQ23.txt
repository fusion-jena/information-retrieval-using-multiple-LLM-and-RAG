Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the dataset, preprocessing methods, and results of the YOLOv8 model. It does mention the use of a validation set (Table 2) and provides results for different preprocessing methods (Table 3), but it does not provide information on cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the diversity of the dataset.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset consists of images of a specific fish species (Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia) with varying biomass ranges (10-126 g) and image resolutions (1920p*1080p). The dataset size is also mentioned (915 images). But without further information, it is unclear whether the dataset is diverse, stratified, or split in a way that ensures the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
