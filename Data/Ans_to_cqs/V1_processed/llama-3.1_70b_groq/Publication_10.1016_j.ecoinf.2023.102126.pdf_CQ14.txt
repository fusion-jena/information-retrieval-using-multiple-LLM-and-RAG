I don't know. The provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters or the use of a model that requires hyperparameter tuning. The text primarily discusses the use of the F-UJI tool to assess the FAIRness of datasets and the methodology used to evaluate the datasets. It does mention the potential use of artificial intelligence models such as neural network techniques in future work, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of such models would be optimized.
