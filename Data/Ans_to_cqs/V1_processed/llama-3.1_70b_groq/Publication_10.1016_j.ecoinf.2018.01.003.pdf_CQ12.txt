I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. It discusses the development of neural networks, the limitations of traditional neural networks, and the emergence of deep learning. It also compares BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) models, but it does not provide information about the type of deep learning model used in a pipeline.
