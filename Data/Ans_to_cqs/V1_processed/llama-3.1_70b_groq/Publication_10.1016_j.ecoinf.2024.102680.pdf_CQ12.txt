The text mentions several types of deep learning models, including CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), Transformers, and specific architectures such as YOLOv8, Faster RCNN, and CSPNeXt. It also mentions the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution. However, it does not specify a single type of model used in a pipeline. Instead, it appears to be discussing various models and techniques used for underwater object detection.
