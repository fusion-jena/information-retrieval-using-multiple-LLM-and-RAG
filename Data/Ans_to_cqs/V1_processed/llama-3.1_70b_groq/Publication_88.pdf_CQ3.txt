The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe a process for creating a buffer around deforested polygons by applying morphological dilation and then taking the difference between the dilated and original images. This process is used to exclude patches with central pixels in the outer edge regions from training, validation, or test sets.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of patches and mini-patches, which suggests that some form of image segmentation or patch-based annotation may be used. However, the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
