The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does provide some information about the performance of the model in terms of accuracy.

In the table, there are columns labeled "Total" and "Accuracy" which suggest that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model. The values in these columns range from 27.03% to 79.17%, indicating the accuracy of the model for different scenarios.

Additionally, the context mentions "MI" and "LI" which could potentially stand for metrics such as Mutual Information or Loss Index, but without further information, it is unclear what these abbreviations represent.

There is no mention of precision or recall in the provided context. Therefore, based on the available information, the only metric that can be confirmed as being used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy.
