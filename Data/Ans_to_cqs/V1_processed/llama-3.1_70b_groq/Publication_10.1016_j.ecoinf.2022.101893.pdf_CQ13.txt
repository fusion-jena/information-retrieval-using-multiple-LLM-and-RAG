Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only discusses the architecture of the network, including the use of convolutional kernel pooling layers, fully connected layers, dropout layers, and dense layers. It also mentions the use of TensorFlow 2.6 as the deep learning platform, but does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
