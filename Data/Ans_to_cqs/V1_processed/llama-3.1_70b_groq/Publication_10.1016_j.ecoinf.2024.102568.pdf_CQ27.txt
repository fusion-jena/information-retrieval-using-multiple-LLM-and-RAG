Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the training of the LSTM model, the use of a dropout layer to avoid overfitting, and the preprocessing of the data using a MinMaxScaler. It also compares the performance of the LSTM model with the VR + SVR model and discusses the results of the experiments. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
