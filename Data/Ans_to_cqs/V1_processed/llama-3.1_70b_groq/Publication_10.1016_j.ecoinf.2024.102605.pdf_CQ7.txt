Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and remote sensing techniques for various environmental and agricultural monitoring tasks, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to split data into training, testing, and validation sets using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or k-fold cross-validation. The specific criteria used to split the data can depend on the research question, data characteristics, and model requirements.

In the context of the provided references, some studies may have used specific data splitting criteria, but this information is not explicitly mentioned. For example, the study by Ning et al. (2020) may have used a specific data splitting strategy for their rice blast detection model, but this information is not provided in the context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
