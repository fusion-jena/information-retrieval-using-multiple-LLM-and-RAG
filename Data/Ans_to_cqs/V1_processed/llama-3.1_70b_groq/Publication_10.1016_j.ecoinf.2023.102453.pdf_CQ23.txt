Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model evaluation was performed on two datasets, which are smaller compared to the ImageNet dataset used for pre-trained models. This suggests that the model was tested on a limited scope, but it does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or diverse datasets were used to ensure generalizability.

The context does mention that the selection of an optimum model would also be governed by experimentation, which could imply that some form of validation or testing was performed. However, without further information, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of experimentation in resolving uncertainty in the process, which could suggest that the authors recognize the importance of testing and validation in ensuring the generalizability of the model. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to say for certain what measures were taken.
