I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a snippet from a research article or paper, possibly related to environmental flow, riparian ecosystems, and biodiversity maintenance. However, it does not mention anything about deep learning models, preprocessing steps, normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context seems to be focused on discussing a model (FERM) and its parameters, but it does not provide any information about the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful answer to the query based on the given context.
