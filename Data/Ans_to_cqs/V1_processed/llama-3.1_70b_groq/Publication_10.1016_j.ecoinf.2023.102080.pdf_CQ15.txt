I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning or specific optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. It appears to be discussing a two-step covariate selection procedure for species distribution models, which involves collinearity filtering and embedded regularization techniques using generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and guided regularized random forests.
