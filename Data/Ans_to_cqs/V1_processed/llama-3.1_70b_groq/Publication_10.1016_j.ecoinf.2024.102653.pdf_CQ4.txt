Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the deep learning model, its performance metrics, and the hyperparameters used for training. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
