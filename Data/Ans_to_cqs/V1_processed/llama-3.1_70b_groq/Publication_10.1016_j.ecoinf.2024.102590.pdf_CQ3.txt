Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on land-use and land-cover analysis, remote sensing, and supervised learning workflows, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

However, it does mention that the authors used vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of sampling plots, from which they collected training and validation points. This suggests that the authors may have used some form of manual annotation or labeling of the data, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
