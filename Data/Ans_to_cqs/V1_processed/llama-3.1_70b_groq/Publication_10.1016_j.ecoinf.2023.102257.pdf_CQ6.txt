Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text appears to be discussing the use of a pre-trained machine learning model (MegaDetector) for automating the process of labelling photos from remote cameras, and evaluating its performance on tagging efficiency. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved in training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
