To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the context mentions a few techniques. One technique used is stratified random selection, which is applied to overcome the challenge of highly imbalanced datasets. This approach involves selecting audio frames for review post-processing based on the model's predictions, and then applying a random selection that is stratified across the model's predictions (logits). This approach helps to reduce class imbalance within the evaluation data and allows for the calculation of reliable evaluation metrics.

Another technique mentioned is the use of a grid search technique to tune hyperparameters of the final model, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. This technique helps to optimize the model's performance and reduce bias.

However, the context does not mention oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. It does mention that additional research is needed to investigate more appropriate evaluation methods for highly imbalanced and unlabelled test data, suggesting that there may be other techniques that could be used to address data bias.

Overall, the context suggests that stratified random selection and hyperparameter tuning are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, but other techniques may also be applicable.
