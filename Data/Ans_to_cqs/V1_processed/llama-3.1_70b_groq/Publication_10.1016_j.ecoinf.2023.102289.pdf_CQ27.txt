Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is loaded as a pre-trained module (Section A.1.2) and that the platform uses MXNet to provide essential modules and functions required for the program operation (Section A.1.4).

Additionally, Section 2.3 mentions that MXNet is an open-source AI platform that offers a comprehensive suite of neural network models and functionalities for AI development, and that GluonCV is used to develop LaDeco. However, it does not provide information on the specific process followed to deploy the trained model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
