Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and land use/land cover (LULC) classification, with mentions of spectral indices, vegetation indices, and datasets 1-31. However, it does not provide information on the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
