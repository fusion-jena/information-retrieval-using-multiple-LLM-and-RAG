The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is designed for plant classification, which is a type of object classification task. The model uses a ResNet50 architecture, which is a convolutional neural network that has been shown to perform well on image classification tasks, including the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. The model is trained on a dataset of images of plants, with the goal of learning to identify and classify different plant species.
