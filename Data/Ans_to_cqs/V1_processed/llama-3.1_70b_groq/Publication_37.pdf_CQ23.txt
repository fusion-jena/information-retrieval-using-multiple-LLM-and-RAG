To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset used was diverse, consisting of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species. This diversity in the dataset helps to ensure that the model is trained on a wide range of examples, making it more likely to generalize well to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the authors used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models. This involves dividing the dataset into 5 folds, training the model on 4 of the folds, and evaluating its performance on the remaining fold. This process is repeated 5 times, with each fold being used as the test set once. This helps to ensure that the model's performance is not biased towards a particular subset of the data.

Additionally, for identifying the best training epoch for the CNN model, 1 of the 4 training folds was used as a validation set, and the model was trained on the remaining 3 folds. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not over-specialized to the training data.

There is no mention of stratified splitting in the provided context. However, the use of 5-fold cross-validation and a diverse dataset helps to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
