The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions that the R value of the validation set is used as the performance indicator during the optimization process, and the goal is to maximize the R value using the grid search method. However, it does not provide information on how the training process is stopped or when it is considered complete.
