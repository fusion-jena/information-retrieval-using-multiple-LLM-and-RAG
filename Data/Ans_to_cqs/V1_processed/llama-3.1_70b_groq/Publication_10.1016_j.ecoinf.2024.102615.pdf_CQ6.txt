Based on the provided context, it appears that batch normalization is used as a preprocessing step to accelerate the learning process. This is mentioned in the text as follows: "the batch normalization technique was used to accelerate the learning process (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015)". However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, the answer is limited to batch normalization, and it is unclear if other preprocessing steps are involved.
