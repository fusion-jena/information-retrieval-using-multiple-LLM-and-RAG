Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. The context appears to be focused on spectral analysis and pre-processing techniques, including methods such as Continuum Removal (CR), Random Forest (RF), Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA), and Weight Average Partial Least-Squares Regression (WAPLSR). However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
