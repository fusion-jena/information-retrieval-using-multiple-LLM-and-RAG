The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include:

1. Horizontal flipping
2. Vertical flipping
3. Adjusting the contrast (between factors of 0.9 and 1.1)
4. Adjusting the saturation (between factors of 0.9 and 1.1)
5. Adjusting the brightness (between factors of 0.9 and 1.1)

These techniques are applied to the images in the training data to inflate the amount of training data and assist the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in learning spatial features independent of the data acquisition, such as camera settings. After these adjustments, the pixel values are clipped to a range between 0 and 1 to prevent the value range from being enlarged.

There is no mention of rotating or scaling in the provided context.
