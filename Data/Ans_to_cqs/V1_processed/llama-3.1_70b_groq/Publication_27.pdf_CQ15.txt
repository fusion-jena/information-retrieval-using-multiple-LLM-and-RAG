Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters and symbols, possibly from a corrupted or encoded text file. It does not provide any meaningful information about deep learning or optimization techniques.

However, I can provide some general information about optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Some popular optimization techniques include:

* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
* RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation)
* Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm)
* Momentum-based optimization

These techniques are used to update the model's parameters during training, with the goal of minimizing the loss function and improving the model's performance. However, without more specific information from the context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.

If you have any further questions or can provide more context, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
