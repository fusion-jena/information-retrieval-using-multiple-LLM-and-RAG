The deep learning model used in the pipeline is an autoencoder, which is a type of neural network that consists of an encoder and a decoder. The autoencoder is used for unsupervised learning and is specifically designed for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. The autoencoder architecture used in the pipeline is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as it consists of convolutional layers and max-pooling layers. However, it does not use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Transformers.
