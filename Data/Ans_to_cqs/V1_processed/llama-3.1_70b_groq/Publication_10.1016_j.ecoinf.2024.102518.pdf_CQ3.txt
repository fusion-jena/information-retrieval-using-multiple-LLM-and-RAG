Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecological niche models, and habitat suitability analysis, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
