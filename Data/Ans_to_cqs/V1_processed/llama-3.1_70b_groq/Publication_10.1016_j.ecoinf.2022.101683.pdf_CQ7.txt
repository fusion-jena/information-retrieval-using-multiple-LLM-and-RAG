The context provided does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the data was split into a training set (75% random) and two test sets: Test set #1 (25% random) and Test set #2 (Irish records only).

It appears that the data was split randomly, with 75% of the data used for training and 25% used for testing (Test set #1). Additionally, a separate test set (Test set #2) was created using only Irish records.

There is no mention of a validation set, which is typically used to evaluate the performance of a model during training and to prevent overfitting. It is unclear whether a validation set was used in this case or not.
