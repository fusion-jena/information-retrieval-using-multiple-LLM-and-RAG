Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing and graphics processing software for proofreading, but it does not provide information about the underlying hardware resources. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
