Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the use of transfer learning and active learning for sound event detection in soundscape data, particularly in the context of the AnuraSet dataset. It discusses the use of different embedding models, such as BirdNet, VGGish, and YamNet, and their performance on the dataset. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
