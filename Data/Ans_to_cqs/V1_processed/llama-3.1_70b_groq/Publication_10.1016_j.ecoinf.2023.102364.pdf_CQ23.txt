Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a machine learning ensemble approach, which combines the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance and robustness.

The context also mentions the use of a large dataset, which is referred to as "big data", and the incorporation of various socio-economic and geographic information system (GIS) data. This suggests that the dataset may be diverse and comprehensive, which could help to improve the generalizability of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of techniques such as RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, which are all machine learning algorithms that can be used for ensemble modeling. These algorithms can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model by combining the predictions of multiple models.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to evaluate the generalizability of a model. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques were used in this study.

Overall, while the context suggests that the study used a comprehensive and diverse dataset, and employed ensemble modeling techniques, it does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
