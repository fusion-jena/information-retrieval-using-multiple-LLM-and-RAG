The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention batch normalization (BN) as a technique used to hamper vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs. This suggests that normalization is a preprocessing step that may be involved in training deep learning models, particularly CNNs.

Additionally, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation. It primarily focuses on the architecture and design of deep learning models, particularly CNNs, and their applications in image classification and remote sensing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is batch normalization. Other preprocessing steps may be involved, but they are not mentioned in the context.
