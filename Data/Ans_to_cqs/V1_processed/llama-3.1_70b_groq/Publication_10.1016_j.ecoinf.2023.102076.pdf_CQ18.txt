The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the performance of the classifiers was evaluated using the median F1 score over five runs (Fig. 4). Additionally, the context mentions that the classification tasks were trained and tested with different datasets and selection strategies (Fig. 5). 

It can be inferred that the model performance was monitored by evaluating the F1 score on the testing data after each iteration of adding new texts to the training set. However, the exact strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance during training are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
