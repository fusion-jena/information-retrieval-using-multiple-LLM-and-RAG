Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter fine-tuning results, the architecture of the model, and the advantages and limitations of deep learning. It also references various research papers and studies related to deep learning, but does not specifically address handling randomness in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of stochastic optimization methods, such as Adam (Kingma, D.P.; Ba, J. Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization), which implies that randomness is involved in the optimization process. Nevertheless, the context does not provide information on how randomness is handled or controlled in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
