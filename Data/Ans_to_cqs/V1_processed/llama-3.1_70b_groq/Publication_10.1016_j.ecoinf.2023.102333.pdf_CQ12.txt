Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text only refers to "DNN" (Deep Neural Network) architectures, which is a general term that encompasses various types of deep learning models, including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. However, it does not provide specific information about the model used in this particular pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given context.
