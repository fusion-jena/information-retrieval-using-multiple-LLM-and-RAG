The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy and loss on the validation dataset. 

The context states that the model is trained for 10 epochs initially, and if it performs badly, additional pictures are manually labelled and added to the training dataset. This process is repeated until a satisfactory performance is achieved. 

It can be inferred that the training is considered complete when the model achieves a satisfactory performance, but the exact criteria for determining this are not specified.
