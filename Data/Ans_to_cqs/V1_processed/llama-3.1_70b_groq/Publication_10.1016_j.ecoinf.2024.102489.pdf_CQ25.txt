I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. It discusses a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm, and its application in estimating leaf area index (LAI) parameters. The context also mentions that Jamali et al. (2023) used deep neural networks to estimate various leaf parameters, but it does not provide information on the specific purpose of the deep learning model.
