Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of pre-trained models, transfer learning, and cross-validation techniques for training and testing deep learning models, particularly for image classification tasks. It also mentions the use of multitemporal data and Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation approach, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
