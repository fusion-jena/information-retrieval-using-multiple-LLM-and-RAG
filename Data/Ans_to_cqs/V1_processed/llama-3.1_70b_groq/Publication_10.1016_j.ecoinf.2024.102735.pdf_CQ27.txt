I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the development and training of machine learning models, such as random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, including model serialization and platform selection.
