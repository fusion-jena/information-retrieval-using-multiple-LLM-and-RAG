The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Accuracy: This is the proportion of true positives and true negatives out of all samples. It is calculated as (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN).

2. Sensitivity/Recall: This is the proportion of true positives out of all actual positive samples. It is calculated as TP / (TP + FN).

3. Precision: This is the proportion of true positives out of all predicted positive samples. It is calculated as TP / (TP + FP).

4. Specificity: This is the proportion of true negatives out of all actual negative samples. It is calculated as TN / (TN + FP).

5. F1-Score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall).

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model on both the UBD_45 and VP_200 datasets. The results are presented in Table I and Table II, respectively.
