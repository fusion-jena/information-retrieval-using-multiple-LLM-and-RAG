Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of COVID-19-affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
