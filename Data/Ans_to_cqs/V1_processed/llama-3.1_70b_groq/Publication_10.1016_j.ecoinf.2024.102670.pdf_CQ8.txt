I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning methods, crowd-sourcing for data annotation, and the development of a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model, but it does not provide information about where the code is hosted.
