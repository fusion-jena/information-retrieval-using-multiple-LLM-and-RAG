Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of pre-trained networks, fully connected network architectures, and transfer learning, but it does not mention the names of the datasets used. It only mentions that 12 models were generated for each dataset, but the names of the datasets are not provided. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
