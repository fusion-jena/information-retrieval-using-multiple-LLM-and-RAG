Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on clustering algorithms, data normalization, and evaluation metrics, but it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques specifically.

However, it does mention that data normalization is unnecessary in this specific context, but it does not provide any information on other preprocessing techniques that might be used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
