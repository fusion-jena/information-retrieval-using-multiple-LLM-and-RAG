Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses optimizing aspects of the particle filter, such as reducing the impact of particle interactions on computational cost, and tuning performance by choosing optimal grid and block sizes to minimize wasted threads. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
