Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. However, it does mention that there are tools to enhance data or combine disparate datasets (Dufourq et al., 2022; Nanni et al., 2020; Nolasco et al., 2023; Padovese et al., 2023; Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019).

One relevant reference is the paper by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019), which is titled "A survey on image data augmentation for deep learning." This paper likely discusses various data augmentation techniques, but the specific details are not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I can only suggest that the paper by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) might be a useful resource for learning about data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines. However, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
