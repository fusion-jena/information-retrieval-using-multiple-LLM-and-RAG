Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text only describes the architecture and components of the model, such as the use of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation functions, but does not mention the framework used to implement it. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
