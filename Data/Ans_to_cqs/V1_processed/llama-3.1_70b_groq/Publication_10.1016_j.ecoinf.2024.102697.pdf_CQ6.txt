Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the methodology used for training machine learning models, specifically the use of Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning and a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach for model development. It also touches on the importance of model complexity and feature selection, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
