The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the validation set is used during training for the fine tuning of hyperparameters and model selection, citing Hastie et al. (2009) as a reference. However, it does not provide further details on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
