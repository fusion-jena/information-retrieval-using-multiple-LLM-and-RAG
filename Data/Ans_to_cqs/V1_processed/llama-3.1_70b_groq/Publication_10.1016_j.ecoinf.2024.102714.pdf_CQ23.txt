To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the training and testing datasets were generated through reference to existing field datasets and Very High Resolution (VHR) images. This helped to create a diverse dataset that represented various scenarios.

Additionally, the polygons were split into calibration and validation sets, with approximately 30% of pixels for each Vegetation Type (VT) reserved for independent model validation. This stratified splitting approach helped to minimize the effect of spatial autocorrelation on model accuracies.

Furthermore, the model was trained using a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier, which is an optimized random tree-based algorithm that can learn from the errors of previous trees. This approach helped to improve the model's generalizability by reducing overfitting.

The use of a large number of features (54) as input to the model, including seasonal vegetation index composites from Sentinel-2, backscatter composites from Sentinel-1, elevation, and slope, also contributed to the model's generalizability.

While cross-validation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the use of stratified splitting and independent model validation suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on unseen data, which is a key aspect of ensuring generalizability.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model include the use of diverse datasets, stratified splitting, and optimized machine learning algorithms.
