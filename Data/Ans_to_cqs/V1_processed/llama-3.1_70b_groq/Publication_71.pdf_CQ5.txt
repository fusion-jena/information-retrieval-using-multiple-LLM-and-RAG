The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "deeplabv3_pascal_train_aug" as the value for "tf_initial_checkpoint" in Table 1, which suggests that the model is pre-trained on the PASCAL dataset. Additionally, the context mentions that the model is designed for RGB images, but the authors consider using more than three input channels (e.g., including a NIR band) as future work.
