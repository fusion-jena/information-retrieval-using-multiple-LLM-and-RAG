Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling (SDMs) and the use of random forests (RF) algorithms, as well as the effects of resampling techniques on model training data.

However, it does mention bootstrapping (i.e., random subsampling with replacement) as a resampling technique used to increase models' precision by reducing stochastic errors in estimation. But this is not a traditional data augmentation technique typically used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline.
