Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep neural networks for fish classification by species, the computing infrastructure used to train the models, and some potential future work, but it does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
