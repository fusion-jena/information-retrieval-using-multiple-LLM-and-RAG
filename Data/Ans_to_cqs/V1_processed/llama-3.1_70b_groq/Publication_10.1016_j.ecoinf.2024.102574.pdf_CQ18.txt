Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to forestry and remote sensing, and it discusses various studies and methods for estimating biomass, canopy height, and other forest characteristics. However, it does not provide information on model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
