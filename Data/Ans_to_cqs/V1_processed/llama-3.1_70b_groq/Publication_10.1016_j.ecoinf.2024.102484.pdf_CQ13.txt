Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to a study on soil degradation, discussing various factors such as land-use types, natural factors, and anthropogenic factors. It also mentions data collection and some technical details about data processing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as there is no mention of a deep learning model in the provided context.
