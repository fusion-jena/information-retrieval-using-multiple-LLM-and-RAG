To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images. This dataset was created using a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) and was tested separately in 30 forest plots situated in the northern Italian Alps and in 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein (Germany). 

Additionally, a cross-validation analysis was performed on all 130 plots to further validate the model's performance. This approach helps to evaluate the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data by training and testing it on different subsets of the data.

Furthermore, the study also considered the influence of forest density as a factor in a multiple regression analysis, which helps to account for variations in the data that may affect the model's performance.

Overall, the study employed a combination of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and consideration of influencing factors to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
