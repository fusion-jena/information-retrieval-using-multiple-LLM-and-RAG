The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "weather parameters recorded from 2011 to 2019 at weather stations based at all four locations were used for calculating the GDD" (Growing Degree Days). This suggests that the raw data may have been collected through weather stations, which likely employed sensors to record temperature, humidity, and rainfall data.

Additionally, the context mentions "whitefly per three leaves" as one of the parameters used in the study. This data may have been collected through manual observations or surveys, but the exact method is not specified.

Overall, it appears that the raw data may have been collected through a combination of sensor-based weather stations and possibly manual observations or surveys. However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
