Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to soil salinity distribution mapping, groundwater dynamics, and land subsidence modeling, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.

The context mentions various studies and papers related to soil salinity, groundwater, and land subsidence, but it does not mention datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
