Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not specifically address the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning in ecology and conservation biology, with a emphasis on predictive modeling, biodiversity estimation, and climate change impact assessment.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, based on common practices in the field of machine learning.

To address data bias, several techniques can be employed during preprocessing, including:

* Stratified splitting: This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets in a way that preserves the class balance.
* Oversampling: This involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation.

Additionally, other techniques such as data augmentation, feature engineering, and transfer learning can also be used to address data bias.

It's worth noting that the specific technique used will depend on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed.
