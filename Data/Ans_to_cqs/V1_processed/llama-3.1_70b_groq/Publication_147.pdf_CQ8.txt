The provided pieces of context do not mention the location of the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research article discussing the comparison of deep learning and shallow learning methods for large-scale wetland classification in Alberta, Canada, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I do not know where the code repository is available.
