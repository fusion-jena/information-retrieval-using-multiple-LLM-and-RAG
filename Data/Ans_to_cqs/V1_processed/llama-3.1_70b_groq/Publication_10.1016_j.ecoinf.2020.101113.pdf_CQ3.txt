Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that the annotations were revalidated, and that most annotation errors were assumed to be accounted for, which accounted for only 1.2% of annotations. However, it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
