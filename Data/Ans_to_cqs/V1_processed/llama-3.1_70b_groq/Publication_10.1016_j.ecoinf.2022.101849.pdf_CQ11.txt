I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be an introduction to a research study on a new computational setting for regression with structurally incomplete target labels, and it discusses various definitions and terms related to weakly supervised learning tasks. However, it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link.
