I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context discusses the use of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) models, for predicting the distribution of pine wilt disease. It mentions the development of an ensemble model by integrating the RF and Maxent models, but does not provide information on the generalizability of the model or any measures taken to ensure it.
