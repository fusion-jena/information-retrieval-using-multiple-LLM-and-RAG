The hyperparameters of the model are not optimized through methods such as grid search or random search. According to the text, the Random Forest models were fitted using "out-of-the-box hyperparameter settings", which means that the default hyperparameters were used without any tuning or optimization. The only exception was the "respect.unordered.factors" option, which was set to TRUE to ensure proper handling of the categorical land cover variable.
