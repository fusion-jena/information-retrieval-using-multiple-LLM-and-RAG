The provided context does not explicitly mention various data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the initial objects are outlined as vectors in the given Sentinel-1 images and are converted into the darknet annotation format with text files containing information on the label class of objects and positions in the image.

Specifically, it mentions that the objects are outlined as vectors and converted into a format with text files containing information on the label class and positions in the image. This suggests that the data annotation technique used is bounding box annotation, where the objects of interest (icebergs and ships) are annotated with bounding boxes that enclose them.

There is no mention of instance segmentation, which is a more complex annotation technique that involves annotating each pixel in the image with a class label. The context only mentions bounding box annotation, which is a simpler technique that involves annotating objects with bounding boxes.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline appears to be bounding box annotation.
