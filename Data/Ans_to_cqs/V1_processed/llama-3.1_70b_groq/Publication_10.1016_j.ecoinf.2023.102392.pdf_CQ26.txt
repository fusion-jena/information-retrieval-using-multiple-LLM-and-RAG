Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning models in assessing the impact of flooding on fish populations and detecting the dispersal of fish species, as well as land use/land cover classification accuracy using XGBoost.

However, it does mention the use of XGBoost, which is an ensemble learning method that can handle imbalanced datasets, but it does not provide information on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
