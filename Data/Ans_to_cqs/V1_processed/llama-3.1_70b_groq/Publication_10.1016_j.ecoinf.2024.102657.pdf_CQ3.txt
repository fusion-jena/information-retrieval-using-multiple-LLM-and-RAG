The text does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the user can label the song in four ways: by choosing one of the machine learning algorithms' predictions, using a different pre-existing label, or assigning the song a new label. This suggests that the annotation technique used is likely a form of classification or labeling, where the user assigns a label to each song clip. The text also mentions that the metadata file contains classification information for training the CNN and k-NN, which includes a column for the dialect folder, but it does not provide further details on the annotation process.
