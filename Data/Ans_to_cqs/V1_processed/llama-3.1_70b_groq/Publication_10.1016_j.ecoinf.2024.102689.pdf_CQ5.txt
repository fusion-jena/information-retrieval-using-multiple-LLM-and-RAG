Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on research papers and studies related to animal individual recognition, fish recognition, and underwater target detection using deep learning techniques.

However, it does mention a custom dataset called "Arcface_Mask" (Fig. 7), which is not a standard dataset like MNIST or CIFAR. Additionally, the context mentions that Ferreira et al. (2020) developed a program to autonomously gather training data and generate training datasets for small bird individual recognition, but it does not specify the name of the dataset.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or would like more information on the topics mentioned in the context, I'll be happy to help.
