The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically for Land Use (LU) and Land Cover (LC) classification from satellite images. The model is used to classify pixels in the images into different land use and land cover categories. The model is trained on labeled data, where each pixel is assigned a class label, and the goal is to predict the correct class label for new, unseen pixels. The model is evaluated on its ability to accurately classify pixels into the correct land use and land cover categories.
