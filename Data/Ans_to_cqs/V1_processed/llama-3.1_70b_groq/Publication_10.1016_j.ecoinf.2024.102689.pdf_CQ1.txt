The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data collection methods may vary depending on the specific application and research focus.

In the context of underwater fish recognition and monitoring, it is likely that data collection involves the use of underwater cameras or sensors to capture images or videos of fish. For example, the paper by Spampinato et al. (2008) mentions the use of "low quality unconstrained underwater videos" for detecting, tracking, and counting fish.

Additionally, some papers mention the use of electronic monitoring system videos (e.g., Tseng and Kuo, 2020) or high-definition monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings (e.g., Lu et al., 2020). These suggest that data collection may involve the use of cameras or sensors on fishing vessels or at landing sites.

It is also possible that public datasets or existing databases are used as a source of raw data. However, the provided context does not specifically mention the use of public datasets or surveys for data collection.

Overall, while the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated, it is likely that they involve the use of underwater cameras or sensors, as well as potentially leveraging existing data sources such as electronic monitoring system videos or public datasets.
