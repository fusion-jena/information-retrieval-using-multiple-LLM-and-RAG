The provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation approaches for improving animal audio classification, which can be related to addressing data bias.

According to the context, Nanni et al. (2020) discuss data augmentation approaches for improving analysis on many-core CPUs and GPUs, specifically for animal audio classification. This suggests that data augmentation can be used to address data bias by increasing the diversity of the data.

Additionally, the context mentions semi-complete data augmentation for efficient state space model fitting by Borowska and King (2022). This technique may also be related to addressing data bias by augmenting the data to make it more representative.

However, the context does not specifically mention stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as techniques used to address data bias. It also does not provide information on diverse data collection as a technique for addressing data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that data augmentation approaches, such as those mentioned by Nanni et al. (2020) and Borowska and King (2022), can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide information on other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
