Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the selection of hyperparameters, such as the number of neurons in the hidden layer, learning rate, and the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting. It also discusses the importance of generalization and the use of a trial-and-error method to determine the optimal number of neurons and learning rate. However, it does not provide any information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
