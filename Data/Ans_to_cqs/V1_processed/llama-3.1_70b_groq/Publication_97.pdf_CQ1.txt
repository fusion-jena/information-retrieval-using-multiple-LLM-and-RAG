The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training data were generated from satellite images presented in Table 1. The context also mentions that the satellite images for certain sites (#1, #3, #5, #7-10) were used for training, and images for other sites (#2, #4, #6) were used for validation and visualization.

It can be inferred that the raw data in this specific case is collected through satellite imaging. However, the context does not provide information on how the satellite images were obtained or if any other methods were used for collecting raw data.
