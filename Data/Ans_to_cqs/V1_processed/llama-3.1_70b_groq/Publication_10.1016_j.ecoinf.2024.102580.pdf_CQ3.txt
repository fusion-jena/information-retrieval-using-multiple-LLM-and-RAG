The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the study uses annotated images to train the deep learning models, and that the annotation of ground-truth images can be time-consuming.

It is mentioned that new tools are being developed to assist in the annotation of ground-truth images, such as v7 labs (www.v7labs.com) and AnyLabeling (AI Curious, 2023). These tools likely utilize artificial intelligence to aid in the annotation process, but the specific techniques used are not specified.

The context does mention that the study uses semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping, which implies that the annotation technique used may involve pixel-level annotation of images. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
