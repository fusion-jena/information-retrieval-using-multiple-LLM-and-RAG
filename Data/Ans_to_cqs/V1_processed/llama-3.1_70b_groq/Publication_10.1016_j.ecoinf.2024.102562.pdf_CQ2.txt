The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is likely image data, as the text mentions "bacterial image recognition" and "image annotation". There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned either, but it is possible that it might be used for storing or processing metadata or annotations related to the image data.
