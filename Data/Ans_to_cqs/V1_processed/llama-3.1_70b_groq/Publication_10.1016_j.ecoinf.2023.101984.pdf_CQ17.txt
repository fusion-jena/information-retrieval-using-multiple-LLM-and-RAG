Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, specifically the use of the MaxEnt model to estimate the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables to the distribution of certain plant species.

The context mentions the use of a "regularized gain" in the training algorithm, but this is not related to deep learning or the regularization methods mentioned in the query (dropout, L2 regularization). The regularized gain mentioned in the context is likely a part of the MaxEnt model's training algorithm, but the specific details of this are not provided.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
