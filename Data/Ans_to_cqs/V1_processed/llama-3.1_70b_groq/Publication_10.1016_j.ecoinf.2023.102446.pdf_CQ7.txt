Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text appears to be a part of a research paper discussing a study on causal networks using flux tower data, but it does not provide information on data splitting for deep learning model training. The context mentions the use of a Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) and the analysis of data from 2014 to 2016, but it does not specify how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
