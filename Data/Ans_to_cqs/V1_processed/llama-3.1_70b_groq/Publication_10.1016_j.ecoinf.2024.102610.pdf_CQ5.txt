Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict infectious diseases, particularly vector-borne diseases, and the use of remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems (GIS) for this purpose.

The context mentions various studies and papers related to the use of machine learning and deep learning for disease prediction, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in these studies. It also mentions various data sources, such as TerraClimate, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), but these appear to be related to climate and environmental data rather than image or signal processing datasets.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
