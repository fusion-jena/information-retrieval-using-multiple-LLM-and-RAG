The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of weight decay as a hyperparameter in the YoloV3 model. Weight decay is a form of L2 regularization, which is a common regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. 

No mention of dropout or other regularization methods is made in the provided context.
