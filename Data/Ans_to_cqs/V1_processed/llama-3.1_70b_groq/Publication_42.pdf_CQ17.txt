Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text does mention that overfitting occurred when using large deep learning networks such as ResNetV50 and InceptionNetV3, but it does not specify the methods used to address this issue. It only mentions that using transfer learning on ResNetV50 with pre-trained weights and training only the output layers achieved a high F1-score, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.
