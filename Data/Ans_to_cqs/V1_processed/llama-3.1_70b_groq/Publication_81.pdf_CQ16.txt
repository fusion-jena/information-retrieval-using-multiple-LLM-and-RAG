Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the methodology and evaluation of the proposed model, including the use of kernel density estimation (KDE) and the calculation of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. It also compares the performance of the proposed model with other models, such as Autoencoder (AE) and ESK. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
