The pipeline uses multiple types of deep learning models, including CNN-like, Transformer-like, and MLP-like models. Specifically, the selected CNN-like model is ResNet-50, which is a classical model in computer vision (CV) renowned for its robust translational invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features. The Transformer-like model is a variant of the original Transformer model, which was initially designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks and has been adapted for CV tasks. The core structure of the Transformer-like model is an encoder module, which comprises several stacked blocks, each consisting of a token mixer module and an MLP module. The MLP-like model is also mentioned, but its details are not provided in the given context.
