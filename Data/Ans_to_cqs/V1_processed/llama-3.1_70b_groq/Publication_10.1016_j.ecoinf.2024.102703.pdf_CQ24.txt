Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to environmental science and ecology, discussing topics such as trophic states, water samples, and fluorescent components of dissolved organic matter (DOM).

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to the query about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, as it is not related to the provided context.
