Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for image processing and feature extraction from digitized herbarium sheets. It also discusses the use of transfer learning to reduce training time and improve model performance.

However, it does mention the use of a small training dataset and the implementation of transfer learning to initialize the model weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This suggests that the dataset may be limited, but it does not provide information on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query regarding techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
