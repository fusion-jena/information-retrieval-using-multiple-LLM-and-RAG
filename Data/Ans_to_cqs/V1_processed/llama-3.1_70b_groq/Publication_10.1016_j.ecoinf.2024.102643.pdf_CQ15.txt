Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, conservation biology, and statistical analysis, but it does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques in particular.

However, it does mention various machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in these models.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.
