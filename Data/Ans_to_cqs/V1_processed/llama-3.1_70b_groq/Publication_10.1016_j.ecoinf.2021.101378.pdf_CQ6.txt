Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning methods, including random forest and maximum entropy modeling, to ecological data, particularly in the context of predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training machine learning models, including deep learning models. These steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the data
* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve the stability and performance of some algorithms
* Feature selection: selecting a subset of the most relevant features to use in the model
* Encoding categorical variables: converting categorical variables into a numerical representation that can be used by the model

It's worth noting that the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the type of data, the model being used, and the specific problem being addressed. However, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
