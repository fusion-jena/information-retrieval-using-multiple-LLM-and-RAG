Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the design and evaluation of a deep learning-based recognition system for bluespotted ribbontail rays, discussing aspects such as architecture, data augmentation, feature extraction enhancement, and pose handling. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
