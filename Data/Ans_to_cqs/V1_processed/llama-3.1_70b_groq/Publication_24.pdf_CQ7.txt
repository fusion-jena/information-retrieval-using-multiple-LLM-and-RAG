Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It mentions that the dataset was randomly selected from the remaining sites, but it does not provide further details on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used for splitting the data.
