The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through an early stopping criterion, which is based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. Additionally, a 10-fold Cross Validation is performed to obtain a reliable estimate of the MSE on the test set. This approach ensures a robust estimation process with a 95% confidence interval and a precision level of 5%.
