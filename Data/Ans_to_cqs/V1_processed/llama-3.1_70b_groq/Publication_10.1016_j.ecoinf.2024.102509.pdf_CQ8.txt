I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The references appear to be related to ecological and environmental research, including agroforestry, remote sensing, and mangrove ecosystems. There is no mention of a specific code repository or platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
