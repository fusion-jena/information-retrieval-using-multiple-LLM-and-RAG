Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) and the residual network structure, as well as the comparison of tracking results. It does not provide information on data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
