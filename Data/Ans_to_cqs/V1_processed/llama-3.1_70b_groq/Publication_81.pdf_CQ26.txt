Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in the proposed ESK model for classifying fish from different families and determining outgroups. It also discusses the importance of addressing overfitting in small datasets and the use of Elastic Net to solve this problem.

However, it does mention that the model uses one-hot encoding to convert DNA sequences into numerical data, which is a common preprocessing technique in deep learning. But it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
