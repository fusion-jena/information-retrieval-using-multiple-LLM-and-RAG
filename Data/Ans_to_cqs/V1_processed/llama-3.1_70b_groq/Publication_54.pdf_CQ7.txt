The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the endemic bird data was randomly split into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing. Additionally, the training dataset was further divided into 80% for training (25,056 images) and 20% for validation (6,264 images) after data augmentation.

It can be inferred that the split is based on a random division of the data, but the specific criteria or ratio used for the initial split (3,132 for training and 760 for testing) is not provided. The use of 80% for training and 20% for validation after data augmentation is a common practice in deep learning, but the context does not provide further details on the reasoning behind this specific split.
