Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on landscape planning, ecology, and environmental performance evaluation, with some references to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-based methods. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in these CNNs. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
