The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the early stopping strategy. According to the context, "Due to the early stopping strategy, the training process converges before the last epoch, preventing overfitting issues." This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training, and the training process is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing overfitting.
