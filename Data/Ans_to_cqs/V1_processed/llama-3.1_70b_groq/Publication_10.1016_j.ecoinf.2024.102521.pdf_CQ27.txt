The provided context does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the output of the STARdbi_train module is a classification model (ResNet152) in the form of a binary pickle file. This suggests that the model is serialized in a binary format, which is a common approach for model deployment.

However, the context does not provide information on the platform selection or the specific deployment process. It only mentions that the model is trained using the site's computational resources, but it does not specify how the trained model is deployed or made available for inference.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the model is serialized in a binary format (pickle file), but the specific deployment process and platform selection are not specified.
