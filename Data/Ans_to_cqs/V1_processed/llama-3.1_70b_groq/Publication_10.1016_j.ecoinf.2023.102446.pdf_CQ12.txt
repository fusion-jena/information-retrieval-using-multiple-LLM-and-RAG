I don't know. The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline, nor does it specify the type of model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context appears to focus on data collection, processing, and the use of information theory-based approaches, such as transfer entropy, for network generation. It does mention TPINet and TIPNet, but these are not described as deep learning models.
