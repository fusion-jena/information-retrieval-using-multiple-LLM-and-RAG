To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the authors employed a stratified division of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. This means that the class proportions were maintained across all three sets, ensuring that the models were trained, validated, and tested on representative samples of the data. Additionally, the authors randomly divided the dataset into three parts, which helps to reduce the impact of randomness on the results. However, the specific random seed value used is not mentioned in the provided context.
