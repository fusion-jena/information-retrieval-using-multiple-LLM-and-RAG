Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of research papers and publications by Coro, G. and others, related to ecological modeling, species distribution, and data mining. There is no mention of deep learning model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
