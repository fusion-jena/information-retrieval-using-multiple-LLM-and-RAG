The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Sentinel-2 data, which is a type of satellite imagery, and field plots with above-ground biomass values. It also mentions the use of the Global WD database, which is a public dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of SoilGrids250m, which is a global gridded soil information dataset based on machine learning. This suggests that the study may be using a combination of remote sensing data, field observations, and public datasets to collect raw data.

However, the context does not provide a comprehensive list of methods used for collecting raw data, and it does not mention surveys or sensors explicitly. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to the query based on the provided context.
