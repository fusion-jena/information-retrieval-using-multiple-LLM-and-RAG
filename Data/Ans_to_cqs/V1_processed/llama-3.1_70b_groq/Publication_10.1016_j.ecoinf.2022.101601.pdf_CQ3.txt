Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to permafrost and ecological informatics, with figures and tables discussing permafrost distribution, thaw depth, and vegetation height. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
