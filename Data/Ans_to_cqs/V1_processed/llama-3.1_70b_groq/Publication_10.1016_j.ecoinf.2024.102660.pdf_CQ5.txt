The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the WSGD dataset, which is specifically designed for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. The dataset consists of 1764 image pairs, which were split into training (1232 pairs), validation (176 pairs), and testing (356 pairs) sets. The WSGD dataset was used to train and evaluate the Res_AUNet network, achieving high metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and IOU.
