Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the development of a workflow that leverages citizen science data to extract relevant records from social media posts, the use of citizen science data to train a red kite classification model, and the evaluation of the workflow. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as whether grid search, random search, or other methods are used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
