I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the architecture of the model, the loading of pre-trained modules, setting the threshold, output format, and computational efficiency, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
