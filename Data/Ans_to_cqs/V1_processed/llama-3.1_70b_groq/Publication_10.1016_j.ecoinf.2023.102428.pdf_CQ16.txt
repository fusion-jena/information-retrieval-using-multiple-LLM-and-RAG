The criteria used to determine when training is complete are specified in Table 7, which lists the MLP parameters and performance. According to the table, the training is considered complete when the RMS (Root Mean Square) error reaches an acceptable level, which is set to 0.01. Additionally, the table mentions that the training RMS is 0.1430, and the testing RMS is 0.1446, indicating that the model has converged to a stable solution. There is no mention of validation loss plateau as a criteria for determining the completion of training.
