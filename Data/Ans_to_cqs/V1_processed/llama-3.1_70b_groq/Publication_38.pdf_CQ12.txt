The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, two CNN models are mentioned: CNNFAST and CNNFULL. The CNNFAST network consists of two convolution layers, followed by max pooling layers and a fully connected layer. The CNNFULL model consists of three convolution and max pooling layers, followed by one fully connected layer.
