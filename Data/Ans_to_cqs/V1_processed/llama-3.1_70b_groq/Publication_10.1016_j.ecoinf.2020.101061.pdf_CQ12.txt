The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions the use of "convolutional neural networks to learn flexible deep features" and the application of techniques such as data augmentation of random flips and translations, which are commonly used in CNNs. Additionally, the text references the use of ImageNet pretraining weights, which is a common practice in CNN-based computer vision tasks.
