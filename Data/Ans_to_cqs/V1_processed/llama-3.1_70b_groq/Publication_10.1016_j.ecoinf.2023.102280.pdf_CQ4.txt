The provided context does not specifically mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. However, it does mention that "data augmentation techniques such as superimposing noise samples should also be considered as bioacoustics applications typically have abundant noise features." This suggests that superimposing noise samples is a data augmentation technique that can be used in bioacoustics applications, but it does not provide information on other techniques like Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling.
