I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It only mentions that deep learning models typically demand more resources, including GPUs or TPUs, and involve lengthier training times compared to XGBoost. It also discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models in terms of model architecture, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. However, it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build deep learning models.
