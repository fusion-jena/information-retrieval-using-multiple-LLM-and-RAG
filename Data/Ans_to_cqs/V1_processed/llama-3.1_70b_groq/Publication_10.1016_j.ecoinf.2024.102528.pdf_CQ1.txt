Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations. It also mentions "continuous bioacoustic monitoring" and "passive acoustic monitoring" as keywords, suggesting that audio recordings may be involved in the data collection process. However, the specific methods used for collecting the raw audio data are not specified.
