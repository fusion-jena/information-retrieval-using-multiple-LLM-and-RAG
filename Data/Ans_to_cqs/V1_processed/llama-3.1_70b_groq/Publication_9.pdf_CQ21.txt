Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training procedure, dataset construction, and the Sashimi online model repository. It does mention evaluating fish segmentation model efficacy in section 2.6, but it does not provide details on the specific postprocessing steps involved. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
