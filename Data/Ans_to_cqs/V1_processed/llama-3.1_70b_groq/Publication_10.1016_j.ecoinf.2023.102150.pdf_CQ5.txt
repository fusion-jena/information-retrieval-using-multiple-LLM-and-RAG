Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the model was trained on a "training data set" and evaluated on a "validation data set" and an "out-of-sample test data set", but it does not provide the names of these datasets. It also mentions that the model was used for image classification of camera trap images, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used for this task. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
