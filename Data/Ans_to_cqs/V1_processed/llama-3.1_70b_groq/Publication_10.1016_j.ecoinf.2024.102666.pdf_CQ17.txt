Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms, their efficacy in various aquatic environments, and the use of neural networks for AC. It also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks for classification of inland lake water quality levels, but it does not provide information on regularization methods used in these networks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
