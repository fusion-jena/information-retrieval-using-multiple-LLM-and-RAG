Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on specific applications of deep learning, such as image analysis and annotation, rather than discussing general strategies for managing randomness.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation, which could potentially introduce randomness or variability in the annotation process. Nevertheless, this is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
