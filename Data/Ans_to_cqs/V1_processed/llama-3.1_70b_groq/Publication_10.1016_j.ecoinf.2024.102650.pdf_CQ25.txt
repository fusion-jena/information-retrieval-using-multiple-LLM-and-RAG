Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the ERNIE model is used for emotional analysis and text classification tasks.

The context mentions that the ERNIE model achieved significant results in previous studies by learning prior semantic relationships and word order features from massive amounts of data. It also mentions that the model performed better than the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformer model proposed by Google AI in various Chinese tasks.

Additionally, the context mentions that the ERNIE model earned first place for a mixed-language emotional analysis task at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020. This suggests that the model is used for emotional analysis and sentiment detection tasks.

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
