The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. It mentions "training loss" and "validation accuracy" in the context of training the model, but it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision or recall. However, it does mention a "confusion matrix" (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12), which is often used to calculate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. But the context does not provide the actual values or calculations for these metrics.
