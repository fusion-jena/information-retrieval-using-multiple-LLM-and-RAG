Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on land use change modeling, time series data prediction, and multiobjective programming, but it does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques.

However, it does mention the use of deep learning models, such as the LSTM model, and the PLUS model, which is used for land use change analysis. It also mentions the use of random forest classification (RFC) to obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for each land category.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
