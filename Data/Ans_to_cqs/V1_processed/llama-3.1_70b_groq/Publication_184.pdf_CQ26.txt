The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation as a technique to extend the amount of information by adding adjusted copies of already existing data. This can help to reduce overfitting, but it may not directly address data bias.

The context mentions that data augmentation techniques such as horizontal flip, grayscale, blur, noise, and cropping are used to create new images from existing ones. This can help to increase the diversity of the data, but it does not provide information on whether the data is balanced or biased.

There is no mention of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, which are commonly used to address data bias. Additionally, there is no information on whether diverse data collection was used to collect the data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
