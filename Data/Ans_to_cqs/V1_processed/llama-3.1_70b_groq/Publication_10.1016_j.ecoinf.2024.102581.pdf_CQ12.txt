The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of CNN hyperparameters such as the number of convolution layers, filters, filter size, number of neurons, batch size, epochs, and CNN model optimizer. The context also mentions the use of a CNN model in the proposed approach, which is compared to other deep learning models such as ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3.
