The text does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training dataset, and that augmentations were applied in a random order. This suggests that randomness was introduced in the data augmentation process, but the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned.
