I don't know. The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling and climate suitability analysis, and it mentions various machine learning algorithms and techniques, such as Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Generalized Linear Models, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or their hyperparameters.
