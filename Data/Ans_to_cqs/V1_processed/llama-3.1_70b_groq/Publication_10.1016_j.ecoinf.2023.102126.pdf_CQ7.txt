Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to the evaluation of datasets using the F-UJI tool, the FAIR ecosystem, and research data repositories, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
