The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the dataset was "recorded at a different location and was gradually expanded until reconstructions were sufficiently good." This suggests that the dataset may have been collected from various sources or environments, which could help improve the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the text mentions that a higher Î² term in the VAE's optimization objective favors a well-generalized latent space over good reconstructions. This implies that the model was designed to balance the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and generalizability, but it does not provide further details on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Overall, while the text provides some hints about the model's design and training process, it does not provide a clear answer to the question about the measures taken to ensure generalizability.
