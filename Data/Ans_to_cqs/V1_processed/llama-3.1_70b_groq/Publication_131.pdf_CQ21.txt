The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the calculation of a confusion matrix, which is a common postprocessing step in evaluating the performance of a classification model.

According to the context, a confusion matrix is presented in Table 3, which shows the predicted values against the actual values for the first CNN (5 classes). This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, but it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or metrics calculation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is the calculation of a confusion matrix. Other postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps or metrics calculation, are not mentioned and cannot be confirmed.
