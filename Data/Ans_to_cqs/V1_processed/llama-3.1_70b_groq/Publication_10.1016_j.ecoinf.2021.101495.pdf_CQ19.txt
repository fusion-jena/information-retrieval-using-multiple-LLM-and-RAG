The framework used to build the deep learning model is TensorFlow. Specifically, the TensorFlow Object Detection API is used for the segmentation task, and the base implementation of TensorFlow is used for the classification task. Additionally, the ResNet50V2 model, which is a pre-trained model on the ImageNet dataset, is also used in TensorFlow for the classification task. There is no mention of PyTorch in the provided context.
