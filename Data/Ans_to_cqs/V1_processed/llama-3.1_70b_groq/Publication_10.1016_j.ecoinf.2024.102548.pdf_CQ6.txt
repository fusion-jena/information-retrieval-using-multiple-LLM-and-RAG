Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the technical aspects of the model, such as the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transfer learning, and fine-tuning. It also discusses the importance of total model parameters and layers in the model, but does not delve into preprocessing steps.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of pre-trained weights obtained from the 'imagenet' dataset, which suggests that the input data may have been preprocessed to match the format of the ImageNet dataset. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
