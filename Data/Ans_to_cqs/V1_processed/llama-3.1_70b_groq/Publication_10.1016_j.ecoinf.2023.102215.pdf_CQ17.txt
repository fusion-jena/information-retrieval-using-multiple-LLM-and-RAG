Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to focus on the architecture and training of a specific deep learning model, including the use of dilated convolutions and a two-level nested model to capture contextual information. It also discusses the use of the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function for training, but does not mention regularization methods. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
