Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image data. The context mentions "images" and "image classification" in the references cited, and also mentions "feature maps" which is a term commonly used in image processing and computer vision. Additionally, the context mentions "CNN" (Convolutional Neural Network) which is a type of neural network commonly used for image classification tasks.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely to be image data. However, it is not possible to confirm this with certainty based on the provided context, and it is also possible that other data formats such as audio or video may be used in the pipeline.
