Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the classification network, the experimental setup, and the evaluation metrics used. It does mention the use of a pre-trained DNN and transfer learning, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been involved, as the context mentions the use of a dataset (PollenDataset) and the classification of images. Typically, image classification tasks involve preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and data augmentation. But without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, I can only say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
