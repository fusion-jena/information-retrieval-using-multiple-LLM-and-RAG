According to the provided context, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Learning rate: 10^-4
* Optimizer: Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014)
* Number of epochs: 50

These hyperparameters were used to train the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU.
