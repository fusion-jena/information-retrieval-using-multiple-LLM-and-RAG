Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data, specifically satellite images such as Sentinel-2 images. This is evident from the various studies mentioned in the context, which focus on tasks such as water body extraction, water quality estimation, and suspended sediment concentration prediction using satellite imagery.

For example, the study by Peterson et al. (2020) uses Landsat-8/Sentinel-2 virtual constellation images for water quality estimation, while the study by Poormorteza et al. (2023) uses UAV images to quantify wind erosion rates. Additionally, the study by Psychalas et al. (2023) uses Sentinel-2 images for mapping muddy waters.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV files may be used as input or output files for the pipeline, as they are a common format for storing and exchanging data. Nevertheless, the primary focus of the pipeline appears to be on image data.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats, specifically satellite images.
