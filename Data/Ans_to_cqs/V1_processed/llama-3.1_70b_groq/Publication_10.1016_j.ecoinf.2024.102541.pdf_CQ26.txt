Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and performance of various deep learning models, such as YOLOv5 and WildARe-YOLO, as well as their applications in object detection and image processing. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques or strategies for addressing data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of datasets such as Microsoft COCO, which is a large-scale dataset for object detection and segmentation. The context also mentions the use of ground-truth annotations and visualizations, which may be used to analyze and understand the structure and diversity of the dataset. But it does not provide specific information on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
