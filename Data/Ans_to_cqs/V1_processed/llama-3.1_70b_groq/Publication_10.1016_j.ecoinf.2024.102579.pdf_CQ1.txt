Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecological informatics, discussing methods for sampling and analyzing tree diversity indices, such as circular sample plots, nested sample plot methods, relascope sampling, and plus-sampling. However, it does not provide information on data collection methods for deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
