Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, acoustic data analysis, and deep learning approaches, but it does not provide specific information on data annotation techniques.

However, it can be inferred that manual validation of audio recordings is involved, as mentioned in the description section (e.g., "30 manual validations of S2 song", "200 manual validations of S3 song", etc.). This suggests that human annotators are involved in labeling or validating the audio data, but the specific annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) are not mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and I do not want to make any assumptions or provide incorrect information. If more context or information is available, I may be able to provide a more accurate answer.
