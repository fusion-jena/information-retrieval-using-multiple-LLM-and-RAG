Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and conference proceedings related to deep learning, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a specific model.

The context includes tables and references to various deep learning architectures, such as AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, but it does not discuss the deployment process. It also mentions various research papers on deep learning topics, including sequence-to-sequence learning, image recognition, and natural language processing, but again, it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
