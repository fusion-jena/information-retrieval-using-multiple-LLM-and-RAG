Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to a research study on fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used after model training.

The context includes a list of numbers that seem to be related to the study's data, as well as a figure showing the methodology of fire risk mapping. However, it does not mention saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, which are common postprocessing steps in machine learning model evaluation.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
