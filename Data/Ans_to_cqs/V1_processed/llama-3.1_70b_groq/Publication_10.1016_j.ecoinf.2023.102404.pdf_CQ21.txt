Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, specifically the grid search approach used to optimize the parameters of the Random Forest (RF) model, and the stratified random sampling technique used to split the data into training and testing sets.

There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, which are common postprocessing steps used to evaluate and interpret the performance of machine learning models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.

However, I can suggest that the context implies that the model's performance was evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric, as mentioned in the context. But I do not know if any other postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
