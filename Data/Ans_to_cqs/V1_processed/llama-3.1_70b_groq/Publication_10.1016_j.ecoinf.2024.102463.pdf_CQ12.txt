The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Specifically, it is a Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Network, which is a type of encoder-decoder model. The encoder part uses a convolution layer and a recurrent layer (RHN) to generate a latent representation, while the decoder part processes this representation with the past history of the target variable using a recurrent layer (RHN) to predict the future concentration of 137Cs.
