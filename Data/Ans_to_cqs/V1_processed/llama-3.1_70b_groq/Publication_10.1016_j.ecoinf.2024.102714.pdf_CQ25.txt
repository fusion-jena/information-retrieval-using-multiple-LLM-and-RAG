The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the XGBoostClassifier, is classification. The model is used to classify different vegetation types (VTs) based on input features such as seasonal vegetation index composites from Sentinel-2 (S2), backscatter composites from Sentinel-1 (S1), elevation, and slope. The model is trained on a dataset generated from existing field datasets and very high-resolution (VHR) images, and its performance is evaluated through accuracy assessment at the detailed classification level. The goal of the model is to capture the spectral variations embedded within the Earth observation (EO) data and produce a final nine-class VT map.
