The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of the delta in the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parameters. The model with the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0) is considered the optimal model, and a model with delta.AICc < 2 is considered credible. Additionally, the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are also employed to evaluate the model performance. The AUC-ROC is used to assess the model's ability to distinguish between true positives and false positives, while the CBI is used as a complementary metric to AUC-ROC, especially when obtaining true absences is challenging.
