Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the research design, data processing, and the use of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for classification. It does not provide information on the specific techniques used to handle data bias.

However, it does mention that the research workflow involves data processing and classification, which may include techniques to address data bias. But without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
