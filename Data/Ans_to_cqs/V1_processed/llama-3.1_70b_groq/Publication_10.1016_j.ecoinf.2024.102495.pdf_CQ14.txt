The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, i.e., whether grid search, random search, or another method is used. However, it does mention that "Some model parameters or hyperparameters were varied to evaluate the performance of the given model" and that "The model parameters that varied were the optimization algorithm or optimizer, learning rate, and dropout layer." This suggests that the authors may have used a manual or trial-and-error approach to optimize the hyperparameters, but the exact method is not specified.
