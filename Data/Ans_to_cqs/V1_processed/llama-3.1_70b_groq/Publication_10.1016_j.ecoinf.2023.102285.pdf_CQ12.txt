Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that the model is a supervised Deep Learning (DL) approach, and it is compared to a non-supervised technique. Additionally, it mentions that the model is used for object detection tasks, such as detecting man-made underwater objects and birds.

One of the references mentioned, Han et al. (2022), proposes a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, it is not clear if this is the same model used in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
