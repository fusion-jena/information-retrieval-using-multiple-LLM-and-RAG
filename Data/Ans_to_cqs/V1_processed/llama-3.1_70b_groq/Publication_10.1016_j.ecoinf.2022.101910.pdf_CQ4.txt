Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline of BirdNET. The context discusses the use of BirdNET for automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, its settings, and its evaluation, but it does not provide information on the data augmentation techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
