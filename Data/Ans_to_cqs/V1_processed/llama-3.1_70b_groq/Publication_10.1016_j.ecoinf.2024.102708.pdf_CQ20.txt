I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models, such as GPUs or TPUs. It only discusses the comparison of different object detection models, including YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and their performance on detecting Pacific oysters. The context focuses on the models' architecture, training data, and results, but does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training.
