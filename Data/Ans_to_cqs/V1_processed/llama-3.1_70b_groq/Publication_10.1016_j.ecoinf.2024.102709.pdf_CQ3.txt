The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of bounding boxes in the context of bounding box estimation and classification loss (cls loss) calculation. This suggests that bounding box annotation is likely used in the pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of preprocessed images of numbers, labeled numbers, and clusters of numbers, which implies that some form of annotation or labeling is used to prepare the data for training. However, the specific techniques used for annotation, such as instance segmentation, are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation is likely used in the pipeline, but the use of other annotation techniques, such as instance segmentation, is not explicitly mentioned and cannot be confirmed.
