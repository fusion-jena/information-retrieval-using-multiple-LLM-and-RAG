Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that Guo et al. (2021) used a deep learning-based model to classify points of interest, but it does not provide details on the model's hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
