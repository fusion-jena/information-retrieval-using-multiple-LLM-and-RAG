Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks, for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. It also discusses various sampling techniques to address the problem of unbalanced training data.

However, it does mention the use of remotely sensed (RS) imagery, such as Sentinel imagery, and the application of Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform for crop mapping. This suggests that remotely sensed data from satellites or other sources may be one of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions the use of public datasets, such as those provided by the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

But, it does not provide information on other methods such as surveys or sensors. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is incomplete, and it can only be partially answered.
