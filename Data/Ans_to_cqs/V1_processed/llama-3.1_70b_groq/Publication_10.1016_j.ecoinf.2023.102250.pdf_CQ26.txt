The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to enhance the quality and level of detail in generated images. Data augmentation can be seen as a technique to address data bias by increasing the diversity of the data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of spectral normalization, which can help to reduce the likelihood of gradient explosion during neural network optimization, leading to improved training stability of the model. This can be seen as a technique to address data bias by ensuring that the model is not biased towards certain features or patterns in the data.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of attention mechanisms, which can help the model to selectively focus on essential parts of the feature map and enhance the weights in specific channels or spatial regions. This can be seen as a technique to address data bias by allowing the model to learn deeper representations and enhance the quality of the generated images.

However, the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, which are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
