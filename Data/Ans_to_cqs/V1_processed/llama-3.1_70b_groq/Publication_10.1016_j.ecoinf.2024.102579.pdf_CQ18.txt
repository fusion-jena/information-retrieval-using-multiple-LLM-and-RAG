I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. It appears to be discussing forest inventory analysis and the performance of different estimators (NN1, NN2, NN3, NN4, and inventory estimator) in estimating forest characteristics, but it does not provide information on the strategy used to monitor model performance during training.
