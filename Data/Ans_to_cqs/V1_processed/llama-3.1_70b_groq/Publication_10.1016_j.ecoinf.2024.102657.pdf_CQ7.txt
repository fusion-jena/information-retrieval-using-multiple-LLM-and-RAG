The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows: 

* The data is split into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. 
* The training set consists of the first 70% of songs in the folder. 
* The validation set consists of the next 10% of songs in the folder. 
* The testing set consists of the last 20% of songs in the folder. 

This split is used to reduce variability between tests. The training and validation sets, totaling 80% of the full dataset, are used to train and validate the CNN spectrogram classifier, while the remaining 20% is reserved for testing the model's ability to classify songs correctly.
