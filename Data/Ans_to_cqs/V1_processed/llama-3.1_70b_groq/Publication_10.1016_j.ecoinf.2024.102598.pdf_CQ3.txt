I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research paper on forest fire dynamics, machine learning models, and ensemble modeling, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
