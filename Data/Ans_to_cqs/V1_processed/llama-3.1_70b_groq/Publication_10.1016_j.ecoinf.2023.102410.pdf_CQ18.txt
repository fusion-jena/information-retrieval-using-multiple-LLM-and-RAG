I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to data analysis and research papers on animal tracking and vocalization patterns. However, there is no mention of a model or its training process, let alone a strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The context seems to be focused on data analysis and research methods, rather than machine learning or model development. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
