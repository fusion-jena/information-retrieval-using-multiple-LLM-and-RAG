I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of deep learning methods for feature representation and classification of plant species in the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, but it does not provide any information about a publicly available code repository.
