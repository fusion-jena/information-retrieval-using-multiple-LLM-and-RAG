Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, ecological construction programs, and LiDAR data, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
