The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning and the modification of the multipart loss function to increase the weighting given to the no-object component. Specifically, it states that the weighting was increased from 0.5 to 2, as described in Redmon et al. (2016). This modification can be seen as a form of regularization, as it helps to reduce the number of false positives and improve the model's performance on images with no objects. However, it does not provide information on other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
