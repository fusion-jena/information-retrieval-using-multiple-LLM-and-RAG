The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of ensemble methods, including bagging and boosting, to improve the stability and performance of models.

In the context of ensemble methods, randomness is introduced through techniques such as bootstrapping and random feature selection. For example, in bagging, multiple instances of a model are trained on different subsets of the data, which are created by randomly sampling with replacement from the original dataset. This helps to reduce the variance of the model and improve its overall performance.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme to optimize the iteration number in XGBoost, which is a type of boosting algorithm. This scheme involves splitting the data into multiple folds and using a subset of the data to train the model, while evaluating its performance on a separate subset. This helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

However, the context does not provide specific information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a more detailed answer to this question.
