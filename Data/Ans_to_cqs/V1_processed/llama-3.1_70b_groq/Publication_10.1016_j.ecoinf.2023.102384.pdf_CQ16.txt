Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text only describes the data collection and curation phases, the process of breaking down images into smaller patches, and the application of data augmentation strategies. It also mentions the use of metrics for evaluation, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
