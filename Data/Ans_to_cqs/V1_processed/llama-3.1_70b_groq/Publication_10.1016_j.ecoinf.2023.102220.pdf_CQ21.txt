Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the PBP method, its process, and its application to a case study on aphid population dynamics.

However, it does mention the evaluation of the model's performance, citing that the PBP method is competitive with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, such as Random Forest (RF), and that the accuracy of the method is optimized using k-fold cross-validation.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of accuracy, false positive rate, and true positive rate, but it does not provide further details on the postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
