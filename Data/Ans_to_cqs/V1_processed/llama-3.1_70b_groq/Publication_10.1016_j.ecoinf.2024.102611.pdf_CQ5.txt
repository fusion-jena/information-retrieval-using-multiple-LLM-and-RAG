Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that Ganguly et al. (2022) trained their ResNet-50 architecture on three benchmark datasets, but the names of these datasets are not specified. Additionally, the context mentions the use of an Indian medicinal plant dataset, but it does not provide further information about this dataset. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
