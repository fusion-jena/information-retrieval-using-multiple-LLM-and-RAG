Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of various neural networks, including the Bottleneck Transformer, EfficientNetV1, and EfficientNetV2. It discusses the advantages and improvements of these networks, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
