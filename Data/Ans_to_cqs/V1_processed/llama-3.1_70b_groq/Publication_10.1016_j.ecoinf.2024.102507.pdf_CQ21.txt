Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training data preparation, model building, compilation, training, and testing processes.

However, it does mention that after the training process (Step 4), the feature weight and optimal solution in the model were obtained, and then the correct rate was calculated through model evaluation (Step 5). This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is performed after training, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
