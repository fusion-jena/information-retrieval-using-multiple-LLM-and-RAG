The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the model's performance is evaluated using a metric that considers the correlation, variability, and bias of the tested model. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using a metric that provides an overall performance evaluation, but the exact metrics used are not specified.
