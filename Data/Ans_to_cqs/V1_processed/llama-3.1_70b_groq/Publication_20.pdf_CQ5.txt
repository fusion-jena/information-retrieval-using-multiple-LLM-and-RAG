The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as one of the well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or CIFAR-100. However, it is mentioned that the GoogLeNet architecture was chosen as it was the winner of the 2015 ImageNet competition. This suggests that the dataset used is likely a custom dataset, possibly related to fish species classification, as mentioned in the context.

The context mentions that the dataset consists of 20 fish species (Table S1) and that at least 2200 thumbnails per fish species class were used. The dataset was also augmented by flipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis to homogenize the proportion of left-oriented and right-oriented individuals.

It is also mentioned that the dataset was split into four different datasets (T1, T2, T3, and T4) to assess the influence of the dataset building on classification results. However, the details of these datasets are not provided in the given context.

In summary, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset related to fish species classification, and it is not one of the well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or CIFAR-100.
