Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that a correlation analysis of the variables was conducted before model implementation to enhance the predictive performance of the model and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This suggests that some form of data analysis and preprocessing was performed, but the specific steps involved are not detailed.

It is worth noting that the context mentions the use of machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but it does not specifically mention deep learning models. Therefore, it is unclear whether the preprocessing steps for deep learning models would be the same as those for the machine learning models mentioned in the context.

In general, common preprocessing steps for machine learning and deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved in this particular study.
