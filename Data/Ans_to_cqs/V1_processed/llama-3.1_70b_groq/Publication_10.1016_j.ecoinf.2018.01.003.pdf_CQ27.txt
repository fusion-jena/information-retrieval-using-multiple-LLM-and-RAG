Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text discusses the use of various machine learning models, including neural networks and support vector machines (SVM), for predicting ecological footprints and other environmental applications. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.

The text does mention the use of Matlab for experimental process mapping and 5-time cross-validation to optimize parameters, but it does not discuss the deployment of the trained model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
