Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a GitHub repository (https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets) that was used to share a dataset, but it does not seem to be related to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
