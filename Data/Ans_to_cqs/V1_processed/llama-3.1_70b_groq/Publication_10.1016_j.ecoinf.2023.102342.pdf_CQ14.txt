Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters or the use of techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be focused on the Apriori algorithm for identifying frequent itemsets and association rules, as well as some references to other topics such as crop yield forecasting and decision analysis. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
