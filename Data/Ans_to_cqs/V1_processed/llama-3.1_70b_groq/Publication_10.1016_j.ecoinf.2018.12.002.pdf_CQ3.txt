I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on machine learning applications in ecology, specifically in inferring animal behavior from movement data. It discusses various machine learning algorithms, including random forests, support vector machines, and hidden Markov models, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
