I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The text discusses various machine learning algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, and CARTs, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning algorithms in ecological informatics, specifically in inferring animal behavior from location and movement data. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is outside the scope of the provided context.
