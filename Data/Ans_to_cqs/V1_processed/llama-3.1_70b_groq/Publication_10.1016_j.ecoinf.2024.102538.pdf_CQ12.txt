The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models. The baseline model is based on the Xception network, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, the pipeline also incorporates a positional attention mechanism, which is a type of attention mechanism commonly used in CNNs.

Furthermore, the pipeline also mentions the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) as alternative approaches to address the limitations of CNNs. However, it is not clear if these models are used in the pipeline or just mentioned as related work.

There is no mention of Transformers in the provided context.
