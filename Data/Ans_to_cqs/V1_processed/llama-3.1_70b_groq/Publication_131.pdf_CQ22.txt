The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. The overall accuracy results obtained for the first network are mentioned as 96.34% for training and 97.53% for the test data. Additionally, the confusion matrices for the test data in the first CNN (4 classes and 5 classes) are provided, which can be used to calculate other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. However, these metrics are not explicitly calculated or mentioned in the provided context.

The confusion matrices provide information about the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, which can be used to calculate precision, recall, and F1-score. However, without explicit calculations or mentions of these metrics, we can only confirm that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
