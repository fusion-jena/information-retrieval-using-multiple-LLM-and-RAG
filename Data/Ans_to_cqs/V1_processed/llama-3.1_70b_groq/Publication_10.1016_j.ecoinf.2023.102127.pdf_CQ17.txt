Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, ecological modeling, and statistical software packages, rather than deep learning.

However, one of the references mentioned, "Friedman, J., Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., 2010. Regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent.", discusses regularization methods for generalized linear models, but it does not specifically mention deep learning or the methods mentioned in the query (dropout, L2 regularization).

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
