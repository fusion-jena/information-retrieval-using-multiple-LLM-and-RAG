Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a Convolutional Autoencoder, which is a type of neural network that can learn to extract features from data.

In the context of the classification problem (Q1), it is mentioned that the fast.ai platform is used to train and validate models, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps.

In the context of the Convolutional Autoencoder, it is mentioned that it extracts the most critical features and minimizes noise within the training data, resulting in a compact and informative feature matrix. However, it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved before training the autoencoder.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
