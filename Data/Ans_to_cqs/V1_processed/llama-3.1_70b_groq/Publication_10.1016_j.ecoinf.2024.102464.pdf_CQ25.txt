The purpose of the machine learning models (not deep learning models) used in the study is to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. Specifically, the models are used for classification, as they aim to predict the presence or absence of species in a given area based on various environmental variables. The models are employed to generate a species distribution model, which is then used as input data for the IFM-LCONS (Integrated Framework for Monitoring Landscape Connectivity and Species Occurrence). The ultimate goal is to analyze the effects of urban development on species distribution and to identify areas with high habitat suitability for landscape connectivity analysis.
