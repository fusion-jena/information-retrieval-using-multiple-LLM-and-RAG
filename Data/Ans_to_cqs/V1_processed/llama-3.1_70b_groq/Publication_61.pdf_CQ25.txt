The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in the provided context is primarily for image classification. The model is used to classify images of plants, including cactus recognition in aerial images, and different legume species such as white bean, red bean, and soybean. Additionally, the model is also used for taxonomic classification of plants and detection of diseases that can affect them.

The model is also used for feature extraction, which is a complex and time-consuming step in traditional machine learning approaches. The CNN learns and extracts the relevant features directly from the images during the training process, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.

Furthermore, the model is used for object recognition, facial key-point detection, and image captioning. However, the primary focus of the provided context is on image classification, particularly in the field of plant recognition and identification.
