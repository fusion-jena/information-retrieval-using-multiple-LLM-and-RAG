Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the training process, including the computing infrastructure, search strategy, training duration, and hyperparameter tuning for both segmentation and classification tasks. It also discusses the data used for training and testing, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
