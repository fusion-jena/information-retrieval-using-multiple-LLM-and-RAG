The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are specified in the provided context. According to Table 2, the hyperparameter "Train/test split" is used to determine the proportion of data used for training and testing.

For the Segmentation model, the best assignment for the train/test split is 0.9/0.1, which means that 90% of the data is used for training and 10% is used for testing.

For the Classification model, the best assignment for the train/test split is 0.8/0.2, which means that 80% of the data is used for training and 20% is used for testing.

Additionally, the context mentions that 5-fold cross-validation is used for statistical validation of the models. This means that the data is split into 5 folds, and each fold is used as a test set once, while the remaining 4 folds are used as the training set. This process is repeated 5 times to evaluate the performance of the models.
