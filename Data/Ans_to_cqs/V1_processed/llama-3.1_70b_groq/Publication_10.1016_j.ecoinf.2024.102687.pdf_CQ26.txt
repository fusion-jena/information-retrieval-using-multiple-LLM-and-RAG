Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained CNN backbones, comparative analysis of CNN architectures, and their performance on the Darksound dataset. It does not discuss data preprocessing techniques or strategies to address data bias.

However, it does mention that using features extracted from models trained on smaller but more specific datasets, such as bird sound datasets, could improve the parameter initialization of UML algorithms. This suggests that using domain-specific data or features might be beneficial, but it does not explicitly address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
