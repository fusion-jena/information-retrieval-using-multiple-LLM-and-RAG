The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- Learning rate: 0.001
- Decay factor: 16 every 30 epochs
- Optimizer: RMSProp
- Momentum: 0.9
- Epsilon: 0.1

These hyperparameters were used to configure the model parameters by training the last two fully connected network layers in the dataset.
