The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the ResNet architecture, is image classification. According to the provided context, the ResNet architecture is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is able to both extract features from images and classify these images based on those features. The model is trained on a large dataset composed of pairs of labels and images, and its inner parameters are adjusted through a process called back-propagation to minimize the classification error. The ultimate goal of the model is to classify images into different classes, in this case, fish species.
