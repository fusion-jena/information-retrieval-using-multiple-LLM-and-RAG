The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. According to the provided context, Bar et al. (Bar and Paridha, 2019) used machine learning techniques to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable success in identifying minor fires. This suggests that the deep learning model is used for classification tasks, specifically to classify the severity of fire damage or identify areas affected by fires.
