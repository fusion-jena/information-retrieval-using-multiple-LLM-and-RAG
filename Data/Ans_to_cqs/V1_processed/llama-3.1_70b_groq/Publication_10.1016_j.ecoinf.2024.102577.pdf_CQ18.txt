The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 5 × 10-fold cross-validation. This is mentioned in the context as "The mean accuracies and standard deviations of the 5 × 10-fold cross-validations for each method and species are shown in Table 4." This suggests that the model performance is evaluated using a cross-validation technique, which involves splitting the data into training and testing sets multiple times to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
