Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the loss functions used, including the adversarial loss, L1 loss, and perceptual loss, as well as the architecture of the network, including the use of batch normalization and Leaky-ReLU activation functions. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for training the model.
