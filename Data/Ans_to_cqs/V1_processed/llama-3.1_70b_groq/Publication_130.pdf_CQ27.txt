Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the challenges of identifying birds providing care to chicks, the use of deep learning for classification tasks, and the training process of the model, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
