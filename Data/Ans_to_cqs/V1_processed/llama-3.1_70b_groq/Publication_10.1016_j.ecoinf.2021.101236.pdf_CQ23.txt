The text mentions that the overall process followed current best practices in deep learning, which are well summarized in (Chollet, 2017). One of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model was to diversify the training data. Additionally, the 3-s window length enabled the implementation of data augmentation, which is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided text.
