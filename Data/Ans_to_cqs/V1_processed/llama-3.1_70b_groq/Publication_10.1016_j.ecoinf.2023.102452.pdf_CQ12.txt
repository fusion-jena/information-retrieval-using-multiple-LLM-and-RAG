Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various machine learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), ConvLSTM, neural networks, Gaussian regression, support vector machine, and multi-gene genetic programming. But it does not explicitly state which one is used in the pipeline.
