Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on comparing the performance of different classifiers and deep learning models (such as VGG-19, ResNet-50, and GoogleNet) for coral reef classification tasks. It does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in these models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and transfer learning, which can help to prevent overfitting by leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on the target task. Additionally, some of the referenced papers may discuss regularization techniques used in their respective models, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
