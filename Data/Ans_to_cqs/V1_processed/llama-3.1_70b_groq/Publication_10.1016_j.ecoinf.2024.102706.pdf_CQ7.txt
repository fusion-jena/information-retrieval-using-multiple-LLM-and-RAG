Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or proportions used for this split are not specified. Additionally, the context mentions that the models were evaluated on an independent test dataset, but the details of how this test dataset was created or selected are not provided.
