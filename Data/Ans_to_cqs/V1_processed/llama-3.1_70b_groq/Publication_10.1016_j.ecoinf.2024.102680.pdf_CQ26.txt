According to the provided context, one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing is "mosaic data augmentation". This is mentioned in section 2.2.1 as one of the preprocessing operations performed on the initial images. Mosaic data augmentation is a technique that combines multiple images into a single image, which can help to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the preprocessing steps make the distribution of the input data more uniform, which suggests that the techniques used are aimed at reducing bias and improving the representation of the data.

However, the context does not mention Stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as techniques used to address data bias. It also does not provide information on whether diverse data collection is used.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that mosaic data augmentation is one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing, but the context does not provide information on the other techniques mentioned in the query.
