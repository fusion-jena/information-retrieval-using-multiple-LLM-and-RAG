The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and statistical modeling, discussing concepts such as root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE), penalized loss function with an L1 penalty, and gradient ascent method. However, it does not mention deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Therefore, I don't know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model based on the provided context.
