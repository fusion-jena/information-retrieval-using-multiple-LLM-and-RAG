The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, three categories of CNNs are mentioned: PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks. These models are used for different tasks, such as image processing and plant species identification. The classification networks are based on the VGG16 architecture, which is a well-known CNN model.
