Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the use of Genetic Programming (GP) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for streamflow forecasting, and it provides some details about the data split (70% for training and 30% for testing) and the evaluation metrics used (e.g., NSE Train and NSE Test). However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
