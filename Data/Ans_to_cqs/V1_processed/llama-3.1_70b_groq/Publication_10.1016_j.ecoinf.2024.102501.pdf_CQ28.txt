Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and studies related to predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, it does not provide information on the deployment platform used.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the given context.
