Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training parameters, and references to related research papers. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention the use of categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and the evaluation of classification performance using a single CNN-based model (Table 3). This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is performed, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
