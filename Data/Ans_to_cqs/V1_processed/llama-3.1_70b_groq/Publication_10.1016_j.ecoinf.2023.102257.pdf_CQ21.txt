Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of various metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.

The context mentions the use of a confusion matrix (Figure 3) to show the percentage of true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative classification outcomes observed during the experiment. This suggests that the confusion matrix is one of the postprocessing steps used to evaluate the performance of the ML model.

Additionally, the context provides a table with various parameters, estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values, which suggests that metrics calculation is another postprocessing step involved. The table appears to be the result of a statistical analysis, possibly a generalized linear mixed model, used to examine the influence of ML model performance and tagging method on tagging efficiency.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if saliency maps are used in this specific study.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training appear to include the creation of a confusion matrix and the calculation of various metrics, but it is unclear if saliency maps are used.
