The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Neural Network, specifically a Bayesian Deep Learning model. The architecture consists of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The hidden layers are fully-connected (Dense layers) with 32 nodes each, and the output layer is a combination of a Dense layer with two nodes and a DistributionLambda layer that maps the values of these two nodes into the parameters of a Gaussian distribution. There is no indication of the use of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
