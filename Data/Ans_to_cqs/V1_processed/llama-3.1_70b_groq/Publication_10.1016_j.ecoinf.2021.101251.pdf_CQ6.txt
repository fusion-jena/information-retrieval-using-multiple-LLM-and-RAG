Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to data publication, citation, and management in the context of the ESS-DIVE repository, and does not touch on deep learning or machine learning topics.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
