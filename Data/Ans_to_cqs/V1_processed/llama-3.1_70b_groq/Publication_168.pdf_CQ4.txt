Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the design and performance of various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks. It discusses the architectures, features, and results of different models but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
