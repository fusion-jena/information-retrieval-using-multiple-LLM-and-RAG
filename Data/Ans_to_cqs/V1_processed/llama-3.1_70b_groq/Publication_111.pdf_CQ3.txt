Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model architecture for forecasting sea surface temperature (SST) and significant wave height (SWH) using the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset. It also mentions the comparison of different machine learning and deep learning models, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
