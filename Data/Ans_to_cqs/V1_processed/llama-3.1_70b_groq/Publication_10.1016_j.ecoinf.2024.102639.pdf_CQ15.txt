Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for classification and dimensionality reduction, respectively. It also mentions the use of grid search and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
