Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context discusses the iterative modeling process, Bayesian workflow, and the use of various machine learning models such as random forest, Bayesian logistic regression, and Bayesian GAM. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained model, including model serialization and platform selection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
