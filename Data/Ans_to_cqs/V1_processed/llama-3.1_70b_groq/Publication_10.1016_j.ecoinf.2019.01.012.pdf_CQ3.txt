Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the architecture and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, but it does not provide information on the data annotation process.

However, it is mentioned that the dataset consists of nearly 30,000 labeled samples per class, indicating that some form of annotation was performed on the data. Unfortunately, the specific annotation techniques used are not specified in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
