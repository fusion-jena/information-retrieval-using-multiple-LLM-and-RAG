The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the "method was used to estimate the model parameters, recommended by the authors of the mgcv library (Ingrosso et al., 2023)". This suggests that the model parameters were estimated using a method recommended by the authors of the mgcv library, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were optimized. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
