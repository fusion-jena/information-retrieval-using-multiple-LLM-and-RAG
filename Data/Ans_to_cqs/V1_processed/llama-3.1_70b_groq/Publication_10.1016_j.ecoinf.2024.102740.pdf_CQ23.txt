The text does not mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather a Random Forest (RF) model. To ensure the generalizability of the RF model, the authors used the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples, which are those not included in the training subset. This method generates an impartial internal estimate of the generalization error. Additionally, the authors performed a hyperparameter tuning by testing different values for the maximum tree depth and the minimum number of samples, and selected the most accurate results. However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability.
