Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on forest microclimate and its impact on Net Annual Increment (NAI), and it discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) models and variable importance calculations. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques or addressing data bias in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
