Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The text discusses a manual classification method and the potential for using machine learning tools to refine classifications, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
