Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on ecological informatics, and it mentions various data sources, such as NDVI datasets, AVHRR sensors, and meteorological stations. However, it does not provide information on the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention that the study uses NDVI data, which is likely to be in a raster or grid format, but it does not specify the exact format (e.g., GeoTIFF, NetCDF). Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning neural networks, but it does not provide information on the input data formats used in these networks.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
