The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or specific data formats used in such a pipeline. It appears to describe a scientific computing setup and a hybrid MCMC algorithm used for parameter estimation, but it does not provide information about data formats.

However, it does mention that the traces corresponding to each chain are stored in specific text files, which suggests that text-based data formats are used in the analysis. Additionally, the context mentions a Python dictionary, which implies that data is stored in a structured format, but the specific format is not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions a dataset, but it does not provide information about the format of the dataset. The dataset is mentioned as being publicly available on GitHub, but the format of the dataset is not specified.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, as it does not mention a deep learning pipeline at all. However, it does suggest that text-based data formats and structured data formats (such as those used in Python dictionaries) are used in the analysis.
