Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the model, including the use of residual connections, batch normalization, and the AdamW optimizer. It also references various research papers and studies related to species distribution modeling and deep learning.

However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related details. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
