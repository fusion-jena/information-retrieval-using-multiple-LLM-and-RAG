Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for seagrass coverage estimation, mapping, and classification, as well as the challenges and limitations of these models, including the data distribution shift problem.

However, it does mention that deep learning approaches can perform feature engineering independently, which might be related to handling randomness in the pipeline. But it does not provide explicit information on strategies for handling randomness.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
