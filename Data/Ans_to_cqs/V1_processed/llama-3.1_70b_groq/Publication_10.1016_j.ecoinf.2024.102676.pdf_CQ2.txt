The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that image data is used, as the context mentions "images of footprints" and "images of lesser quality" being processed and analyzed. Additionally, the context mentions "landmarks within each footprint image" being rated according to their visibility and clarity, which further suggests that image data is being used.

There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is also not mentioned, but it is possible that CSV files are used to store data related to the footprints, such as metadata or annotations. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm this.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only data format that can be confirmed as being used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
