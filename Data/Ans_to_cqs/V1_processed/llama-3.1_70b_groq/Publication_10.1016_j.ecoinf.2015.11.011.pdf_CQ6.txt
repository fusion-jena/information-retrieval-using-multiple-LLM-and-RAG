Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, as well as the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for analysis. It does mention "pre-processing of imagery" in section 2.3, but does not provide further details on the specific steps involved. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
