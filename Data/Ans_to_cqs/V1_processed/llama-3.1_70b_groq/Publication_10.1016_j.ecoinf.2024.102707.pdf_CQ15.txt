Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning methods for animal detection and surveying in remote sensing, particularly in Antarctica. It lists various research papers and studies that utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other architectures, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
