The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the authors fine-tuned several state-of-the-art CNN architectures using a training dataset, but the name of the dataset is not specified.

The context does provide information on the sources of the datasets used for the indicators of economy, society, and ecology, which are listed in Table 1. These datasets include GDP, NTL, and NPP, which are obtained from various sources such as resdc.cn, tpedc.ac.cn, and earthdata.nasa.gov. However, these datasets are not typically used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
