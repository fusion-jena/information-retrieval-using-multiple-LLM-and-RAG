Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a snippet from a research article discussing a model (FERM) related to environmental flow, riparian ecosystem, and wetland biodiversity maintenance. It mentions the need for detailed data, including meteorological, soil, and vegetation data, but does not specify how this data is collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
