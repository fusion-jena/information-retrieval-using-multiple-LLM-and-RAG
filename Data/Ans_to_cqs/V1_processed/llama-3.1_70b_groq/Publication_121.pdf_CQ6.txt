Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the hardware and software tools used for model training, the dataset division, and the application of transfer learning using pre-trained models. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

The context focuses on the model architecture, the use of pre-trained models, and the optimization techniques used. It mentions the addition of a dropout layer to reduce overfitting, but this is a regularization technique rather than a preprocessing step.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
