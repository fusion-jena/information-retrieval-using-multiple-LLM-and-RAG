Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the use of the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) method in the Hyperopt package for hyperparameter optimization, but it does not specify the hyperparameters being optimized.

However, the context does mention some hyperparameters that are being optimized for the GRU-DNN model, such as the number of previous observations (K) used in the training and forecasting task. The context also mentions that the optimal K value is obtained through a grid search method, and the results are presented in Figure 6.

Additionally, the context mentions that the hyperparameters are essential for the behavior of a machine learning model, and determining the optimal hyperparameters combination is a critical goal. However, it does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
