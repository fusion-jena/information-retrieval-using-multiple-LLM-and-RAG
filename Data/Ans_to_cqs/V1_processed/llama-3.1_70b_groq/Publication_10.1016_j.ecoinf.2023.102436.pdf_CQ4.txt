Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to landscape planning and design, with a focus on using convolutional neural networks for image-based methods and 3D modeling. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
