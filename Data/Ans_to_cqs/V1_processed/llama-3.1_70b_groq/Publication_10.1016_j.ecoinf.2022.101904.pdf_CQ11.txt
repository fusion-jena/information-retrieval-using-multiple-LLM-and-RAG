I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the development of a new deep learning model (3DUNetGSFormer) for wetland mapping, but it does not provide information on where the data or code for the pipeline can be accessed.
