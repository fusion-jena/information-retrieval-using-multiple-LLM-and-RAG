The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention oversampling as a preprocessing step to address the issue of imbalanced training datasets. 

According to the context, limited oversampling was applied to the training dataset by duplicating the remaining pictures until 900 images were available for the training dataset. This was done to mitigate the issue of overfitting, especially when the training datasets are small. 

No other preprocessing steps are mentioned in the provided context.
