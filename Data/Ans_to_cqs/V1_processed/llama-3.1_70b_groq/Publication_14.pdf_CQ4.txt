Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various topics such as animal detection, machine learning models, and neural networks, but it does not provide specific information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
