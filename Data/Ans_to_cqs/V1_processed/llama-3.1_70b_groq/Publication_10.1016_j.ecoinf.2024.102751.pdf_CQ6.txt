Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on estimating soil moisture and vegetation water content using remote sensing data and spatial modeling. It discusses the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and mentions the potential for using machine learning or deep neural networks in future studies, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved in training such models.

However, it does mention the use of metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate the performance of the model, which suggests that some form of data normalization or scaling may have been used. Additionally, the context mentions the extraction of predictor values in a regular 10 Ã— 10 m square grid, which may involve some form of data cleaning or preprocessing.

But without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query.
