The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the model evaluation on the 70 test videos was completed, and the model's performance was measured in terms of true positive rate and true negative rate.

It is mentioned that the model had a true positive rate of 89.3% and a true negative rate of 91.9% using a standard acceptance threshold of 0.5. Additionally, using a more conservative 0.1 acceptance threshold, the model had a 95.7% true positive rate and a 76.1% true negative rate. This suggests that some metrics calculation was performed to evaluate the model's performance.

However, there is no mention of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
