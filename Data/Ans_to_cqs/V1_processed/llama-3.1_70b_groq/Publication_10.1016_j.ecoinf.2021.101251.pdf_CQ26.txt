Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to data citation, data stewardship, and data integration in the context of environmental science, but it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
