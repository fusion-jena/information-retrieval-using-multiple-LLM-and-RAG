The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is based on a random split of the complete samples set. The data is split into 70% for training and 30% for validation. This is mentioned in the context as "The complete samples set was randomly split: 70% and 30% were assigned for training and validation, respectively." This split is used to create the training and validation sets for the deep learning model. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the data is further divided into three regions (A, B, and C) and a cross-validation approach is used. In each experiment, two regions are used for training and validation, and the remaining region is used for testing. For example, in the first experiment, regions A and B are used for training and validation, and region C is used for testing. This approach is repeated three times, with different regions used for training, validation, and testing each time.
