Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the training duration, batch size, subdivisions, and iterations. It also mentions the use of manual annotations to generate training, validation, and testing datasets.

However, it does mention that "Measuring the accuracy of the different CNNs and the effect of different confidence thresholds took several hours but could be further automated." This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation was performed after model training, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
