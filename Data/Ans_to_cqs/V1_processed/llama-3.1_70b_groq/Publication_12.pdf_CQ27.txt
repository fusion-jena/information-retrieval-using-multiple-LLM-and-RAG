Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the training and testing of the model, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

However, it is mentioned that the trained model contained refined parameters and a graph which were saved for the downstream analysis. This suggests that the model was likely saved in a format that can be used for further analysis or deployment, but the exact process is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was tested using both filtered images and unfiltered audio-files, and that the model was used to identify bat calls. This suggests that the model was likely deployed in a way that allows it to process audio files and make predictions, but the exact details of the deployment process are not provided.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query.
