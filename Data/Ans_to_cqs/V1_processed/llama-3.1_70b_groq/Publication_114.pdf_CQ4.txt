The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context, include:

1. Rotation: The tree samples in the form of patches were rotated randomly.
2. Mirroring: The tree samples were mirrored randomly.
3. Flipping: The tree samples were flipped randomly.

These techniques were applied to avoid the distinction of identical textures only differing from each other by orientation changes and to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the deep learning network. There is no mention of scaling as a data augmentation technique in the provided context.
