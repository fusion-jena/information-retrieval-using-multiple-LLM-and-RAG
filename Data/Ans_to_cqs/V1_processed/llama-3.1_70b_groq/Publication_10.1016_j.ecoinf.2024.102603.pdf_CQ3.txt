Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their architectures, and their applications, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

However, it does mention that deep learning models can accommodate both structured and unstructured data, such as images and text. This suggests that data annotation techniques may be used to prepare the data for deep learning models, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
