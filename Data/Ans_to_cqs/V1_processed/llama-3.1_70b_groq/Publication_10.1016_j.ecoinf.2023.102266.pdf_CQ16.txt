Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the limitations of the model, its application to a real wildfire, and potential future improvements, but it does not delve into the details of the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
