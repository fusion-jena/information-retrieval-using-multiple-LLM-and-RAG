Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the use of statistical analysis in marine ecological studies, and it presents various results and metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R2) for different models (e.g., GAM, FGSAM). However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
