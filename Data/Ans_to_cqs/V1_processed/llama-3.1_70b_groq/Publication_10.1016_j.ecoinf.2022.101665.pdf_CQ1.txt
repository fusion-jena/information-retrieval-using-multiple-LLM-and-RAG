Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on spatial sampling methods and evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps produced by statistical prediction methods. It mentions methods such as simple random sampling, systematic random sampling, and stratified sampling, but these are not directly related to collecting raw data for deep learning pipelines. Additionally, the context mentions using existing datasets for modeling and evaluating map accuracy, but it does not provide information on how these datasets were originally collected. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
