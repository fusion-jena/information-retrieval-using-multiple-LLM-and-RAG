The training is considered complete when the validation loss remains constant for five epochs. At this point, the learning rate is reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner. Additionally, there is a minimum learning rate established at 1 Ã— 10^(-5), which serves as a stopping criterion for the training process.
