To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing. This splitting helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Secondly, the training dataset was augmented 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images. This data augmentation helps to increase the diversity of the training data, which can improve the model's ability to generalize.

Thirdly, the training dataset was further split into training and validation sets, with 80% (25,056 images) used for training and 20% (6,264 images) used for validation. This splitting helps to evaluate the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.

Fourthly, a mechanism was proposed to swap the training and validation misclassified datasets and retrain the model until it yielded the highest accuracy possible on the validation and test datasets. This mechanism helps to improve the model's performance on difficult-to-classify samples.

Lastly, five-fold cross-validation was employed to verify the predictive performance of the model. Cross-validation is a technique that helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data by training and testing the model on multiple subsets of the data.

Overall, these measures help to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model by increasing the diversity of the training data, evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, and preventing overfitting.
