The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the labeling part determines the labeling methodology for training the deep learning model, and that the availability of labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications. This suggests that some form of data annotation is necessary, but the specific techniques used are not specified.
