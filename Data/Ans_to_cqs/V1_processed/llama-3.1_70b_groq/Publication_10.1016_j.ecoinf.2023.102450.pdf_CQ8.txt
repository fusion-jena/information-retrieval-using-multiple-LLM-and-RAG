I don't know.

The provided pieces of context include several research papers and articles related to deep learning and animal recognition, but none of them mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. The texts appear to be academic papers and do not include information about code availability or repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
