Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text focuses on the performance of different models, such as YOLOv5s and TPH-YOLOv5, in detecting Pacific oysters using drone imagery, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The context mentions the use of drone imagery and deep learning for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters, but it does not discuss the specifics of model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
