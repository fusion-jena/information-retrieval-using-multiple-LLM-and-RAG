Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses various aspects of deep learning, including neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and ResNet architectures, but it does not mention the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
