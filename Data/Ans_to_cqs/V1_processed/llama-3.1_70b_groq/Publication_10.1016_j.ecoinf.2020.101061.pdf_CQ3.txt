The text does not explicitly describe the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors used the program RectLabel to manually annotate training tiles, which suggests that they used bounding box annotation. Additionally, the text mentions that the authors compared the hand-annotations to a LiDAR canopy height model and removed any trees less than 3 m in height, which implies that they used some form of filtering or validation of the annotations. However, it does not provide further details on the specific annotation techniques used, such as instance segmentation.
