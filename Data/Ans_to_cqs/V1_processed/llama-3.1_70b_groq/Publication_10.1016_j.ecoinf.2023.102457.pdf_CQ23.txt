The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was tested on 20 random iterations for each of the five feature types as a function of distance (Fig. 4). This suggests that some form of cross-validation or random sampling was used to evaluate the model's performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was tested on a range of distances (â‰¤150 m) and that the performance was evaluated using different feature types (MFCCs, BirdNET, VGGish, Wav2Vec2, and acoustic indices). This suggests that the model was tested on a diverse set of conditions, which could help to improve its generalizability.

However, it is not clear if the dataset was stratified or if other measures were taken to ensure generalizability, such as data augmentation or ensemble methods. Therefore, the answer to this question is incomplete, and more information would be needed to fully assess the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
