Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental monitoring, image capture, and data curation, but it does not provide information about deep learning datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
