I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a table of performance metrics for a machine learning model, specifically a MegaDetector model, on two types of images: Motion Detection and Time-Lapse. The table includes various metrics such as accuracy, error rate, F1 score, and others, but it does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

There is no mention of validation loss plateau or any other criteria that might be used to determine the completion of training. The context seems to focus on evaluating the performance of the model on a test dataset, rather than discussing the training process itself. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.
