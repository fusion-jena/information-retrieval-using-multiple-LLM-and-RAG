The provided context does not explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the study involves remote sensing image data, specifically Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands, which are used for image acquisition and processing. The data is accessed from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and is processed using various techniques such as geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, and cropping.

The context also mentions that the original image's Digital Number (DN) is used to calculate the Surface Reflectance (SR), and that the TOA and SR picture sets from GEE are used to speed up data processing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the data format used in this study is primarily image data, specifically remote sensing images in the form of Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands. However, it is not clear if this is part of a deep learning pipeline or not.
