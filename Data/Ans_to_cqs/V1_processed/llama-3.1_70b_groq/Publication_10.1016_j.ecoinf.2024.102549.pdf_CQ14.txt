Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of CNN architectures and the adjustment of network layers and hyperparameters to predict or compare water quality across different water bodies, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization method used (e.g., grid search, random search). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
