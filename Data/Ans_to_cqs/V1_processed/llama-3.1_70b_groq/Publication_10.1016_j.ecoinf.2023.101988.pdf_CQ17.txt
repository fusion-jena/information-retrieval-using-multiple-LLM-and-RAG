Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to unmanned aircraft systems, wildlife research, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on deep learning or regularization methods.

However, I can suggest that the paper "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al. (2021) might be relevant to the query, as it mentions the use of deep learning in the context of ecological informatics. But without access to the full paper, I cannot provide more information on the regularization methods used.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
