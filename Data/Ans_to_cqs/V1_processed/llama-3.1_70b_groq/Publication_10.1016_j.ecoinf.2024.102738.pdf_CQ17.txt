I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification using Random Forest and various spectral indices, but it does not provide information on deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
