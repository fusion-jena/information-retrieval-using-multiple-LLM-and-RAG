Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions the use of three key data pre-processors from fastai: categorify, fillMissing, and normalize. These pre-processors are used for mapping categorical columns to distinct categories, replacing null values with column median values, and normalizing continuous columns. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
