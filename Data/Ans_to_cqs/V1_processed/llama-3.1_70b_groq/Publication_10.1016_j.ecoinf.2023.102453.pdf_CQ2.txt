Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The context mentions image classification, image resizing, and image processing techniques such as denoising and contrast enhancement. Additionally, the context mentions specific models like Vision Transformers (ViT) and EfficientNetV2, which are designed for image classification tasks.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model performance is measured using different metrics, which might be stored in a CSV file. But this is not a data format used in the deep learning pipeline for training or testing models.

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline, as per the provided context, is primarily image data.
