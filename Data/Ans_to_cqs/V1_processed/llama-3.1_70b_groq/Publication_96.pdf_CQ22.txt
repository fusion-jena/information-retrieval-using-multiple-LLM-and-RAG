The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study include accuracy, user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and total accuracy. 

The accuracy is generated for each algorithm applied, but it is biased because it uses the same sample sets to test the model. Therefore, an additional accuracy assessment using validation points was conducted.

The user's accuracy and producer's accuracy are calculated for both burned and nonburned areas. The user's accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples classified as burned or nonburned. The producer's accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified samples to the total number of actual burned or nonburned samples.

The total accuracy is the overall accuracy of the model, which is the ratio of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples. The study reports a total accuracy of 94.1% for the estimated burned area using the MODIS Burned Area MCD64A1.

However, precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
