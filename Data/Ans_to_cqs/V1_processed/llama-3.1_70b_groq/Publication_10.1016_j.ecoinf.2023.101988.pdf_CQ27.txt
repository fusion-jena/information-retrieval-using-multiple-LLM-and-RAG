Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mentions the use of deep learning in the paper "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers, Fergus, Wich, and Longmore, but it does not provide details on model deployment.

However, it does mention the use of Bird Song Id Australia and Raven Lite software for birdsong identification, which might be related to the deployment of the model, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
