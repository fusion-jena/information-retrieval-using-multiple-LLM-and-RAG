Based on the provided context, it appears that remote sensing is a method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions several studies that use remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery, to collect data on various environmental parameters like above-ground biomass, soil nutrients, and mangrove extent.

Specifically, the study by Yang et al. (2018) uses remote sensing data to model grassland above-ground biomass, while the study by Byrd et al. (2014) evaluates the use of sensors and environmental controls for mapping biomass of coastal marsh emergent vegetation. Additionally, the study by Bunting et al. (2018) uses remote sensing data to create a global baseline of mangrove extent.

The context also mentions the use of public datasets, such as the World Agroforestry Centre databases, which may be used as a source of raw data for deep learning pipelines.

However, it is not clear from the provided context whether surveys are used as a method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. While the context mentions various studies that use remote sensing and public datasets, it does not explicitly mention the use of surveys.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline appear to include remote sensing and public datasets, but it is unclear whether surveys are also used.
