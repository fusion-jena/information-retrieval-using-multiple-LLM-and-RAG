Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on the architecture and design of the Res2Net framework, the Deep SORT algorithm, and the use of group convolution and multiscale feature-extraction networks. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
