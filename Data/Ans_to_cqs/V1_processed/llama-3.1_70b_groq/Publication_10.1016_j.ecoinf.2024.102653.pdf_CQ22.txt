The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using conventional metrics, including:

* Confusion matrices
* Accuracy
* Recall
* Precision
* F1-score
* Cohen Kappa
* Area under the ROC curve

These metrics are used to assess the model's performance across multiple time series data points, ranging from 5 to 25 days of records per bee. The results are presented in a comprehensive evaluation, including a violin plot, bar plot, and Taylor plot, to provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance.
