I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a collection of research papers and excerpts discussing the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and U-Net for image segmentation and classification tasks, but it does not provide information on a specific data repository link.
