The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that "80% of the dataset is used for training purposes, and the remaining 20% are used for testing and validation." This suggests that the data is split into training, testing, and validation sets using a simple percentage-based approach, where 80% of the data is used for training and the remaining 20% is split between testing and validation. However, the exact criteria or method used to split the data is not specified.
