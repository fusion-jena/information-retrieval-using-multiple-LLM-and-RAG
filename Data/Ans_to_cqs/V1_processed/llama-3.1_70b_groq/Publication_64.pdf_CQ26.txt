The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data preprocessing and augmentation techniques used during training.

The context mentions that the model is trained on a subset of the Google Image Search dataset, where only the most popular labels with more than 12 images are selected, and the top 10 images returned by the search engine are retrieved. This approach may help to minimize the presence of mislabeled images, but it does not explicitly address data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring are applied to the images during training, but rotation and upside-down mirroring are not applied to images tagged as 'habit'. This may help to increase the diversity of the training data, but it is not a specific technique for addressing data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
