I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of academic papers related to ecology, biogeography, and environmental science. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context does not provide any information about the availability of code or software, and it does not mention any specific platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
