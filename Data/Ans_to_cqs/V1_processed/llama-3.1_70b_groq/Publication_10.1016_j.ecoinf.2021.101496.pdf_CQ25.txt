The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the artificial neural network (ANN), is to model the SPAD value based on the Rasp2SPAD indices. In other words, the ANN is used for regression, predicting a continuous value (SPAD value) from input parameters. The ANN takes two input nodes, which are the two most suitable parameters found by the linear model (LM) and generalized linear model (GLM), and outputs a single node representing the predicted SPAD value.
