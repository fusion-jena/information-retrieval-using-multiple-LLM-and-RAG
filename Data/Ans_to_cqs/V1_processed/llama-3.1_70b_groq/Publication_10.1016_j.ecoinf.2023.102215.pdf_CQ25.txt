The purpose of the deep learning model is binary classification. Specifically, it is used for image segmentation, where the model is trained to predict a saliency map that highlights the important regions of an image. The model is trained using the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value. The goal is to minimize this difference, indicating a better training effect.
