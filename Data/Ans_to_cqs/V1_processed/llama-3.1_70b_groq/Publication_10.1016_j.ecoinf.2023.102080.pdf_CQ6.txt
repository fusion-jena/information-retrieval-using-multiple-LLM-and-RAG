The provided context does not specifically mention preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. However, it does describe a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure for optimizing the predictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models. 

The first step (Step A) involves a collinearity-filtering algorithm, which suggests that correlation between covariates is being addressed. This might be considered a preprocessing step, but it is not directly related to normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

The context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I do not know what specific preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
