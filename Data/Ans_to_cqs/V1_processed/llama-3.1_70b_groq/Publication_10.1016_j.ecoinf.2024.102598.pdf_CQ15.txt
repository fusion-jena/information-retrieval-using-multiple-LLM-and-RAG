Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and their performance in predicting forest fire susceptibility. It does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
