Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The references provided include various academic papers and sources, but none of them mention a data repository. The text does mention that the authors used TensorFlow, an open-source platform, to develop their species richness estimation model, but it does not provide information on where the data or the pipeline itself is stored. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
