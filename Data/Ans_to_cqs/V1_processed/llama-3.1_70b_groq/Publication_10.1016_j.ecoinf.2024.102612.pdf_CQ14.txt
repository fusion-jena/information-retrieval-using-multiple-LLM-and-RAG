Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the methodology for fuel model retrieval, the use of a deep learning (DL) model, and the classification of point clouds, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
