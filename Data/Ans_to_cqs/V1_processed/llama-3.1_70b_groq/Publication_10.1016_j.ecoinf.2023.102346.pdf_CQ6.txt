Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, machine learning, and statistical analysis, but it does not provide specific information on deep learning preprocessing steps.

However, I can suggest that typical preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

The context does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and others, but it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used for these models.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
