Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and training of data-driven models, hyperparameter tuning, and the use of automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques. It does not provide information on the deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
