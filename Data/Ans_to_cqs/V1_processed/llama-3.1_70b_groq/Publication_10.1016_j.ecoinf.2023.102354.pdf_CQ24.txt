Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions, particularly in the context of the GAB region. It discusses the use of the SPEI index to analyze drought patterns and the application of the rPCA approach to identify localized patterns.

There is no mention of how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
