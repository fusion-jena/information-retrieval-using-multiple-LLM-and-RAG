I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to a study on fisher sex identification using linear discriminant analysis, and it discusses the simplification of a model, misclassification rates, and sample sizes for training, test, and validation groups. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods.
