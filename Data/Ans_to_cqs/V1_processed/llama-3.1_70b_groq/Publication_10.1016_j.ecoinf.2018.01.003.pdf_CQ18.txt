Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for predicting Ecological Footprint (EF) and other applications, but it does not delve into the specifics of model performance monitoring during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
