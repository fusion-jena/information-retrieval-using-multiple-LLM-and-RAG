The deep learning pipeline uses video and image data formats. The training data included video clips, which were transformed into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second. These images were then annotated with bounding boxes to identify sharks and non-shark species. The images were resized to 1333 Ã— 800 pixels to match the pre-training data used to prepare the first layers of the model. The model was trained on these images, and the performance was evaluated using metrics such as recall, precision, and F-measure. There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
