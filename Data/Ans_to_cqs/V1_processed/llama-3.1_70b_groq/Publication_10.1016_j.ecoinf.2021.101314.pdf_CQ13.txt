I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which involves setting parameters such as thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions and controlling the length and complexity of their queries. However, it does not mention any deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer.
