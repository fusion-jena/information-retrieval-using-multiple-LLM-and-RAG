The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the model is being used for time series forecasting, specifically for predicting daily streamflow (Qflow). The model is trained on decomposed components resulting from previous steps, and the performance metrics provided (R, RMSE, and MAPE) are commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasting models. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary purpose of the deep learning model is regression-based forecasting.
