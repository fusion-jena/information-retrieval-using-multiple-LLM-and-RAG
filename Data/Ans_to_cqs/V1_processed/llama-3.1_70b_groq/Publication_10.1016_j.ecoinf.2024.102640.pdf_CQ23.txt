To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was expanded to include a wider range of urban settings, such as different types of green spaces (parks, gardens, campuses, urban forests, etc.) and varying levels of urban green density. This helped to increase the diversity of the dataset.

Additionally, data augmentation techniques were implemented, including random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images. This helped the model to generalize better without compromising the diversity of the dataset.

Furthermore, the plan is to expand the dataset (UGE-D) to include photos from different cities and climates, which will enrich the dataset with a broader range of urban environmental conditions. Capturing images across all seasons is also planned to increase diversity.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
