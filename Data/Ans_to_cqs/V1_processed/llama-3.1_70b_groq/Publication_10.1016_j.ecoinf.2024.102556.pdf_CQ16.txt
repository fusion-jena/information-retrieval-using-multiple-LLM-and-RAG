Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text discusses the use of k-fold cross-validation to address issues with overfitting and uneven data distribution, and it mentions that the YOLOv7 detection model underwent five rounds of training and validation to assess its generalizability. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
