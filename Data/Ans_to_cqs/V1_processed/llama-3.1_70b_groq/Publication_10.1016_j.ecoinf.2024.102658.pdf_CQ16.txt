The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the evaluation of model performance using training scores and validation scores, as well as the use of spatial cross-validation (CV) for feature selection. It mentions that the validation scores are calculated through a 10-fold CV, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
