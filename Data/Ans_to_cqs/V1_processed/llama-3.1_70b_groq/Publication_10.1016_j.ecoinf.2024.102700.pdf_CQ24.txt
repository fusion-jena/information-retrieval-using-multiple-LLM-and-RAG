I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, literature searches, and data collection, but it does not touch on deep learning or randomness in that context. Therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer to the query.
