Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "data augmentation" as one of the components that was beneficial overall, as shown in Fig. 3. This suggests that the authors may have used data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors trained and tested 48 different models, which could indicate that they used some form of cross-validation or splitting to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. However, the specific details of the splitting strategy or cross-validation procedure are not provided.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the measures taken to ensure generalizability, it does not provide a clear answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
