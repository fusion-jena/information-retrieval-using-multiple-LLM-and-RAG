I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning methods, including random forest and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), in ecological studies, particularly in predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease. It also mentions the use of R package, but it does not provide information on deep learning frameworks.
