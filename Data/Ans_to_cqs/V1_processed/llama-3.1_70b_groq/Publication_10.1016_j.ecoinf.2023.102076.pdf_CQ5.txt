Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a text classification pipeline, specifically designed for ecological informatics, and mentions the use of a hierarchical classification approach and a pretrained language model called SciBERT. However, it does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
