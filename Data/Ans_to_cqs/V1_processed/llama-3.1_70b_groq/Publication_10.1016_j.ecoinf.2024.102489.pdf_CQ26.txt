The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention some preprocessing techniques used to improve the quality of the training samples for machine learning methods, such as RF models.

According to the context, the following techniques are used:

1. Pixel quality control metrics of MODIS products to eliminate cloud-contaminated and poor-quality pixels and to remove outliers from the training samples.
2. Purity screening: to ensure that adjacent pixels of the same land cover type have similar surface reflectance or LAI, and have enough MODIS pixels.
3. Mixed pixel linear decomposition: to address the issue of mixed pixels in MODIS data.

These techniques are used to improve the quality of the training samples, but they do not specifically address data bias. Therefore, I do not know if the techniques mentioned in the query (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection) are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
