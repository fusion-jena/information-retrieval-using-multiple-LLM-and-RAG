Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps produced by calibrated statistical prediction methods, particularly in the context of geostatistics and spatial modeling.

However, it does mention the use of weights applied to individual observations, such as inverse sampling intensities for cross-validation method 3, which could be related to preprocessing steps. Additionally, the context mentions the use of simulated residuals at the N nodes of the grid covering the entire study area, which might involve some form of data transformation or preprocessing.

But, in general, the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are typically involved before training a deep learning model.
