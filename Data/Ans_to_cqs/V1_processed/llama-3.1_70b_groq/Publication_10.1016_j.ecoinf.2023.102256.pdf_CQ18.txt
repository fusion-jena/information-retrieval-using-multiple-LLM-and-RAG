The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained for 40 epochs and the training process was performed ten times to account for the effect of random weight initialization in neural networks. Additionally, the model's performance was evaluated on the testing dataset after each execution, and the confusion matrix, number of True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN) were recorded. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored and evaluated after each training session, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor performance during training are not mentioned.
