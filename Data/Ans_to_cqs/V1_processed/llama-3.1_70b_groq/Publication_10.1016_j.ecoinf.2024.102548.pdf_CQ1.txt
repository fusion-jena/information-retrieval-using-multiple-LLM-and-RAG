Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the technical aspects of the model, including the use of RNNs, transfer learning, and various pre-trained architectures such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2. It also discusses the model's parameters, layers, and architectural complexity, but does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
