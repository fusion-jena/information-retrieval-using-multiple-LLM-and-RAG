Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the formulation of the SVR model, the comparison of its performance with other models, and the analysis of forecasting results. It does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques employed to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

However, it is mentioned that the model's performance was evaluated using the MAPE and RMSE metrics, and the results were compared with other models. This suggests that some form of evaluation was performed, but the specifics of the evaluation methodology are not provided.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
