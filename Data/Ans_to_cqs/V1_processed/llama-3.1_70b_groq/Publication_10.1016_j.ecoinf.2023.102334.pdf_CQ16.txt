Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text discusses the training process and the performance of the model, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training, such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or number of epochs.

However, it is mentioned that the model was trained and the training results are illustrated in Fig. 11, which suggests that the training process was evaluated based on its performance on a validation set. But the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
