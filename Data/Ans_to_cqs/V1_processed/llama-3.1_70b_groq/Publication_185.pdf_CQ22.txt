The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. It mentions that the MG and MO models "perform well in their own validation set" and that the validation accuracy was 94% for a new model trained with balanced data. Additionally, it mentions a "recognition rate" for the family Hesperiidae, but it does not provide a clear definition of this metric. Therefore, the only metric that can be confirmed is accuracy.
