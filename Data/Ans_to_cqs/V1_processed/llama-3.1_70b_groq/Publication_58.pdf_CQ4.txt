Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that the authors tried several methods to balance the data sets, but found negligible differences in performance, and ultimately used the median frequency balancing method. However, it does not provide information on other data augmentation techniques that may have been applied.
