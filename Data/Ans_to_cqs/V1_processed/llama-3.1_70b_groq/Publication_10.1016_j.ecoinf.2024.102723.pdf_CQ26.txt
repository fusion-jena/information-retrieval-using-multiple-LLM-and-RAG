Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of neural networks, Bayesian deep learning, and its application in agriculture, but it does not discuss data preprocessing techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
