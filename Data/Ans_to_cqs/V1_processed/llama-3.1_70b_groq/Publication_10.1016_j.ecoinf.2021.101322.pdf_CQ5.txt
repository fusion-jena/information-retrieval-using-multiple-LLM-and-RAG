The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the text mentions the use of a "Salmon scale 9056 image dataset" with a DOI (doi:10.21335/NMDC-1050865887) and another image dataset with a DOI (doi:10.21). Additionally, the text mentions the use of pre-trained weights from EfficientNet-B4, which was trained on the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, while the primary datasets used are specific to the task at hand (salmon scale image classification), the model architecture and pre-trained weights are based on the ImageNet dataset.
