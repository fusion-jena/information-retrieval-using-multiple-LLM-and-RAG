Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the hyperparameter search for classification and regression models, the use of few-shot learning, and the manual labeling of otoliths for age determination.

However, it does mention that the authors performed a hyperparameter search to identify the right level of regularization for their models. For the linear regression model, they considered values of α that determine the L2 regularization and observed that the model shows stable performance for α values in the interval [5.0, 15.0]. For the SVC model, they explored a C value in the interval [0.001, 1] and chose C = 0.1.

But, it does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
