Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including the evaluation metrics, training time, and the choice of optimizer. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
