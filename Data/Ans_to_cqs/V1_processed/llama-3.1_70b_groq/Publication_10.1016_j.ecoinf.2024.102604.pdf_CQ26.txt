The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various methods for correcting sampling bias in species distribution modeling (SDM), which may be relevant to addressing data bias in general.

Some of the methods mentioned in the context include:

1. Aggregation background method
2. Geographic filtering
3. Similarity background method
4. Restricted background method
5. Thickening background method
6. Weaken bias covariates method

These methods are designed to correct for different types of bias, such as OS (oversampling) bias and RD (restricted distance) bias, in environmental spaces. However, it is unclear whether these methods are directly applicable to the deep learning pipeline.

Regarding the specific techniques mentioned in the query, the context does not mention:

1. Stratified splitting
2. Oversampling
3. Undersampling
4. Diverse data collection

These techniques may be relevant to addressing data bias in the deep learning pipeline, but they are not discussed in the provided context.
