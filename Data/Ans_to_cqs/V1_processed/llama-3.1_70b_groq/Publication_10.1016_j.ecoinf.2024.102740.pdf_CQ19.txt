Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on using machine learning techniques for grassland classification and assessment, but it does not provide information on the specific deep learning frameworks used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
