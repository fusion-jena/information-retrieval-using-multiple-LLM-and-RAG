I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to a tool for analyzing and visualizing environmental data, specifically pollutant loads and social vulnerability indices. It discusses features of the tool, such as filtering metrics, selecting basemaps, and accessing pollutant loads before and after BMP (Best Management Practices) implementation. However, it does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques.
