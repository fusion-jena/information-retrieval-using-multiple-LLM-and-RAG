Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that a hyperparameter tuning methodology utilizing grid search was employed to obtain the optimal values of various hyperparameters, but it does not provide details on what those hyperparameters are. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
