Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various studies and their approaches to plant species classification, disease detection, and image acquisition challenges. It mentions different deep learning architectures, such as VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Convolutional Neural Networks, but does not provide information on the regularization methods used.

However, it does mention the use of "batch updated stochastic gradient descent technique" in the study by Barhate et al. (2023), which is an optimization algorithm, but not a regularization method per se.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
