The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images. 

The context mentions "karyotyping images of chromosomes", "fungal images", and "3D volumetric images", which suggests that the data format used is image-based. There is no mention of audio or video data formats. Additionally, the context mentions the use of crowd-sourcing for manual annotation of images, which further supports the idea that images are the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline. 

There is no mention of CSV data format in the provided context. Therefore, it is unlikely that CSV is used as a data format in the deep learning pipeline.
