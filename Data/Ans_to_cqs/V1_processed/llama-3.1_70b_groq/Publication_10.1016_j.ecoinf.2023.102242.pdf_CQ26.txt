Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of representative and sufficient training samples, and the potential issues of data redundancy.

However, it does mention the use of "feature optimization tools" to address the issue of insufficient or excessive training samples, but it does not elaborate on what these tools are or how they work.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.
