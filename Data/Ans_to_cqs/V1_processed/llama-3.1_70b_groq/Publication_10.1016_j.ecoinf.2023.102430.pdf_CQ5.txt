The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions that the algorithms were trained on a random subset of 5256 pictures (80% of the 6570-picture dataset) and that the dataset consists of low-resolution pictures of triatomine bugs taken with ordinary cellphone cameras. The context does not provide any information about the use of well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
