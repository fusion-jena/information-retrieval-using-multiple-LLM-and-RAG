Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the development and training of the model, including the selection of hyperparameters and the use of the Adam algorithm as the optimizer. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
