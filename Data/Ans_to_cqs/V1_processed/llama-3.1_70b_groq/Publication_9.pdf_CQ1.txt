The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of computer vision techniques for image pre-processing in biology and the application of deep learning algorithms for image analysis. 

It also mentions the use of digitized specimens as an indispensable resource for rapidly acquiring big datasets. This suggests that the raw data may be collected through digitization of specimens, but the exact methods used for digitization are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of public datasets, such as ImageNet, which is a large-scale hierarchical image database. This suggests that public datasets may be one of the sources of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, the context does not provide information on the use of surveys or sensors for collecting raw data. Therefore, the answer to the query is incomplete, and it can be concluded that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline may include digitization of specimens and public datasets, but the exact methods used are not specified.
