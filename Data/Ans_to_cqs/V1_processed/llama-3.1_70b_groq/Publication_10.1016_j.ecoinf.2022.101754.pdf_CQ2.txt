The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references and the content, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be related to remote sensing data, such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point cloud data and satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat 8 data).

The context mentions the use of ALS (Airborne Laser Scanning) data, which is a type of LiDAR data, and Landsat 8 data, which is a type of satellite imagery. The data is preprocessed and used to calculate descriptive statistics, which are then used as predictors in machine learning models.

Therefore, it is likely that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are related to these types of data, such as point cloud data (e.g., .las, .laz) and raster data (e.g., .tif, .jpg). However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
