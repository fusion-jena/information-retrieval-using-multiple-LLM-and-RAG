Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the system structure, the use of LSTM models, and the comparison with other methods, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing.

However, it is mentioned that the proposed LSTM-based method can directly use the BLS profile without clustering, suggesting that the model may be able to handle raw data without extensive preprocessing. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of feature selection and the use of a larger feature domain, but it does not provide specific details on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
