Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the classification network, evaluation metrics, and comparison of different methods for pollen-bearing bee detection. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

However, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting. But without explicit information, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
