The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning with pre-trained COCO weights, which suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was able to successfully automate image segmentation of fishes currently unrepresented within COCO out-of-the-box, which implies that the model has some level of generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of a model. It is also not clear if the dataset used for training the model was diverse and representative of the problem domain.

Therefore, while the context provides some hints about the generalizability of the model, it does not provide a complete picture of the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.
