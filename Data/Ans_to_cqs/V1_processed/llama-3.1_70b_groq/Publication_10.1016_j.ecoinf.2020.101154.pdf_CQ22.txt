The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the hyperparameters were tuned to achieve the "highest level of accuracy" and that the performance of the models was evaluated based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE). 

Therefore, it can be inferred that accuracy and MSE are two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, it is not clear if other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. were also used. 

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting, which suggests that the model's performance was monitored on a validation set during training, but the specific metrics used for this purpose are not mentioned.
