Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context only provides information about the performance metrics used to evaluate the model (Table 4) and the performance of the image quality model on the test data (Table 5). It also mentions a workflow performance improvement, but it does not provide details on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
