Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of specific neural networks, including BoTNet and EfficientNetV2, and their applications in image classification tasks. It does not discuss the topic of randomness or random seed values in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
