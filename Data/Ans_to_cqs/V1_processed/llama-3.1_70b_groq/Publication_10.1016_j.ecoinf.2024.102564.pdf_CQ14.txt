The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: the number of random regression trees (ntree), the number of division variables (mtry), and the minimum size of nodes (node size). The context also mentions that ntree was tested with values ranging from 20 to 100 trees, but it does not provide information on how these values were selected or optimized. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
