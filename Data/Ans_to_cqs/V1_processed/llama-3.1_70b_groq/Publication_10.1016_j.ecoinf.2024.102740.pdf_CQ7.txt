Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of Random Forest (RF) technique for classification and regression tasks.

In the context of RF, it is mentioned that the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples are used for validation, which are those not included in the training subset. This implies that the data is split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria for splitting the data are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that 34 ground data points were used for ML training, and the total number of samples used for validation is 8. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split into training and validation sets.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
