The provided context does not specifically mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of off-the-shelf components such as "PCs and graphics cards" in building the system. This suggests that graphics cards, which are often used as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for accelerating deep learning computations, might be used for training the model. However, it does not provide explicit information about the use of GPUs or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for training the deep learning model.
