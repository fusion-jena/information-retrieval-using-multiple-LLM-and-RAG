According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly stated for the Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models. However, it is mentioned that the authors "selected 40%, 50%, 60% and 70% of the initial observations of the time series for training and the complement as test sets" to obtain the accuracy, true-positive rates, and false-positive rates. This suggests that the data was split into training and test sets using a percentage-based approach, but the specific criteria or method used to split the data is not provided.

It is also worth noting that there is no mention of a validation set in the provided context. The authors only mention training and test sets, which suggests that they may not have used a separate validation set for hyperparameter tuning or model evaluation.
