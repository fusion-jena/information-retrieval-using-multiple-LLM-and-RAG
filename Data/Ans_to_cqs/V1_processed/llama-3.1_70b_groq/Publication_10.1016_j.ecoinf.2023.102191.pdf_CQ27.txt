I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be related to a monitoring program and an app used for post-dive debriefing, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. The context mentions the use of machine learning in a single sentence, referencing a study by Saoud et al. (2020), but it does not provide any details on the deployment process.
