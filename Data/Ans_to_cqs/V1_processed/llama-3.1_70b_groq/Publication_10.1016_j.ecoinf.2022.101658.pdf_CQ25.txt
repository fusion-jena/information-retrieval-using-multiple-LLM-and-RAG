The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the text, which mentions "semantic segmentation training and testing" and "deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm". Semantic segmentation is a type of computer vision task where the model is trained to assign a class label to each pixel in an image, effectively segmenting the image into different regions or classes. In this specific study, the model is being used to classify fuel types in images, with 10 classes being considered.
