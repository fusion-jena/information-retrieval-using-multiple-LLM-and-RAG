Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for oil palm yield prediction. The text only mentions that the data was preprocessed and divided into training, validation, and test sets, but it does not provide information on the original data format. It can be inferred that the data might be in a tabular format (e.g., CSV) since the text mentions the use of machine learning algorithms such as AdaBoost Regressor and Support Vector Regressor, which typically work with numerical data. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact data format used in the pipeline.
