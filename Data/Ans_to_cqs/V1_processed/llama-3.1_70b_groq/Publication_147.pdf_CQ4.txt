Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning (CNN) and shallow learning (XGBoost) methods for wetland class mapping in Alberta, Canada, but it does not provide details on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

However, it is common in remote sensing and computer vision applications to use data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the robustness of the model. Techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping can be used to generate new training samples from existing ones. But without specific information from the context, we cannot confirm if these techniques were applied in this particular study.
