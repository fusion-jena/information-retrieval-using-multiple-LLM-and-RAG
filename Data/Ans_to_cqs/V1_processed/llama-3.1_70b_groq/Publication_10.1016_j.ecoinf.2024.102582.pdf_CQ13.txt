Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the analysis of mangrove forest changes and the use of remote sensing and machine learning techniques, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
