The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The context mentions that the model's performance is assessed by calculating these metrics, but it does not provide information on how the performance is monitored during training.

However, it can be noted that the context mentions the use of training and validation accuracy curves, as well as loss curves, which are typically used to monitor a model's performance during training. The context also mentions that the model is trained for 100 epochs, which suggests that the model's performance is evaluated at each epoch. But the exact strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training is not provided.
