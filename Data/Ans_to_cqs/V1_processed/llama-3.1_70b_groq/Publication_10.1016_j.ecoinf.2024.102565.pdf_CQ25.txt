The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression, specifically to predict Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration based on wind speed data. The text mentions that the model is used for tasks such as classification and regression, and later specifies that the objective is to "pinpoint the most effective algorithm tailored for this particular application by scrutinizing each modelâ€™s capability to predict TSM concentration solely based on wind speed data." This indicates that the primary goal of the model is to make predictions about TSM concentration using wind speed as input.
