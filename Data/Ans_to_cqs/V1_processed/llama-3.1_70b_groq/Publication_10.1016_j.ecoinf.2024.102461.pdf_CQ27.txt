Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text discusses the use of remote sensing data, modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks and logistic regression, and the validation of fire risk maps, but it does not provide information on the deployment of the trained model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
