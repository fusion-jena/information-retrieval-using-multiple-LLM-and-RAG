I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that Deneu et al. (2022) used a convolutional neural network to model the distribution of species, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the model. Additionally, the context focuses on the use of UMAP and Maxent for species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
