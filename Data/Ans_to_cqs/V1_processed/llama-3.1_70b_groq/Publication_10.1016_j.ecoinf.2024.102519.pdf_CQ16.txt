I don't know. The provided context does not mention training or validation loss plateau, and it appears to be related to ecological source analysis and ecosystem services demand calculation. The context discusses the use of different parameters (P and G) and minimum fitness values to obtain ecological sources, but it does not provide information on training or validation loss plateau.
