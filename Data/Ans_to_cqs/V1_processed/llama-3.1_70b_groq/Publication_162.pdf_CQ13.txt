Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only discusses the architecture of the D-Mask R-CNN model, the normalization of input channels, and the evaluation metrics used, but does not provide information on the hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
