Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of manual annotations to generate training, validation, and testing datasets, and the use of Biigle annotations (label name, center x, center y, etc.). This suggests that the data may be collected through manual annotation of images or videos, possibly from underwater surveys or sensors. Additionally, the context mentions the use of large marine image collections, which could be a source of raw data.

However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer to this question. The context does not mention the use of public datasets, sensors, or other methods that may be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
