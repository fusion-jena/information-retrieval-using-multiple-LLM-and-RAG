The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. According to the context, the original dataset was manually annotated using Make Sense, with a single "bug" class, fully containing the visible outline of the NBSB insects. This suggests that the annotation technique used was bounding box annotation, where a rectangular box is drawn around the object of interest (in this case, the NBSB insects) to label it. There is no mention of instance segmentation, which is a more complex annotation technique that involves labeling each pixel of the object of interest.
