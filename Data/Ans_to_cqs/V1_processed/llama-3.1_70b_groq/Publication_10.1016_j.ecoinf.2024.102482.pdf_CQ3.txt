Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in ecology, the use of BLS entropy profiles to characterize swimming behavior of C. elegans, and the comparison of machine learning methods. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
