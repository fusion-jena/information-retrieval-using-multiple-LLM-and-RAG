I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on a specific problem of structurally incomplete target labels in a regression setting, particularly in the context of predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. It discusses various types of label noise and incompleteness, as well as approaches for addressing these issues, but does not mention data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
