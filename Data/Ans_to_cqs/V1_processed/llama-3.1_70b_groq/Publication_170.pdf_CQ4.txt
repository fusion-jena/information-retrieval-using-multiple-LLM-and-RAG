Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning models, specifically the AlexNet model, for image classification tasks, and the adaptive incremental training method used to improve the model's accuracy. It also discusses the challenges of manually preparing large-scale training images and the use of small-scale training sets. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
