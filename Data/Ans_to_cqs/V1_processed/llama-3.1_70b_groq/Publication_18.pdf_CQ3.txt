The provided context does not explicitly discuss various data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention one specific technique: bounding box annotation. According to the context, the training dataset for the CNN model contains 700 aerial images with whales and background, in which each whale is annotated within a bounding box (the total number of bounding boxes is 945). This suggests that bounding box annotation is used to label the location of whales in the images.

There is no mention of instance segmentation in the provided context. Instance segmentation is a technique that involves annotating each instance of an object in an image, including its boundaries and class label. While bounding box annotation is a simpler technique that only requires annotating the location of an object with a rectangular box, instance segmentation provides more detailed information about the object's shape and boundaries.

In summary, the provided context only mentions bounding box annotation as a data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline. It does not provide information on other techniques such as instance segmentation.
