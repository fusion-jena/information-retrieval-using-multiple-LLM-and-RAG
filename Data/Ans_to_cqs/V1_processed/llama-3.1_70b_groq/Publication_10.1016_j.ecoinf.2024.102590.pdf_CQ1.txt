The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study used aerial images of KNP (Kruger National Park) taken about every two years. It also mentions that the study used vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of sampling plots, from which training and validation points were collected.

It can be inferred that the raw data collection method used in this study involves aerial imaging and field observations, but the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified. The context does mention that integrating large-area historical datasets in land-use and land-cover analysis can serve as a resource to better understand long-term landscape changes, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting these datasets.
