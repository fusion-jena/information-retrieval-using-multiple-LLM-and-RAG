I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in landslide vulnerability assessment, but it does not provide information on the data formats used as input for these models. The context appears to be focused on landslide susceptibility mapping and the use of machine learning models, but it does not provide details on the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
