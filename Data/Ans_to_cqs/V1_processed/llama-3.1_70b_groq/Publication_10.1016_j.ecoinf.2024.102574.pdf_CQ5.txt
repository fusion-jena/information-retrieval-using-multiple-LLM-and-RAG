Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, geosciences, and environmental studies, with references to various papers on topics like LiDAR, UAV, and tree species classification.

The only mention of a dataset is in the context of UAV-derived DSM, DTM, and DOM datasets, but these are not related to the typical deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
