I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental studies in China. There is no mention of model training or performance monitoring strategies. The context seems to be focused on research papers and studies related to vegetation cover, land use, and climate change, rather than machine learning or model development. Therefore, I couldn't find any relevant information to answer the query.
