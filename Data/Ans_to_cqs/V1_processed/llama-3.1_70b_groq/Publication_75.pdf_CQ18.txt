The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the performance measures used to compare the retrieval performances of different networks, such as average retrieval precision (ARP), average retrieval rate (ARR), F-score, and mean average precision (mAP). However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
