Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and performance of various deep learning models for seagrass coverage estimation and object detection tasks. It discusses the architectures, techniques, and results of these models but does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection, as this information is not provided in the given context.
