Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context mainly focuses on the general process of training a deep learning (DL) network, the importance of annotated data, and the concept of generalization power. It also mentions the use of confusion matrices to present the results of the training sets, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
