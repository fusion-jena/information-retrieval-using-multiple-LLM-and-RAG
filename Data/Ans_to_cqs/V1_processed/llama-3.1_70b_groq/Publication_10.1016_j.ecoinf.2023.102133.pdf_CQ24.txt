The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of randomness in the construction of Random Forests (RFs) to increase their diversity and decrease their correlation.

In the context of Random Forests, randomness is introduced through the use of bootstrap sampling, where each decision tree is trained on a random subset of the data. This randomness helps to de-correlate the trees and reduce the model's variance without increasing its bias.

While this information is not directly applicable to the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that randomness can be a useful tool in machine learning for improving model performance and reducing overfitting.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide specific information on strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I do not have a more detailed answer to this question.
