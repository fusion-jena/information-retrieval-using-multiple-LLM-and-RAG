The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation during the training process, which can help improve the model's robustness and generalizability.

Specifically, the context mentions that the model was trained with default data augmentation, including scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation. This means that the model was trained on a diverse set of images, which can help it learn to recognize patterns and features that are not specific to a particular image or recording.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a large dataset of spectrograms, which were created by segmenting standardized recordings into 3-s clips. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse set of sounds, which can help improve its generalizability.

However, without more information, it is unclear whether other measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.
