Google Earth Engine.

The provided context mentions a research paper titled "Implementation of species distribution models in Google Earth Engine" by Crego et al. (2022). This suggests that the authors used Google Earth Engine as a platform to deploy their species distribution models, which may have included deep learning models. However, it is not explicitly stated that a deep learning model was used, but based on the context, it is likely that Google Earth Engine was the platform used.
