The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are typically large-scale datasets that are used for training and testing. These datasets are used to train and evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Some of the most commonly used datasets include:

* MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards, 1998): A dataset of handwritten digits images 60,000 images, used for training and testing handwritten digit recognition models.
* CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced of Advanced Research, 2004): A dataset of   color images, used for training and testing deep neural of object recognition models.
* Image 60.000 of images, used for training and testing deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
* ImageNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2009): A large-scale dataset of images, used for training and testing deep learning models, especially
especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models and to compare the performance of different models. They are provide a way to test the robustness of the models and to identify potential issues or biases in the models.
