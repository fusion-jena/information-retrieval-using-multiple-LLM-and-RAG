Several techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, including:

1. Batch Normalization:: This technique is used to normalize the input data. It is applied after the convolutional and ReLU layers.

2. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Activation Function: This is an activation function that introduces non-linearity in the model. It is used in the hidden layers of the deep learning pipeline.

3. SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent): This is an optimization technique used to train the the deep model. It is used to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting the model parameters.

4. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation): This is an optimization algorithm used to update the model parameters the data. It is used to adaptively to the data and make predictions of the model.

5. Batch Normalization is applied after the convolutional and ReLU layers.

6. Dropout: This is a hyperparameter that controls to be learned during training. It is used to control the the model's output.

7. Adam: is used to introduce non-linearity in the model.
