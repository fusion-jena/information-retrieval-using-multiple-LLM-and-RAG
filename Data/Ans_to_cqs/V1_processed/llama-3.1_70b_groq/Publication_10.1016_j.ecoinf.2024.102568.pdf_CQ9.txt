I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide links to two repositories: https://codeocean.com/capsule/0864495/tree and https://github.com/ChiaraBachechi/AQCalibrationFramework, but it does not specify if these are the data repositories for the deep learning pipeline.
