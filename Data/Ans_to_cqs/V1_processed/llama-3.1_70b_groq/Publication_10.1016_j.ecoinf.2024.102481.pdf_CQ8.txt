I don't know. The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or any specific platform where it is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). The context appears to be a research article discussing the application of machine learning techniques to classify maturity in Chilean hake, but it does not provide information about the code repository.
