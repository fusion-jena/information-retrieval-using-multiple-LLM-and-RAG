The text does not explicitly mention the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, it does mention that the HuggingFace implementations of ViT and ResNet were used for fine-tuning, which suggests that the Transformers library by HuggingFace is used, and this library is built on top of PyTorch. Additionally, the Keras implementation of Inception-V3 is mentioned, which suggests that Keras (which can run on top of TensorFlow) is also used.
