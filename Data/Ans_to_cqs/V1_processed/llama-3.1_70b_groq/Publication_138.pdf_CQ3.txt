Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of various deep learning models, including LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and others. It discusses the layers, filters, and activation functions used in these models, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
