Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context primarily discusses the application of deep learning methods, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), in time-series prediction and air pollution analysis. It also references various research papers and studies but does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to implement these models.
