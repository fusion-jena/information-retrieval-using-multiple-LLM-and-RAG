Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that analyzing historical trends in water quality is necessary to find the most variable and representative scenarios useful for machine learning model training. This suggests that the selection of training data subsets is based on the variability and representativeness of the data, but the specific criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets are not specified.
