The provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model, but it does discuss an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. According to the context, the ANN model has two hyperparameters: "size" and "decay". The "size" hyperparameter refers to the number of units in the hidden layer, and the "decay" hyperparameter is a regularization parameter used to avoid overfitting. The values for these hyperparameters were passed as arrays of 1-20 and 0.025-1, respectively. Additionally, the context mentions that the weights were randomly initialized using the Nguyen-Widrow method, and the Transfer/Activation function used was the logistic function. However, it does not mention the learning rate or optimizer used in the model.
