The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as an efficient way to increase the F1 score. Data augmentation can be considered a technique to address data bias by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset and providing more diverse examples for the model to learn from.

Specifically, the context mentions that small changes in brightness and zoom can help improve results, but changing the range in height and width can cause degradation of results. This suggests that the data augmentation techniques used in this context are limited to certain types of transformations.

Other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are not mentioned in the provided context. Diverse data collection is mentioned as a challenge in identifying specific vegetation mixed with native vegetation from UAV flights, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique mentioned that can be related to addressing data bias is data augmentation, specifically through small changes in brightness and zoom.
