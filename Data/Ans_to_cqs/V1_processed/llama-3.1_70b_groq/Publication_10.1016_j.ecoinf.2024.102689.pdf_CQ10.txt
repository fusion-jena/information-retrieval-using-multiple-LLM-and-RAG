I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the programming language (Python 3.6), the deep learning framework (PyTorch version 1.8.0), and the virtual environment (Anaconda3), but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
