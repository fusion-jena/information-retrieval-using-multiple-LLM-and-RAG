Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on the application of big-data mining approaches and Artificial Intelligence models to predict biodiversity changes and study climate change implications on biodiversity conservation, particularly in fragile ecosystems like wetlands. It does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
