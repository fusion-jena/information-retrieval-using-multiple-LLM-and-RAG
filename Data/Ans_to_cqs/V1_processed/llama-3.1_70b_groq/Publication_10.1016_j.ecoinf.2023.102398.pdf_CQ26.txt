Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, particularly the squeeze-and-excitation block, and the performance metrics used to evaluate the model. It also discusses the training process, including the use of optimized hyperparameters and a gradually increasing training cycle to avoid overfitting and biased training.

However, it does mention that the size of the dataset used for custom training is sufficiently large, which could potentially help mitigate data bias issues. Additionally, the context notes that the model is tuned with optimized hyperparameters to prevent overfitting and underfitting situations, but it does not provide further details on how data bias is addressed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
