The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to predict the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and the Significant Wave Height (SWH) for the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset. The employed deep learning model combines the gated recurrent units (GRU) with a regular neural network to efficiently anticipate the marine features.
