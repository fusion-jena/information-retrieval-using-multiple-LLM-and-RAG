The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the Species Distribution Models (SDMs) in the provided context are:

1. Sensitivity
2. Specificity
3. True Skill Statistic (TSS)
4. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC)

These metrics are used to quantitatively assess the performance of the SDMs in classifying given environmental variables at presence and absence locations. The AUC and TSS metrics are also used for the objective comparison of the performances of the SDMs, with threshold values ranging from 0 to 1.
