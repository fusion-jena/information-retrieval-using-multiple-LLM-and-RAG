The provided context mentions several methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Sentinel-2 optical images: These images are used as input data for the deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) to create high-resolution CHM (Canopy Height Model) of the Earth.
2. GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) data: GEDI data is fused with Sentinel-2 images using a deep learning algorithm to create a more spatially precise CHM.
3. Landsat 8 OLI imagery: This imagery is used in conjunction with GEDI data and phenology metrics to compute and derive a global forest canopy height map (Potapov30m) at 30 m spatial resolution.
4. Spectroscopy data: This data is used in a simulated wetland community to test the spectral diversity hypothesis (Heumann et al., 2015).
5. Aerial imagery: High-resolution aerial imagery is co-registered with low-density lidar data to improve measurement of forest structural parameters (Huang et al., 2009).
6. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data: These data are fused to model GEDI-derived vegetation structure characteristics in the Paraguayan Chaco (Kacic et al., 2021).

These methods suggest that the deep learning pipeline utilizes a combination of satellite and aerial imagery, as well as sensor data, to collect raw data for training and testing machine learning models.
