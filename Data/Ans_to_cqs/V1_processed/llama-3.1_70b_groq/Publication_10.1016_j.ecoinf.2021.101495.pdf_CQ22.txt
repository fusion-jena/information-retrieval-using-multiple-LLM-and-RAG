Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text mentions that the model is able to learn in fewer steps and with better accuracy if data augmentation is used, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of evaluation metrics.

However, it can be inferred that accuracy is one of the metrics used, as it is mentioned in the context. Additionally, the text mentions that the model is able to learn in fewer steps, which suggests that the training time or convergence rate may also be an important metric. But without further information, it is not possible to provide a complete list of evaluation metrics used.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions a "Ground truth validation" section, which suggests that the model's performance may be evaluated against a ground truth or reference dataset. However, the specific metrics used for this evaluation are not mentioned.
