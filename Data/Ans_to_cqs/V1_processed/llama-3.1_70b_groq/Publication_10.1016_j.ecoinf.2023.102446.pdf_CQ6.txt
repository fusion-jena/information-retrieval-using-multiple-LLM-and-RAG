Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research study on carbon uptake by vegetation and ecosystem productivity, and does not discuss deep learning or machine learning at all. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
