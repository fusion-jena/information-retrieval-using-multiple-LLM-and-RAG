The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the training data were generated as batches of sub-images that were "randomly cropped out from the original satellite images." This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data generation process, but the specific strategies used to handle this randomness are not mentioned.

The context does mention the use of techniques such as batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), which can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process. However, these techniques are not directly related to handling randomness in the data generation process.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the question about the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
