Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It does mention that the model uses stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation, which is an optimization algorithm, but it does not provide further details on the hyperparameters.
