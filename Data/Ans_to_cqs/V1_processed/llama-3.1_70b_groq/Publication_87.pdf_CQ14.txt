Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to data preprocessing, model evaluation, and transferability, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
