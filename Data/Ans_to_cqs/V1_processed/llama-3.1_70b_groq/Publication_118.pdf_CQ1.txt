Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the dataset, network architecture, and data pre-processing, but does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the given context.
