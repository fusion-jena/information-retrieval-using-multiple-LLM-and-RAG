The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is model validation using a validation data set. According to the text, "We evaluated the model performance on the validation data set... by calculating model accuracy as the number of correct predictions divided by the number of all images as well as precision, recall and F1 score for each class." This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation data set during training, allowing for the assessment of its accuracy and other metrics.
