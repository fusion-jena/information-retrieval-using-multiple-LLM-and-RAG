I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to image and data curation, metadata fields, and ecological monitoring, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
