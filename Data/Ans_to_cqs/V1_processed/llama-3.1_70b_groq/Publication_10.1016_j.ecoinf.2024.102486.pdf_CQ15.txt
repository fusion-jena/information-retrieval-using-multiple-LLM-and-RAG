Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the use of GPUs in ecology, machine learning, and deep learning, as well as various software tools and libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of cuDNN (Chetlur et al., 2014), which is a library for deep neural networks that provides optimized implementations of various algorithms, including those for training and inference. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Keras (Chollet et al., 2015), which is a high-level neural networks API that provides various optimization algorithms, including SGD and Adam, as part of its implementation.

But, without explicit mention of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
