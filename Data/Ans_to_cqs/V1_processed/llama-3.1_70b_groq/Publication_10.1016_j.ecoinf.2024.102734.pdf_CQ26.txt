The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset has an 80/20% training-validation split, which suggests that the data is split into training and validation sets, but it does not provide information on how the split is done (e.g., stratified splitting).

Additionally, the context mentions that the distribution of target features to non-target features in the test dataset is representative of the true distribution post-segmentation, which suggests that the data is representative of the real-world scenario. However, it does not provide information on whether any techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
