The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the convolutional neural network (CNN), is for bat calls detection and classification. According to the context, Paumen et al. (2021) developed and tested a method based on CNNs for detecting and classifying bat calls. The model is designed to identify and classify bat species based on their echolocation signals.
