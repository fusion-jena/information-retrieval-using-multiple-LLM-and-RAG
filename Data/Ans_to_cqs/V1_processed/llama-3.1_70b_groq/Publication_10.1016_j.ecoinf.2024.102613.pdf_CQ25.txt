Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for tasks such as classification, regression, or other machine learning tasks.

In the context of the provided text, Zhang et al. (2024) used a deep neural network for fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation. This suggests that the deep learning model is used for tasks such as estimation or prediction.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely for tasks such as estimation or prediction, but the exact purpose is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

If more information was available, a more specific answer could be provided.
