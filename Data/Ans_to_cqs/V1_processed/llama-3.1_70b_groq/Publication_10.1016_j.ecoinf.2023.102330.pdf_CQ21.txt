Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a research study on Northern bobwhite density estimation using distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture methods.

The context discusses the study area, empirical data, and various statistical models, including a cue rate sub-model and a spatial capture-recapture (SECR) model. It also mentions the calculation of bias and precision using root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation (CV), respectively.

However, it does not provide any information about machine learning model training or postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query.
