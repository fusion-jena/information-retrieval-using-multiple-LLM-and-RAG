The provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model. However, it does mention several machine learning models, including LightGBM, XGBoost, and SVM, among others. For these models, the hyperparameters are listed in Table 4.

For LightGBM, the hyperparameters mentioned are:

* learning_rate
* max_depth
* num_leaves
* feature_fraction
* bagging_fraction
* bagging_freq
* n_estimators

For XGBoost, the hyperparameters mentioned are:

* n_estimators
* max_depth
* colsample_bytree
* min_child_weight
* subsample
* learning_rate

For SVM, the hyperparameters mentioned are:

* Cost (C)
* gamma
* epsilon

Note that these hyperparameters are specific to each model and are used to tune the performance of the model. However, the context does not mention a deep learning model, so it's unclear what hyperparameters would be used in such a model.
