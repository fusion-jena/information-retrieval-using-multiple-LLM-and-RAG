Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the research goals, methodology, and limitations of a study on groundwater-climate interactions in the GAB region, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
