Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly the use of VGG-16, ResNet, and the proposed SIAlex model, for image classification tasks. It also discusses the importance of balancing model complexity and performance, as well as the use of activation functions and structural design to improve model efficiency.

The context does provide information on the datasets used, which are available on Kaggle, but it does not elaborate on any data augmentation techniques that may have been applied to these datasets. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
