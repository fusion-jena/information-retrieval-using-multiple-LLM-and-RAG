The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or methods for collecting raw data for such a pipeline. However, it does describe a field study where water samples were collected from various locations. 

According to the context, the methods used for collecting raw data (water samples) include:

* Field campaigns conducted in November 2018, and January, April, and July 2019, under clear weather conditions except in July.
* Collecting surface water (0.5 m depth) using clean polyethylene bags.
* Transporting the samples to the laboratory for analysis.

The context also mentions that the samples were categorized into two groups: one for water quality parameter analysis and the other for CDOM and FDOM spectral analyses. However, it does not provide information on methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.
