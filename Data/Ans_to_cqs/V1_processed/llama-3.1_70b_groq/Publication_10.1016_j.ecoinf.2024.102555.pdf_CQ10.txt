I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to research papers on ecological informatics, vegetation change, and climate change, but it does not include any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
