Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization using the TPEBO algorithm for LSTM models, particularly in the context of carbon emission forecasting. It discusses the importance of hyperparameters, the TPEBO algorithm, and the optimization process, but does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
