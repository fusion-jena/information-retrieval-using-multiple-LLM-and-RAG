I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture of a deep learning model for image enhancement, including the use of Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA) modules, encoder and decoder blocks, and batch normalization and ReLU activation functions. It also reviews related work on image enhancement techniques and discusses the performance of the model on various datasets. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
