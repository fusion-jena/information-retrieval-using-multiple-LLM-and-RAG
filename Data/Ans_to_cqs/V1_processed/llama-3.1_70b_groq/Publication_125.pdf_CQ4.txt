The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Rotation: A 90-degree rotation range was applied to the images.
2. Zoom: A zoom range of 20% was applied to the images.
3. Shear: A shear range of 20% was applied to the images.
4. Horizontal shift: A shift range of 20% in width was applied to the images.
5. Vertical shift: A shift range of 20% in height was applied to the images.
6. Brightness: A brightness scale between 0.2 to 1.0 was applied to the images.
7. Horizontal flip: The images were flipped horizontally.
8. Vertical flip: The images were flipped vertically.

These techniques were used to expand the dataset and enhance the efficiency of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The data augmentation process retained the essential features of the images, as shown in Figure 6, where the pixels are rearranged but the features are preserved.
