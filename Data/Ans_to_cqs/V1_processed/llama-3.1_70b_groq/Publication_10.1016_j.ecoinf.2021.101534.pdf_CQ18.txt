Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text describes the model training process, including the use of YOLOv5s, data augmentation, and the hardware specifications of the workstation used for training. However, it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored or evaluated during the training process.

It is mentioned that the model was trained for 100 epochs, but there is no information on whether any metrics, such as accuracy or loss, were tracked during training to monitor the model's performance. The text does describe the model evaluation process in section 3.4.2, but this refers to the evaluation of the model on test datasets after training, rather than during training.
