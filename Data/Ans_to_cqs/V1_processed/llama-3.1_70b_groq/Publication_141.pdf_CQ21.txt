The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the use of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) generated heat maps to visualize the relevant characters for each of the three models. This suggests that Grad-CAM is used as a visualization tool to understand the model's decision-making process.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of accuracy and misclassified images, which implies that metrics calculation is performed as a postprocessing step. However, it does not provide information on the calculation of other metrics or the creation of a confusion matrix.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps that can be confirmed are:

1. Visualization using Grad-CAM generated heat maps
2. Metrics calculation (at least accuracy and misclassified images)

Other postprocessing steps, such as the creation of a confusion matrix or the use of saliency maps, cannot be confirmed based on the provided context.
