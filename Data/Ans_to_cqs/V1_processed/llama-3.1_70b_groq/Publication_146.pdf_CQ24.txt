Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text primarily focuses on the model training process, including the choice of optimizer (Adam), hyperparameter settings, and the use of a specific GPU for training. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the text does mention the use of data augmentation, which is a common technique used to introduce randomness and increase the diversity of the training data. This is mentioned in reference [18], but it is not explicitly stated that data augmentation is used in this specific study.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the question about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
