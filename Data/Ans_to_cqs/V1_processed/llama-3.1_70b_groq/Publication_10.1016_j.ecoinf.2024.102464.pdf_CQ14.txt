The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through a process of refinement involving several hundred independent simulations, where the parameter values are varied to optimize the model. Additionally, logistic regression analysis is conducted on 288 grids to derive the parameters x, u, and y. This suggests that the optimization process involves a combination of simulation-based methods and statistical analysis, but the exact details of the optimization algorithm used (e.g., grid search, random search) are not specified in the provided context.
