The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Batch size: 128
* Number of epochs: 150
* Dropout rate: 0.3
* Optimizer: ADAM
* Learning rate: 0.0001

These hyperparameters are used to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The ADAM optimizer is used to find the optimal weights in the neural network, and the learning rate of 0.0001 is used to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the network's predictions and the pre-labeled data.
