None of the provided context mentions the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context does mention the use of R, a programming language and environment for statistical computing, but it does not mention any deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
