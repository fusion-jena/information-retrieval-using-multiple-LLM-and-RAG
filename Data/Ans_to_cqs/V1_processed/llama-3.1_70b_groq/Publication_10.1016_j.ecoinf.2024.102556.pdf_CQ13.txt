Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the YOLOv7 model, the Deep SORT algorithm, and the Multiscale Feature-Extraction Network (MSNet), but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for training the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
