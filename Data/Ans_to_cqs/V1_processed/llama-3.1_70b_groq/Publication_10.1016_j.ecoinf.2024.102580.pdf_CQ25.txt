The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping, as well as object detection. Specifically, the model is used to identify and classify different substrate types, including vegetation, bare substrate, and "other" classes. The model is also used for object detection, such as detecting turtles in images. The semantic segmentation model is used to achieve an accuracy of 92% in identifying the substrate types, while the object detection model is used to detect up to 100 turtles in an image.
