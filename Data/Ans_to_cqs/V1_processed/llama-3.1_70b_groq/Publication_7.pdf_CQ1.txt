The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used, Benthoz15, consists of "expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas." This suggests that the raw data may have been collected through some form of field observation or survey, possibly involving experts in marine biology or a related field.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset contains images collected over a span of 3 years (2011 to 2013), which implies that the data collection process may have involved some form of systematic observation or monitoring. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a public dataset, ImageNet, which is a large-scale hierarchical image database. This suggests that the deep learning pipeline may have utilized pre-existing public datasets as part of the training process.
