Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and testing of various machine learning and deep learning models for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water. It discusses the data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context mentions the use of Python 3.7, Anaconda 3, and specific libraries such as sklearn and PyWavelets, but it does not discuss how the trained model was deployed or serialized. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
