The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the grid search approach used to optimize the hyperparameters of the machine learning model, specifically the Random Forest (RF) model. It mentions that the grid search exhaustively tested all possible combinations of the defined hyperparameter values and evaluated the model's performance using cross-validation techniques, with the goal of minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used to determine when the training process is complete. Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
