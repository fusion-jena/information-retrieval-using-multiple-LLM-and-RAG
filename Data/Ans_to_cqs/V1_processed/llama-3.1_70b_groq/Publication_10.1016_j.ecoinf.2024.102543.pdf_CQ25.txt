The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, specifically real-time object detection. This is evident from the context, which mentions the YOLOv8 algorithm, a popular real-time object detection system. The text also mentions the application of the model in scenarios that demand rapid detection, such as NBSB (not explicitly defined in the provided context, but likely referring to a specific object detection task). Additionally, the discussion of model size, performance requirements, and inference speed further supports the conclusion that the model is designed for object detection tasks.
