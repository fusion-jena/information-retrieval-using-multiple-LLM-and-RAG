The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is detection, specifically for automated cattle detection. The text suggests that future studies could evaluate the feasibility of using more sophisticated methods, such as convolutional neural networks or deep learning, for this purpose. Additionally, the context mentions that supervised machine learning algorithms have already proven to be effective for ungulate detection, implying that the deep learning model is intended for detection tasks.
