Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of reliable records that were accurately and directly observed in the field to improve species observation data from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF). This suggests that data quality and reliability are important considerations in the preprocessing stage.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of data mining algorithms for computational biology, which may involve techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to address class imbalance issues. However, this is not explicitly stated.

Stratified splitting is not mentioned in the provided context. Diverse data collection is mentioned as a means to improve data quality, but it is not clear if this is used as a technique to address data bias during preprocessing.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to give a definitive answer to the query.
