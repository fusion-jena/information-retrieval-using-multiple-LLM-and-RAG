Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the selection of hyperparameter values, the use of randomized grid search methods, and the evaluation of model performance using metrics such as R2, RMSE, and MAE. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process, including model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
