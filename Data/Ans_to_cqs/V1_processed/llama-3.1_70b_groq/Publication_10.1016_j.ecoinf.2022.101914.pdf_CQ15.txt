I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on ensemble modeling approaches, regression-based models, and machine learning models, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
