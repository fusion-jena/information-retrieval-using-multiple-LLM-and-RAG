Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that a study by Sun et al. (2020) used a Bayes algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in a random forest model of landslide susceptibility mapping. This suggests that at least in some cases, a Bayes algorithm may be used for hyperparameter optimization, but it is not clear if this is the case for all models or studies mentioned in the context.
