I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The text appears to be discussing the analysis of valve gaping data from sentinel organisms in the context of aquaculture and shellfish farming. It mentions the use of R 4.0.5 for data analysis, k-means clustering, and principal component representation, but does not mention deep learning or any related techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
