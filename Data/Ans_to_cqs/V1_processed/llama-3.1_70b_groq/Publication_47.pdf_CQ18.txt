The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. Specifically, the training set was split into a validation set, which was used to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. This process was repeated 5 times by shifting the validation set to ensure a robust evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, the model with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features was selected.
