The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a dropout value of 50% in the first three layers of the MLP model to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of regularization techniques to mitigate the effects of randomness in the model. Nevertheless, there is no specific mention of setting a random seed value or other strategies to handle randomness in the pipeline.
