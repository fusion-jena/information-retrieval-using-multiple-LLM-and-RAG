Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text mentions that high model accuracies were obtained for most of the target VTs (Table 4), but it does not provide further details on the evaluation metrics used.

However, it does mention that the accuracy assessment at the detailed classification level (Table 5) showed that certain classes were mapped with relatively high accuracies. This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Additionally, the text mentions that the classification of certain classes was strongly driven by EO-datasets and benefited from systematic integration of each class-specific optimised data-layers. This implies that the model's performance may be evaluated in terms of its ability to correctly classify different classes, but the specific metrics used to measure this are not specified.

Therefore, while accuracy is likely one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific metrics used, such as precision and recall.
