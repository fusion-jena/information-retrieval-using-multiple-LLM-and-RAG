The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a "training-and-test approach with stratification splitting" was used in the study. This suggests that the data was split into training and test sets using stratification, which is a technique that ensures the same proportion of each class or group is maintained in both the training and test sets.

Additionally, the context mentions that "100 different splits to the training-and-test set were given", which implies that the data was split multiple times using stratification, and the model was trained and tested on each split. This is a common technique used to evaluate the robustness of a model and to reduce overfitting.

However, the context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data, such as the proportion of data used for training versus testing, or whether a separate validation set was used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
