The context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that "Models were trained for 300 epochs and evaluated on the validation set after each epoch." This suggests that the training process is set to run for a fixed number of epochs (300), and the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set at the end of each epoch. The context does not provide information on whether the training process is stopped early based on a specific criterion, such as validation loss plateau.
