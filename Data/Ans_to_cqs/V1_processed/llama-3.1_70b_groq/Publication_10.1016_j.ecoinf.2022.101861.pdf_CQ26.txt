Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on bird species classification using machine learning, but it does not delve into the details of data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

However, it does mention the potential for geographical song variations affecting the detection of the Band-tailed Nighthawk in different areas, which could be a source of data bias. Additionally, it suggests that the creation of more advanced classifiers using machine learning or convolutional neural networks might be useful in future studies to reduce the number of sounds misclassified.

But, it does not provide information on specific techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection being used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this query.
