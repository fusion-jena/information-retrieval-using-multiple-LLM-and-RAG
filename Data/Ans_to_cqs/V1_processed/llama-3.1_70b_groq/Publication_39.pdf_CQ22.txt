The provided context mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, specifically in the context of object detection and action recognition tasks. The metrics mentioned include:

1. Average Precision (AP): This metric is used to evaluate the performance of object detection models. AP is calculated as the average precision at different IoU (Intersection over Union) thresholds, ranging from 0.50 to 0.95. Two specific AP metrics mentioned are AP0.50 (also known as the Pascal VOC metric) and AP0.75 (also known as the strict metric in the sense of COCO).

2. Mean Average Precision (mAP): This metric is also used to evaluate object detection models. mAP is the average AP across all classes.

3. Average Recall (AR): This metric is used to evaluate the performance of object detection models. AR is calculated as the average recall at different IoU thresholds, ranging from 0.50 to 0.95. Two specific AR metrics mentioned are ARmax=1 and ARmax=10.

4. Intersection over Union (IoU): This metric is used to evaluate the overlap between predicted bounding boxes or segmentation masks and ground truth bounding boxes or segmentation masks.

The context does not mention accuracy as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model's performance is evaluated using precision and recall, which are components of the AP and AR metrics.
