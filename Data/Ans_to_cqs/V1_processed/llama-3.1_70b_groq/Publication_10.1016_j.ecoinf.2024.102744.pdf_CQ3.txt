The provided context mentions that a manually annotated subset of images was used to train an object detection network (YOLOv5). The annotation process involved labeling each image with information regarding the image name, size, and the coordinates of each bounding box. This suggests that bounding box annotation was used as a data annotation technique in the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions that the annotation process involved identifying pollen-bearing bees and non-pollen-bearing bees, which implies that instance-level annotation was used. However, it does not provide explicit information on whether instance segmentation was used.

The context also mentions that the annotation process was iterative, involving manual verification to establish the ground truth bounding boxes. This suggests that the annotation process was carefully curated to ensure high-quality annotations.

Overall, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and instance-level annotation, but it is unclear whether instance segmentation was used.
