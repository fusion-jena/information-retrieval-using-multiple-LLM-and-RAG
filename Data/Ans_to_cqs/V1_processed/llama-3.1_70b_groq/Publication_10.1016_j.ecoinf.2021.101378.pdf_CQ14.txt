Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF) and Maxent, for predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

The context mentions that the authors developed an ensemble model by integrating the RF and Maxent models, which showed improved predictive power compared to the individual models. However, it does not provide details on how the hyperparameters of the individual models or the ensemble model were optimized.

Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, and I cannot provide a more specific answer to this question.
