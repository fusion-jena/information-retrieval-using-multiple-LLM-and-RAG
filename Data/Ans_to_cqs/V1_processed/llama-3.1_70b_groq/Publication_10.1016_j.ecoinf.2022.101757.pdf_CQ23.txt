The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset with 121,408 images and 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. This suggests that the model was pre-trained on a large and diverse dataset, which can help improve its generalizability. Additionally, the text mentions that the model was used for inference without training it directly on the landscape photos, which implies that the model was not fine-tuned on a specific dataset, but rather used as a general-purpose model. However, it does not provide information on cross-validation or stratified splitting.
