The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is k-fold cross-validation. Specifically, the model was trained using 5-fold cross-validation (k = 5) with 500 epochs. This approach involves splitting the data into k different training-test sets and training the model on each split. The performance of each model is then evaluated, and the split with the highest mAP50 value is considered to have the highest number of correctly predicted labels. Additionally, the YOLO training losses and mAP50 values of each model were investigated to determine the best data split. This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance during training and helps to identify the optimal training-test split.
