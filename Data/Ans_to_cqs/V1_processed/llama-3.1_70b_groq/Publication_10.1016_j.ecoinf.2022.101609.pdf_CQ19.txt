The text does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it does mention the use of "fastai's library for tabular data" for predictive analytics, which suggests that the model may be built using the FastAI library, which is built on top of PyTorch. Additionally, the text mentions the use of "bayesian optimisation" for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the specific framework used for building the model.
