Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing image processing and acquisition, discussing topics such as image pre-processing, geometric and radiometric corrections, and the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for image analysis. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
