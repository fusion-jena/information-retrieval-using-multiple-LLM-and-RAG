Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on the development and testing of a bat calls detection and classification method based on convolutional neural networks, but it does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of machine learning and convolutional neural networks, which often employ optimization techniques like SGD or Adam to update the model's parameters during training. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of these techniques in the provided context, it is impossible to confirm their use in this specific pipeline.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
