Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the rapid growth of artificial intelligence and deep learning methods could contribute to larger data input for future training of deep learning models. This suggests that the collection of raw data is an important aspect of the deep learning pipeline, but the specific methods used are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of pre-trained models such as VGGish and BirdNET, which were trained on large datasets such as the YouTube-8 M dataset. This implies that these models were trained on existing datasets, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected for these datasets.

Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
