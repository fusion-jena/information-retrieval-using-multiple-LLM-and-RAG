Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the applications of deep learning, species distribution models, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of pooling layers, specifically Max Pooling and Global Average Pooling, which can help reduce the dimensionality of feature maps and achieve translation invariance. But it does not provide information on other data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
