Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the importance of field data in smart farming, the use of various analysis techniques, and the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in agriculture. It also discusses the limitations of traditional data management systems and the need for advanced data management systems.

While the context mentions the use of deep learning techniques, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
