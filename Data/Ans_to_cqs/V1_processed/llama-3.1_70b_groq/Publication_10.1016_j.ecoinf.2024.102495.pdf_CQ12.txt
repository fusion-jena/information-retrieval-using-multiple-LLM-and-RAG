The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the text as "CNN represents an algorithm type or neural network model commonly used to process two or more dimensions of data with high complexity, such as images or sound data". Additionally, the text provides details about the architecture of the CNN, including the feature extraction layer and the fully connected layer, which further confirms that a CNN is the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
