I don't know. The provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. It discusses various machine learning models, including XGB, SVR, and MLP, and their applications in data-driven earth system science, but it does not specify the purpose of the deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the use of these models for predictive modeling and performance evaluation, but it does not provide enough information to determine the specific purpose of the deep learning model.
