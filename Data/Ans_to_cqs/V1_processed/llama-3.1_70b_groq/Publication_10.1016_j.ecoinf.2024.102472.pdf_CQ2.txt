Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data, specifically multispectral and hyperspectral images. The context mentions the use of Landsat 8 multispectral sensor, Sentinel-2 spectral data, and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data, which are all types of remote sensing image data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of PolSAR (Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar) image classification, which is also an image-based data format.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV (Comma Separated Values) files may be used as input or output data formats, as they are commonly used in machine learning and data analysis tasks. For example, the context mentions the use of training data and expected values for error computation, which could potentially be stored in CSV files. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline appear to be primarily image-based, with a possible use of CSV files for data input/output.
