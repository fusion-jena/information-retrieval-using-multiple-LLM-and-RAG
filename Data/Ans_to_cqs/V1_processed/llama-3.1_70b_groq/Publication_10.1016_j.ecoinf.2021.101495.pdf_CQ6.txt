Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, hyperparameters, and computing infrastructure used for training neural networks for fish segmentation and classification tasks. 

However, it does mention a "Preprocessing of historical images" module in Figure 1, which is described in section 2.1, but the details of this section are not provided in the given context. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning models.
