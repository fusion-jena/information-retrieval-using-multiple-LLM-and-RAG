Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on soil moisture assessment in reclaimed mining areas using airborne laser scanning (ALS) and PlanetScope imagery. The study discusses the use of topographic indices, spectral indices, and volumetric water content (VWC) prediction, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If more context or information is provided, I may be able to provide a more accurate answer.
