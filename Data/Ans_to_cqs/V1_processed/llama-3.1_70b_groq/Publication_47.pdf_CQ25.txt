The purpose of the deep learning model, referred to as IUC-NN, is classification. Specifically, it is designed to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species. The model uses four groups of features (geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic) derived from digitally available occurrence records to make predictions. The model's primary goal is to automate the conservation assessment of orchid species, identifying areas with high extinction risk.
