The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to divide the dataset into two subsets: a training dataset (75% of the data) and a validation dataset (25% of the data). The model is trained on the training dataset and its performance is evaluated on the validation dataset. This approach allows for assessing the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting. Additionally, the performance metrics used to evaluate the model include adjusted R-squared (adj_R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance during training.
