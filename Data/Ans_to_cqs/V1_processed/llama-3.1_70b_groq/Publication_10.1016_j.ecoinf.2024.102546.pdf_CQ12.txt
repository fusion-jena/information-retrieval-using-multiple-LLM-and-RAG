The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the references and text, it can be inferred that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in some of the mentioned works.

For example, the paper "Precision chemical weed management strategies: A review and a design of a new CNN-based modular spot sprayer" by Allmendinger et al. (2022) explicitly mentions the use of CNNs. Additionally, the paper "DeepWeeds: a multiclass weed species image dataset for deep learning" by Olsen et al. (2019) and "TobSet: A new tobacco crop and weeds image dataset and its utilization for vision-based spraying by agricultural robots" by Alam et al. (2022) are likely to use CNNs for image classification tasks.

However, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline without more information. Other types of models, such as RNNs or Transformers, may also be used in certain parts of the pipeline, but this cannot be confirmed based on the provided context.
