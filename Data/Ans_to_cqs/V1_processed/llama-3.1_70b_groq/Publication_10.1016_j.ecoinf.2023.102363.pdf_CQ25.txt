The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to classify audio data frames into specified sound source classes. The model uses a pre-trained EfficientNet B0 network as a feature extractor, and then trains fully connected layers to classify the audio data. The model is fine-tuned on a new dataset from the Gulf of Mexico, with the goal of adapting the model to perform well in a new environment with limited re-training. The model takes spectrograms as input, which are transformed from raw audio data, and outputs a classification of the sound source.
