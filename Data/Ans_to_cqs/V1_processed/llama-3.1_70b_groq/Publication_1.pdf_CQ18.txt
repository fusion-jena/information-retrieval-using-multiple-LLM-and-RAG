The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the learning algorithm used is usually stochastic gradient descent, and the models are trained in a supervised fashion, where the desired output is provided for each input data sample. This suggests that the model performance is likely monitored through metrics such as loss or accuracy, which are commonly used in supervised learning. However, the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training is not mentioned in the provided context.
