I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the use of any specific cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be focused on data integration, data citation, and data repositories, specifically the ESS-DIVE repository and projects like AmeriFlux. There is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms, so I am unable to provide a specific answer to this question.
