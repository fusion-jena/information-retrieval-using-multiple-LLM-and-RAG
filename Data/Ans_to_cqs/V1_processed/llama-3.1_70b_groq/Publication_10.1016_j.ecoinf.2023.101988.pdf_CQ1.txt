Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are primarily related to wildlife surveys and bioacoustic recordings. Specifically, the context mentions:

* Point-count and observer surveys
* Line-transect surveys
* Automated bioacoustic recorders

These methods are used to collect data on species presence, abundance, and distribution in various habitats. The context also mentions the use of audio recordings, which suggests that audio data is being collected and potentially used as input for deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of RStudio, which is an integrated development environment for R, a programming language commonly used for data analysis and machine learning. This suggests that the collected data may be processed and analyzed using RStudio.

However, it is unclear if public datasets are being utilized in the deep learning pipeline, as there is no explicit mention of this in the provided context.
