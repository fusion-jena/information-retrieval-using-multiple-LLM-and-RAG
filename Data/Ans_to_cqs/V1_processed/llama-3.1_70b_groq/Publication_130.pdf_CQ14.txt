The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the model was retrained with a SGD optimizer and a learning rate 10 times smaller when there was no decrease in loss for more than 10 consecutive epochs. This suggests that some form of optimization was performed, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not mentioned.
