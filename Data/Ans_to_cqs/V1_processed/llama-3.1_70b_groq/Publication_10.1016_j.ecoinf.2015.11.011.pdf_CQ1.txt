Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the processing and analysis of imagery data, particularly in the context of ecological informatics. It mentions the use of historical imagery, aerial photo interpretation techniques, and machine learning techniques for segmentation and classification, but it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
