Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the calibration of deep learning models using a single parameter for all classes, post-processing techniques to improve classification accuracy, and the architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are typically performed before training a deep learning model.
