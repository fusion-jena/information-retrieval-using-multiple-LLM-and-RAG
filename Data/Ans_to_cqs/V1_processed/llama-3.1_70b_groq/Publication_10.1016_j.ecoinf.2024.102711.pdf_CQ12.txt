I don't know the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, but according to the context, AutoGluon utilizes methods like multi-layer stacking and neural network embeddings, which suggests that neural networks are part of the pipeline. However, the specific architecture of the neural network (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) is not specified in the provided context.
