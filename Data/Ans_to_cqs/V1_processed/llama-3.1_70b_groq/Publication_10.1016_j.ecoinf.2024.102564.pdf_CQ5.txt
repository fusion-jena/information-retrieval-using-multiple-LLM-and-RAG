I don't know. The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) in the context of ecological informatics, specifically modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It does not provide information on the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
