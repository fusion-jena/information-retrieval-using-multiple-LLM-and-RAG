The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some of the methods used for data collection might include:

* Sensors: The context mentions "Agri-IoT: A semantic framework for internet of things-enabled smart farming applications" which suggests the use of sensors in collecting data for smart farming applications.
* Cameras or computer vision: The context mentions "A vision-based counting and recognition system for flying insects in intelligent agriculture" which suggests the use of cameras or computer vision for collecting data on insects.
* Field observations: The context mentions "Insect classification and detection in field crops using modern machine learning techniques" which suggests that field observations might be used for collecting data on insects in field crops.

However, it is not clear if surveys or public datasets are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context does mention that some evaluations are performed using non-publicly available datasets, but it does not provide information on how these datasets were collected.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline might include sensors, cameras or computer vision, and field observations, but the exact methods used are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
