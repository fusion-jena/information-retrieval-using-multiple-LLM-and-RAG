The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models in the study.

According to the context, the performance of the models is evaluated using the R2 score (Eq. 17) and the modified R2 score based on the residual deviance (R2 DEV, Eq. 18). The R2 score is used to calculate the out-of-sample predictive performance, and the median out-of-sample R2 score is used as a more robust alternative to the mean. The R2 DEV score is preferred for species abundance counts.

Additionally, the context mentions that the out-of-sample prediction accuracy is calculated and the median of k-1 folds is taken to evaluate the performance of the XGBoost model.

It is not clear if these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model specifically, as the context does not mention deep learning models explicitly.
