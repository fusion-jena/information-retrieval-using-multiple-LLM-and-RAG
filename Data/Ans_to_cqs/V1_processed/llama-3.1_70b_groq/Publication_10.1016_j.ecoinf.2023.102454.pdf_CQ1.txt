The context provided does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the data sources used for the study. According to the text, the data sources include:

1. Nighttime lighting data from the National Earth System Science Data Centre (National Earth System Science Data Center, n.d.).
2. Provincial statistical energy data from the China Statistical Yearbook (China Statistical Press, n.d.).
3. Municipal statistical data from the Xi'an Statistical Yearbook (Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Statistics, n.d.).
4. Carbon emission factors for various energy sources from the "2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventory".
5. Administrative boundary data for Xi'an from the National Basic Geographic Information System.

These data sources are used to calculate CO2 emissions using a formula that takes into account energy consumption and emission coefficients. However, the context does not provide information on the methods used to collect the raw data for these sources.
