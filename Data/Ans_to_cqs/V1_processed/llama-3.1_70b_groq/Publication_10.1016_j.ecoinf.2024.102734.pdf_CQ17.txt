Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the comparison of different classification models (ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT), active learning techniques, and the evaluation of model performance on a dataset of possum vocalizations and noise sources. It does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
