Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the fine-tuning process, the use of a pre-trained model, and the iterative process to enhance the model's performance, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

However, it does mention that during inference, the patch size was set to 1024 Ã— 1024 pixels to accelerate the process, which suggests that the model was used for image processing and analysis. But the details of model serialization, platform selection, and deployment are not provided in the given context.
