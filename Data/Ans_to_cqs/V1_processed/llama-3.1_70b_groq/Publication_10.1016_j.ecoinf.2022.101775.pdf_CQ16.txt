The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the algorithms were trained for 100 epochs, suggesting that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of iterations, rather than based on a specific performance metric or convergence criterion. Additionally, it is mentioned that 10% of the data was used as a validation set to check for overfitting, but it does not specify how this validation set was used to determine the completion of training.
