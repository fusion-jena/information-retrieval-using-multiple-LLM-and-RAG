Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of Overall Accuracy (OA) and kappa in Table 5, which suggests that these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of classification accuracy in Fig. 12, which compares the growth rate of the overall classification accuracy of the satellite image models to the UAV image models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include:

* Overall Accuracy (OA)
* Kappa
* Classification Accuracy

However, it is not clear if other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. are also used to evaluate the performance of the model.
