The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention that the model uses a data augmentation method, specifically a 3-s window length, to "diversify the training data". This suggests that the model is using some form of data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data, which can help to address data bias. However, the exact techniques used to address data bias are not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model follows current best practices in deep learning, as summarized in (Chollet, 2017). This may imply that the model is using some form of data preprocessing or augmentation to address data bias, but the exact techniques used are not specified.

In summary, while the context mentions data augmentation as a technique used to diversify the training data, it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
