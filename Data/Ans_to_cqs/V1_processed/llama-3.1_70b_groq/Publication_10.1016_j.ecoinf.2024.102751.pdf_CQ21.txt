Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include metrics calculation. Specifically, the accuracy assessment of the developed model was performed using the 'yardstick' package for R, and the following metrics were calculated:

1. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
2. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
3. R2 (Coefficient of Determination)

These metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these steps were involved in the postprocessing of the model.
