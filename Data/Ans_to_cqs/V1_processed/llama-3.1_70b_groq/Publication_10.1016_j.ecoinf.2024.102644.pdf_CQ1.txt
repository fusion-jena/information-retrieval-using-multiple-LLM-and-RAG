The methods utilized for collecting raw data in this context are primarily based on public datasets and field observations. According to the provided text, the researchers used data from a public authoritative repository of big data, specifically the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which was improved with reliable records directly observed in the field. This suggests that the data collection methods include:

1. Public datasets: The researchers leveraged existing public datasets, such as GBIF, to gather species observation data.
2. Field observations: The researchers also conducted field observations to collect reliable records, which were used to improve the data from public datasets.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used as data collection methods in the provided text. However, it is mentioned that the researchers are planning a new data census and collection campaign, which may involve other public FAIR data repositories, such as those from the Tuscany Region administration or Copernicus.
