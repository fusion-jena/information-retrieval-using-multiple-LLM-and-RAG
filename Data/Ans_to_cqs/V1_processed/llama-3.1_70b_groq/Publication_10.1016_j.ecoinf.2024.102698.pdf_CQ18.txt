Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses the development and evaluation of surrogate models, data utility metrics, and the use of machine learning and neural network-based models. However, it does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.

That being said, the context does mention the use of metrics such as Ï‡2 test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, correlations scores, mean data quality score, and mean data diagnostics scores to evaluate the performance of the models. However, it is unclear whether these metrics are used to monitor performance during training or only to evaluate the final performance of the models.

Therefore, I do not know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
