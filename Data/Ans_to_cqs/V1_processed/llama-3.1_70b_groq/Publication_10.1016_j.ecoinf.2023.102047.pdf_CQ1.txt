The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data is collected from various sources such as satellite images (e.g., "WorldView-2" satellite images), underwater digital images, and possibly field surveys.

Some specific mentions of data sources include:

* Satellite images: Perez et al. (2020) used "WorldView-2" satellite images to map seagrass distribution.
* Underwater digital images: Moniruzzaman et al. (2019) used underwater digital images for seagrass detection.
* Field surveys: McKenzie (2003) provided guidelines for the rapid assessment of seagrass habitats, which may involve field surveys.

Additionally, some studies may have used publicly available datasets, such as the "LookingForSeagrass" dataset mentioned in Weidmann et al. (2019).

However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
