The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the challenges of using CNNs with limited training samples, the use of transfer learning, and the development of a mobile app for tree species identification. However, it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
