I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a study on land cover classification using different machine learning algorithms, such as MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF, and discusses the results of the classification using different window sizes and feature combinations. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
