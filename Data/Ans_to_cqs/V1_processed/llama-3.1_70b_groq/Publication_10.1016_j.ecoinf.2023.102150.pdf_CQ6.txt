According to the provided context, before training a deep neural network, the images were resized to 224 x 224 pixels. Additionally, image augmentation was applied to expand the training data set. The specific augmentation techniques used were shifts, horizontal flips, rotations, zooms, and shears. However, there is no mention of normalization or scaling in the provided context. It is also not explicitly stated whether any cleaning steps were performed, but it is mentioned that all training images should be reviewed manually to avoid misclassified training images.
