Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on semantic segmentation, image classification, and feature extraction, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques.

However, I can suggest that common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L2 regularization (also known as weight decay), and data augmentation. These methods are widely used in the field of deep learning to prevent overfitting, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

If you are looking for information on regularization methods, I would recommend consulting a deep learning textbook or a research paper that focuses on regularization techniques. The provided context does not provide enough information to answer your question.
