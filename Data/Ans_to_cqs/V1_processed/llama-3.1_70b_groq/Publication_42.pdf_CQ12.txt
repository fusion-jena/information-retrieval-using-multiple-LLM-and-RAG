The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions the use of various CNN architectures such as ResNetV50, InceptionNetV3, and customized CNN architectures. The text also discusses the performance of these models in terms of F1-score, learnable parameters, and hyperparameters, which further confirms the use of CNNs.
