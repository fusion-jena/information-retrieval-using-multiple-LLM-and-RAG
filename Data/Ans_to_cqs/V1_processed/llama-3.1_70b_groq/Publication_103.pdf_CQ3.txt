Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the implementation of a generic annotation system for schema-based data, specifically in the context of biodiversity collection data, and various deep learning techniques and experiments. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
