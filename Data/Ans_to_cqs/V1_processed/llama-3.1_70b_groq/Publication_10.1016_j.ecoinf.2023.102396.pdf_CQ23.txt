Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be from an ecological informatics paper discussing the variability of animal abundances across space and time, and it does not mention deep learning models at all. It lists various acronyms and initials, but none of them seem to be related to deep learning. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
