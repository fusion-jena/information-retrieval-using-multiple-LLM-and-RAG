I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on species distribution modeling (SDM) using machine learning models, specifically random forest and Bayesian models. It discusses the features used in the models, the model exploration process, and the challenges of collecting data for SDMs. However, it does not mention data annotation techniques or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
