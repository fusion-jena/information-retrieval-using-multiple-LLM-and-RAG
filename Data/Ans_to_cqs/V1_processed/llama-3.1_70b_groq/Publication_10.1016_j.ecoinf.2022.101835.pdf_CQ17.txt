The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention L1 and L2 regularization in the context of LightGBM hyperparameters, specifically `lambda_l1` and `lambda_l2`, which are set to 0 in the optimized model. This suggests that L1 and L2 regularization may be used in the LightGBM model, but it is not clear if they are used in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, dropout is not mentioned at all in the provided context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.
