Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning methods for forecasting ecological water demand in an arid oasis, and it discusses the use of LSTM models and SHAP values for feature importance. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
