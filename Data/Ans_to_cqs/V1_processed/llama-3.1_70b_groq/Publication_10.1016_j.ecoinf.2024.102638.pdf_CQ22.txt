The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used for other prediction models, which include:

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
2. Mean Square Error (MSE)
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
5. Mean Absolute Scale Error (MASE)
6. Coefficient of determination (R2)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of various models such as EN, KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, and MLP. However, it does not explicitly mention the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model.

If the query is referring to the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model mentioned in the context, the evaluation metrics used are likely to be the same as the ones mentioned above. However, without further information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, which are common evaluation metrics for classification problems. The context seems to be focused on regression problems, where the mentioned metrics are more commonly used.
