The purpose of the model is classification. Specifically, the model is used to predict suitable areas for different groups of orchids (lowland epiphyte, lowland terrestrial, upland epiphyte, and upland terrestrial) under current and future climate and land cover conditions. The model outputs a predictive map that classifies areas into unsuitable (0-0.6) and suitable (0.6-1) categories, with a threshold value of 0.6 derived from equal training sensitivity and specificity. The model is not used for segmentation or detection tasks.
