Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), discussing the use of Sentinel-2 data and atmospheric correction methods. It does not mention deep learning or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
