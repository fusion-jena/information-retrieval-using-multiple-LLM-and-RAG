I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that Seydi et al. (2022) demonstrated the utility of deep learning in extracting complex patterns from high-dimensional S2 satellite imagery, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used. The context also mentions that Montorio et al. (2020) utilized synthetic spectral databases created from linear spectral mixing, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query.
