The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the study uses a limited range of species and that future work will expand the number of classes in the model. It also references BirdCLEF2017, which suggests that the dataset may be related to bird species classification.
