Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, to various fields such as ecology and economics. It discusses the use of existing data, such as time series data, to train and test models, but does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
