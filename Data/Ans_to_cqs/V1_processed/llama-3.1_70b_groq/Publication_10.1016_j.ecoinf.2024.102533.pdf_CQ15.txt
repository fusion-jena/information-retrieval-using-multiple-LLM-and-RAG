Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper on fish freshness classification using machine learning and clustering techniques, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention the use of clustering algorithms, such as the Calinski-Harabasz criterion, and the calculation of silhouette values, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the deep learning models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
