I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be related to a research study on using a mobile app for marine species monitoring, where citizen scientists report sightings of specific taxa. The context discusses the app's features, data collection methods, and user feedback, but does not delve into deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
