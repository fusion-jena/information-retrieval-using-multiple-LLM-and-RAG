The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of a validation set, which is typically used to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust the hyperparameters accordingly.

It is mentioned that the dataset is split into a train set, validation set, and test set, with the validation set including 20% of the clips in each class. This suggests that the model's performance is likely being monitored on the validation set during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used for monitoring are not specified.
