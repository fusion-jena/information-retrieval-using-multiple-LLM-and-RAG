Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the theoretical aspects of the model, including the cost function, embedding layers, and variations of the proposed DMF model. It does not provide information on the practical implementation or the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
