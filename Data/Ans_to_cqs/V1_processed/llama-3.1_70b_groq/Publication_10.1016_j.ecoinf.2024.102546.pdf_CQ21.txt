Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the dataset curation, model architecture, hyperparameter settings, and training process. It does not provide information on what happens after the model is trained. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
