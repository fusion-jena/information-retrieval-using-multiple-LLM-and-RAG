Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the CNN hyperparameters configurations used for all four networks during training are shown in Table 1, but the table itself is not provided. Additionally, it mentions that minibatch gradient descent is used during training, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
