The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the researchers used "high-definition satellite images" to train a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect farm dams. This suggests that the raw data used in the pipeline consists of satellite images, but the exact methods used to collect these images are not specified.
