Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context only discusses the model training process, including feature extraction, model compilation, and fine-tuning. It then abruptly moves on to the "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION" section without providing any information on postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
