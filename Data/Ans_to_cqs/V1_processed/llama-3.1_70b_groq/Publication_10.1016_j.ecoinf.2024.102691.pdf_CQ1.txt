Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the model training process, network architecture, and attention mechanisms used in the YOLOv5 model, but it does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
