Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) for modeling and prediction tasks, but it does not delve into the specifics of regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
