The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is ImageNet. The text mentions that the RGB channels were normalized by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel to align the unsupervised classifications with the ImageNet pretraining weights. Additionally, the text mentions that the network was pre-trained on ImageNet data before being fine-tuned on the hand-annotated data. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets being used in the pipeline.
