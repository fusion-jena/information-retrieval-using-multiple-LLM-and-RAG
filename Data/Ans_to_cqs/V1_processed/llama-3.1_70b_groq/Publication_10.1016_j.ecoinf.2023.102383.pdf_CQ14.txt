Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the selection of feature maps, the use of hard negative mining, and the definition of bounding box regression, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
