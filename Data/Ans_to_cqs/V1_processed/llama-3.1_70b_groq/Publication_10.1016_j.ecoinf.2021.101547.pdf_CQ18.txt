The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the loss scores of the images in the mini-batch. The network performs a new round of learning on the mini-batch of images, focusing relatively more on images with higher loss scores, and updates its internal parameters before proceeding to the next training iteration. This suggests that the model is using a loss-based approach to monitor its performance during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used to evaluate the model's performance are not specified.
