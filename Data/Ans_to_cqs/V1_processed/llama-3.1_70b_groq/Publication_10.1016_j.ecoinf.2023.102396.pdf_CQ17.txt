Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be a snippet from a research paper on ecological informatics, discussing a dynamic programming equation (Equation 3) and mentioning something about "adding the estimation burdens." There is no mention of deep learning, dropout, or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
