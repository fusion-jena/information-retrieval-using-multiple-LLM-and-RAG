I don't know. The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest. It discusses dataset preparation, spectral indices calculation, and sampling strategies, but does not mention techniques for addressing data bias.
