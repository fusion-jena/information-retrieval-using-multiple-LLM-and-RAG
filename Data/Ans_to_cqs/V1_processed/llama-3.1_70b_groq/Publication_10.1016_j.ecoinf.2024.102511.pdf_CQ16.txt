Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the importance of automated classification routines, the potential use of BANTER for machine learning classification, and the challenges of determining species identity based on call characteristics. It also touches on the recommended approach for training data, particularly for species with small sample sizes, but does not delve into the details of training completion criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
