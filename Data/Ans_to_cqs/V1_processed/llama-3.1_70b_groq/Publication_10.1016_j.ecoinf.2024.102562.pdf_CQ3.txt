The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the model was partially trained to learn the data first and then used to annotate new data before training it further. This suggests that some form of semi-supervised or active learning approach was used, where the model was used to generate annotations for new data, which were then manually checked and edited by a human. This process allowed for the rapid preparation of a large dataset within a day.
