I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. It only mentions that the dataset used is a publicly available dataset in Roboflow (Roboflow Dataset, n.d) named Animal2-v1, but it does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is hosted.
