The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of LUCAS images, North looking images, and orthophotos, which suggests that the raw data may be collected through remote sensing or aerial photography. Additionally, the context mentions the use of topographic maps, which could be used as a source of data.

It is also mentioned that the study uses the Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) 2006 data, which is a European Commission dataset. This suggests that the study may be using existing public datasets as a source of raw data.

However, the context does not provide information on whether surveys or sensors are used to collect raw data. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the study likely uses remote sensing, aerial photography, and public datasets (such as LUCAS) as sources of raw data, but the use of surveys and sensors is unknown.
