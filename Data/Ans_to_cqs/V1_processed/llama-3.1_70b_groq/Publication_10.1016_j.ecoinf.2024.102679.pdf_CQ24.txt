To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the text mentions that the model was selected relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set, with a 50% probability of occurrence. This suggests that the model selection process involves some randomness, and the best-performing model is chosen based on its performance on the validation set. However, the text does not provide further information on how the random seed value is handled or if any other strategies are employed to manage randomness in the pipeline.
