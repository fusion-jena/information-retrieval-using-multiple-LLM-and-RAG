The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the ESK model proposed in the paper, is classification. The model is designed to classify fish from different families based on their DNA barcode sequences. The model preprocesses the original data, learns deep features using Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE), and then uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to select a threshold and classify the fish. The ultimate goal of the model is to correctly classify fish from different families, which is a classification problem.
