Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the use of Random Forest classification for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats, and mentions data acquisition, preparation, and the removal of non-vegetated and mixed pixels. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
