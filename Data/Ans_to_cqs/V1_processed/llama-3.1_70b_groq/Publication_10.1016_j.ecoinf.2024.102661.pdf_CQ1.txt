Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, for carbon emission forecasting and the use of the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization.

However, it can be inferred that the data used in the studies mentioned in the context might be obtained from various sources such as public datasets, as some of the references mention the use of historical global emissions data and agricultural production data. Additionally, some studies might utilize data from sensors or surveys, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If more context or information is provided, a more accurate answer might be possible.
