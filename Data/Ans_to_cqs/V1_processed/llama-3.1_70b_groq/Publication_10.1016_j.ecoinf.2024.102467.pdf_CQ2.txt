The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the text, it can be inferred that image data is used, as there are mentions of "image algorithms", "image size", and "feature extraction network" which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Additionally, the context mentions "high-resolution images" which further supports the use of image data.

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that image data is likely used in the deep learning pipeline, but the use of other data formats is unknown.

It's worth noting that the context is focused on computer vision tasks, specifically image classification and object detection, which is consistent with the use of image data. However, without more information, it's impossible to say for certain what other data formats might be used in the pipeline.
