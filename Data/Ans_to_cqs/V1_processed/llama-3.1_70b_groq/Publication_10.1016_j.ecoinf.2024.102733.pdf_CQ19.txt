Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text only discusses the architecture and parameters of the model, such as the use of Adam optimizer, Batch Normalization, and Focal Loss, but does not mention the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
