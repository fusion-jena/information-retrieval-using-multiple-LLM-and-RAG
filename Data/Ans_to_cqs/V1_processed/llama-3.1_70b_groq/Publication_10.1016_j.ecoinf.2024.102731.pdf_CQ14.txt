The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the optimization was performed using the L-BFGS-B method, which is a quasi-Newton approach that can resolve functions with simple constraints. This suggests that the optimization is done using a gradient-based method, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are specifically optimized (e.g., grid search, random search).
