The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention the use of the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) as a metric to evaluate the performance of a model. RTMSPE is used to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, removing the impact of heterogeneous observations.
