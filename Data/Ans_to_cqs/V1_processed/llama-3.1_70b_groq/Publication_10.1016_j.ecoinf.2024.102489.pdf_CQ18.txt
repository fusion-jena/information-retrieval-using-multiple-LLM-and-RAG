The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation. This is done through a grid search method (GridSearchCV) to search for the optimal parameters of the model. The OOB error is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, while the five-fold cross-validation is used to further assess the model's performance by splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is generalizing well to new data.
