Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter optimization task using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, and the use of SHAP values to identify the most salient predictors.

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is being evaluated and fine-tuned, which may involve calculating metrics and analyzing the confusion matrix. But the specific postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps, are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
