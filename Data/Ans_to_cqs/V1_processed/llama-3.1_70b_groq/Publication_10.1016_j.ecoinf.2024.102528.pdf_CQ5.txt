Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on bird species monitoring and image recognition using deep learning models, particularly the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model. It mentions a few research papers and studies related to bird species monitoring, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
