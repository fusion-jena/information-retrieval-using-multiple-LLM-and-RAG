Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on hyperparameter tuning for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and mentions various CNN models and their performance on different classification tasks. However, it does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
