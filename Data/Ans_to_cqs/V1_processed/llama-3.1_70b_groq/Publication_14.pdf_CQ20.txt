The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of CPUs for certain tasks. For example, feature extraction of the fixed inception layers was completed in 1 hour and 26 minutes on 15 CPUs, and model evaluation on the 70 test videos was completed in 4 hours and 38 minutes on 30 CPUs. Additionally, training of the new layers was completed in 27 minutes on a single CPU. It also mentions the use of Google Cloud DataFlow for parallel processing of feature vectors, but it does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the model.
