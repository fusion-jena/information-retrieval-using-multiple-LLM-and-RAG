Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for plant leaf recognition, disease detection, and classification of Indian medicinal plants. It discusses various studies and their approaches to developing and training deep learning models, but it does not provide information on the data collection methods used in these studies. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
