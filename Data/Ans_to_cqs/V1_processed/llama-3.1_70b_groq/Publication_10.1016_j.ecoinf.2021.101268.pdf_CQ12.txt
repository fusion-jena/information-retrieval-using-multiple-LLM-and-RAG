The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the pipeline employs pre-trained CNN models, including AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201, which are fine-tuned for plant species classification. These models are used to extract features from leaf images and classify them into different species. The use of CNNs is mentioned in the context as a suitable architecture for image classification tasks, particularly for disentangling high-level representations across multiple processing layers.
