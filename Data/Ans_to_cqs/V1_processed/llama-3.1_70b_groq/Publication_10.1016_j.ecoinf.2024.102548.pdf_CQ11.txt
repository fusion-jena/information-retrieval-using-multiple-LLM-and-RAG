I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects of the pipeline, including transfer learning, data augmentation, and the use of pre-trained models, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline itself is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
