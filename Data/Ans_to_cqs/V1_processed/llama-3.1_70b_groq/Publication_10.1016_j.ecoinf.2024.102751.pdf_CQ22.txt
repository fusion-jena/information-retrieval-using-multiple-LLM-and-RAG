The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the predictive model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the model in predicting Volumetric Water Content (VWC) values.

Specifically, the MAE value of 4.1% indicates that the prediction model deviates by 4.1% from the actual VWC values. The RMSE value of 5.6% is slightly higher than the MAE, indicating that it gives more weight to larger errors. The R2 value of 0.49 indicates that the model explains 49% of the variance in the observed VWC values, indicating a moderate ability of the model to capture the relationship between the explanatory variable and VWC.

Note that the query mentions a deep learning model, but the provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model. Instead, it mentions a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and suggests that more advanced methods such as machine learning or deep neural networks could be tested in the future to increase the accuracy of prediction.
