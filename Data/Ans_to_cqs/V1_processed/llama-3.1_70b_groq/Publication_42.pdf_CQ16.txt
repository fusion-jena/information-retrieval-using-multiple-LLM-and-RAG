The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention the use of validation F1-score to evaluate the performance of different models. The text also mentions that the authors achieved a high F1-score of 96.6% using transfer learning on ResNetV50, which suggests that the F1-score may have been used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the model during training. However, the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete is not specified in the provided context.
