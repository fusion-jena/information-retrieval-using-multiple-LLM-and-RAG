I don't know. The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be related to a package called "covsel" for covariate selection in species distribution modeling, and discusses algorithms and functions for filtering and embedding covariates, but does not mention data augmentation techniques.
