The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically a ResNet50V2 model. This is evident from the mention of "ResNet50V2 models" in Figure 8, which shows the recall of these models on the validation set as a function of the annotation size relative to image size. Additionally, the context mentions that the network models were trained on different image sizes and with different pooling methods (global max pooling or global average pooling) before the final classification layers, which is consistent with the architecture of a CNN.
