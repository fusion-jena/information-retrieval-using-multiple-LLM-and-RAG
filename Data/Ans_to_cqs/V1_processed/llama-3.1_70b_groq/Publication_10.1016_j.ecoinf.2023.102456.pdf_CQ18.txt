The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors use various metrics to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, balanced accuracy, F-measure, Cohen's kappa coefficient, and Matthew's correlation coefficient. These metrics are used to comprehensively assess the performance and effectiveness of the model, and to identify potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories. Additionally, the authors mention that they will present the evaluation results through the use of figures and numerical data, and that graphical visualizations will effectively portray the performance estimation achievement.
