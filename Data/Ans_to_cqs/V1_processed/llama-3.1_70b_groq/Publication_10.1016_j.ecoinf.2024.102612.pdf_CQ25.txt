The purpose of the deep learning (DL) model in the provided context is semantic segmentation and classification, specifically for fuel model retrieval. The model is trained to classify different vegetal species and retrieve fuel models from point clouds, such as those obtained from LiDAR or MS imagery. The model is designed to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data, making it suitable for handling high-dimensional data from MS geoinformation. The ultimate goal of the model is to provide accurate predictions and classifications of fuel types, which can be useful in various applications such as forestry management and wildfire risk assessment.
