Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few datasets and image collections used in various studies and experiments.

For example, it mentions a dataset of 700 aerial images of whales, with 945 annotated bounding boxes, used for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for object detection. Additionally, it references several studies that used deep neural networks for image classification and object detection, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in those studies.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
