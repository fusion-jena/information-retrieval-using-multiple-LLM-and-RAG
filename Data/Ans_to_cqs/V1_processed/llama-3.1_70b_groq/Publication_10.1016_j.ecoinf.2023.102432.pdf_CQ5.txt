I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and machine learning for classification, specifically for detecting invasive species using multispectral airborne and satellite imagery. The datasets mentioned in the context are NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat 8 imagery, which are used for training and testing machine learning models, but they are not typical deep learning datasets.
