The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the model was pre-trained on the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014). The training data used in this specific study includes 8 shark species and 19 non-shark species commonly associated with sharks on baited underwater videos. The images were transformed from video clips at a rate of 1 frame per second, and the sharks and non-shark species were annotated with bounding boxes, resulting in 26,947 fish annotations.
