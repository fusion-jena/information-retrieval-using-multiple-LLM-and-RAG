Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context only mentions the program "STARdbi_split_images" which is used to split images, but it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it is mentioned that the output of "STARdbi_split_images" is used as input for "STARdbi_train", which trains a classification model. This suggests that the data splitting is likely done as part of the "STARdbi_split_images" program, but the specific criteria used for splitting the data is not provided.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
