I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of different classification algorithms, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It mentions that the random forest algorithm is used to select the most important variables, but it does not elaborate on the hyperparameter optimization method used.
