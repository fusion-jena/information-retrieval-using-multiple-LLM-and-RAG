Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on a study that employs the HRNet model for semantic segmentation of social media images, specifically for analyzing the built environment of traditional villages in Fuzhou City, China.

However, it does mention that the study uses image datasets obtained from Dianping, Ctrip, and Weibo platforms, which are then organized and quantified using semantic segmentation based on HRNet and image complexity calculation based on Matlab. The study also uses a training set and a test set for constructing an XGBoost model, but it does not specify the specific datasets used for training or testing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
