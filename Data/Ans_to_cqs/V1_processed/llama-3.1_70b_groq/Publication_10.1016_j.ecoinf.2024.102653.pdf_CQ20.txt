I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. It only discusses the hyperparameters used for training the Recurrent Neural Network model, the performance metrics used to evaluate the model, and the methodologies used for data collection, model training, and validation.
