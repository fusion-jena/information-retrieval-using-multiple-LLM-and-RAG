Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in remote sensing and image classification. It discusses the training process, loss functions, and existing works in the field, but does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is likely to be remotely-sensed images, possibly obtained from satellites or aerial vehicles. The context mentions the use of high-resolution multi-band imagery and hyperspectral scenes, which suggests that the data may be collected using sensors or cameras mounted on these platforms.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of well-known annotated datasets, such as the Pavia University image and the Indian pines image, which suggests that public datasets may also be used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not mentioned in the provided context.
