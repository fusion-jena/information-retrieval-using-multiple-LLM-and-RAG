The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

- Batch size: 20 images
- Optimizer: RMSprop
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Learning rate decay: 0.0001
- Loss function: Mean squared error

These hyperparameters were used for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in the study.
