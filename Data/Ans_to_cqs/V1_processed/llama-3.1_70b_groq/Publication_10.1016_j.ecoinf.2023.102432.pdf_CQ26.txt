Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of using machine learning algorithms for ecology and conservation applications, particularly when dealing with imperfect training data.

However, it does mention that most machine learning approaches are not designed to handle training data that is not 'pure' or 100% representative of the target invader. It also highlights the challenges of matching training data collected in the field or high spatial resolution imagery to pixels in the target imagery.

The context does introduce MTMI-SMF, a method that is formulated to work with imperfect data, which can be due to training locations having locational errors or not ideally matching with image pixels. MTMI-SMF groups pixels surrounding a training location that could have an invader, which can help to mitigate some of the issues related to imperfect data.

But, it does not provide information on specific techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection that are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
