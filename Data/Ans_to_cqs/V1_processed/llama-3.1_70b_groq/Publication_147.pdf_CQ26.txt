Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the comparison of shallow learning (XGBoost) and deep learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) methods for wetland classification, as well as the use of various indices and features as inputs to the models. It does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing or techniques used to address data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of photo-interpreted validation data and field validation data to evaluate the performance of the models. This suggests that the authors may have taken steps to ensure that the data used for training and validation was representative of the wetland classes being modeled. Nevertheless, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
