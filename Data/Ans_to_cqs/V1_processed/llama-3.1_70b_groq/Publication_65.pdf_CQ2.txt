The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image data. 

The context mentions the use of input patch sizes of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, which suggests that the data is in the form of images. Additionally, the context discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and architectures such as U-Net, SegNet, and DeepLabV3+, which are commonly used for image processing tasks. 

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pipeline likely involves image data, but the exact format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) is not specified.
