Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the experimental design, network architecture, and evaluation indices of a specific deep learning model, YOLOv8. 

However, it does mention the input image resolution being set at 640 Ã— 640, which suggests that the input images may have been resized to a uniform size before training. Additionally, the context mentions the use of batch normalization (BatchNorm2d) in the network architecture, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer. 

But, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.
