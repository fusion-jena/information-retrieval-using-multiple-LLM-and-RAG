The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

According to Table 4, the equations and definitions for these metrics are as follows: 

- Accuracy: TP + TN / TP + FP + TN + FN (proportion of correct predictions in the whole data set)
- Precision: TP / TP + FP (proportion of images that a model classified as a specific category C that are actually category C)
- Recall: TP / TP + FN (proportion of images that are actually a specific category C that the model classified as C)
- F1 score: 2*precision*recall / precision + recall (weighted average of precision and recall)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the image quality model on the test data, as shown in Table 5. The table provides the precision, recall, and F1 score for the model in different locations (Finnmark and Yamal) and for different image qualities (bad and good).
