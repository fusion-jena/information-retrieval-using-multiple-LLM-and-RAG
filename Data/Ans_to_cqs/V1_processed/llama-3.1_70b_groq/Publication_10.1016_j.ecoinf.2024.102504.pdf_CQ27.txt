Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and studies related to air quality, pollution, and environmental science, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a specific deep learning model.

However, one of the papers mentioned, "Navares, R., Aznarte, J.L., 2020. Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models," discusses the use of deep learning models for predicting air quality, but it does not provide details on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
