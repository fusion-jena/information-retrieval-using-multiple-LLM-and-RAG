Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental studies, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

However, I can suggest that the context might be related to studies that use remote sensing data, such as satellite images, to analyze environmental phenomena like vegetation changes, flood susceptibility, and burned area mapping. In such cases, data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or semantic segmentation might be used to label the data for training deep learning models. But without more specific information, I cannot provide a definitive answer.

If you have any more context or clarification on the specific study or paper you are referring to, I might be able to provide a more accurate answer.
