Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for processing multidimensional data and mentions satellite-based observations, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this study.
