Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model efficiency was 23.1 minutes on the "same machine used in previous models", but it does not provide information about the type of machine or hardware resources used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
