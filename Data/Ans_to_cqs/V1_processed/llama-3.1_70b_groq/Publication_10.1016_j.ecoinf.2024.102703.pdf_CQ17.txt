The provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) model for variable selection and statistical regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model. This suggests that LASSO is being used as a regularization technique in this specific study.

However, it does not provide information on other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I can only confirm that LASSO is being used as a regularization technique in this study, but I do not have information on other methods that might be used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
