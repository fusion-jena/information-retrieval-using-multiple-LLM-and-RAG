The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) cross-validation. This means that the data is split into five folds, and each fold is used as a test set while the remaining four folds are used as a training set. This process is repeated five times, with each fold being used as a test set once. The subject-exclusive criterion ensures that the same subject does not appear in both the training and testing sets at the same time.
