Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the use of data augmentation to improve class balance and the performance of different deep learning networks, including ConvNeXt and ResNet. It also provides a general overview of deep learning approaches and their applications. However, it does not delve into the specifics of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
