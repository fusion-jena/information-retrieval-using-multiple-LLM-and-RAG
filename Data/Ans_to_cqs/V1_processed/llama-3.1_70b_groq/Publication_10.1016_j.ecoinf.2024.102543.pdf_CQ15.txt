Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the YOLOv8 architecture, its variants, and modifications, as well as data preprocessing and augmentation techniques. It does not provide information on the optimization algorithms used for training the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the given context.
