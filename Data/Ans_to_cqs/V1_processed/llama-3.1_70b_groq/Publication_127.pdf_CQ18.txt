The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the models were trained and then evaluated on a test set of 105,000 images. The performance of the models is reported in terms of top-1 accuracy, which suggests that the models were evaluated on their ability to correctly classify images as containing animals or not. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the models were trained on a large dataset of 1.4 million images and that the labels for each capture event were assigned to all the images in that event. This suggests that the models were trained on a large and potentially diverse dataset, which can help to improve their performance. However, the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training is not mentioned.
