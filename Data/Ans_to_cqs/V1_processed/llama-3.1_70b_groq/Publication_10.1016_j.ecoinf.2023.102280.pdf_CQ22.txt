The provided context does not mention traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Instead, it mentions three metrics that are specifically used to evaluate the performance of noise reduction methods in audio enhancement:

1. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SnNR): This metric is calculated as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power in the original and denoised signals.
2. Success Ratio (SR): This metric measures the change in variance of the original and denoised signals, with a higher value indicating better denoising performance.
3. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR): This metric is the ratio between the maximum signal power and the noise floor, described by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original and denoised signals.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the Conformer-Based Metric Generative Adversarial Network (CMGAN) model, as well as traditional noise reduction methods such as spectral subtraction and Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD).
