Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only discusses the architectures and techniques used, such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), but does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
