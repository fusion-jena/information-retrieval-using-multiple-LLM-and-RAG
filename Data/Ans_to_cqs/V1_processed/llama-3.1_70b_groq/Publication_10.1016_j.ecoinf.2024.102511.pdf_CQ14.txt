Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that "small values of sampsize were selected to improve computational performance, but large values of ntree were used to obtain models with stable classification results" (Rankin and Archer, 2021), suggesting that some hyperparameter tuning was done, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
