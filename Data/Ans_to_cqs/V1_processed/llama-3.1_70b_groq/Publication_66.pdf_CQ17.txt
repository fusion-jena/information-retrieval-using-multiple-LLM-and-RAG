Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically H2O, for predicting diving locations of seabirds, but it does not provide information on the regularization techniques employed. It mentions the use of a random hyperparameter search to determine the optimum model structure, but it does not specify the regularization methods used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
