I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their types (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) at all. The context appears to be related to data collection, processing, and metadata standards for environmental data, specifically in the context of ecological research and earth system science. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning models, so I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
