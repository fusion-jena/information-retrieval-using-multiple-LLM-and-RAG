Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on various deep learning architectures, such as Inception-v4, ResNet, YOLOv5, and transformer meets convolutional neural network, as well as their applications in plant disease classification, wildlife conservation, and object detection.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to apply data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's robustness to different orientations and scales.

Some of the papers mentioned in the context, such as "Dense convolutional neural networks based multiclass plant disease detection and classification using leaf images" and "Wild animal detection from highly cluttered images using deep convolutional neural network", may have applied data augmentation techniques, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
