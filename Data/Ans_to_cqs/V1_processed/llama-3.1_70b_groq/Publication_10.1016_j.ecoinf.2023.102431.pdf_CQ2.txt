The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline or the specific data formats used in such a pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the study uses camera trap images and track data (collected using FIT) to create a reference dataset for identifying species and sex. The data formats mentioned in the context are:

* Camera trap images (used to create a reference dataset)
* Track data (collected using FIT and geo-referenced using 7 landmark points)
* Morphometric variables (124 distances, angles, and areas extracted from the track data)

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the study. Additionally, while CSV is not explicitly mentioned, it is possible that the data is stored or analyzed in a CSV format, but this is not confirmed in the provided context.
