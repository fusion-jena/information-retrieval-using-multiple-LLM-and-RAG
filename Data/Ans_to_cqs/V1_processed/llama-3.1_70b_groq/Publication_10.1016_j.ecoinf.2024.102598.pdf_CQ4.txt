Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to forest fire dynamics and modeling, and it discusses various machine learning models and techniques used for predicting forest fires. However, it does not provide any information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
