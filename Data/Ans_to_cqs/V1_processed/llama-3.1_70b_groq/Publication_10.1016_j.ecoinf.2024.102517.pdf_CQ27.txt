Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setting, training of the bird sound noise reduction network, and comparative algorithms. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.

However, it does mention that the deep learning environment was constructed under the Windows operating system, using Python and TensorFlow â€“ GPU as well as CUDA. This suggests that the model was likely trained and tested on a GPU-enabled machine, but the specifics of deployment are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
