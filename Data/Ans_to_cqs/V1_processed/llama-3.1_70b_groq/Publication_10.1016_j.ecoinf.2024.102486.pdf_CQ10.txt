I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various tools and libraries used, such as the Deep Learning Toolbox, cuDNN, and Darknet, but does not provide a link to a specific code repository. It also mentions a Google Cloud VM instance and some research papers, but does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
