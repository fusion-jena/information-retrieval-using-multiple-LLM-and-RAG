Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only mentions that "some preprocessing steps like data augmentation and normalization are performed to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks" (section b). 

However, it does mention that the performance of the considered deep learning models is compared on the original dataset and the augmented dataset, and that the performance obtained by CNN models after augmentation is higher than the performance obtained under the original dataset (section 1). This suggests that some form of data augmentation is applied, but the specific techniques used are not specified.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
