Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on baleen whales, specifically analyzing their vocalizations and song patterns. It mentions the use of acoustic methods for detection, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

However, it does mention "baseline and monitoring surveys" which could potentially be a method used for collecting data. Additionally, it mentions "acoustic localisations" which suggests that acoustic sensors or recording devices may be used to collect data on whale vocalizations.

It's also worth noting that the context mentions "tracking sample" and "detections" which could imply that some form of data collection or monitoring is taking place, but the specific methods used are not clearly stated.

Overall, based on the provided context, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
