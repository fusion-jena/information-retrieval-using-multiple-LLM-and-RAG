Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that documentation for the entire machine learning pipeline can be found at (PyTorch, 2023) for Pytorch, (scikit-learn, 2023) for scikit-learn, and (skorch, 2022) for skorch, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Additionally, it mentions that links to public code examples of accessible platforms/frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are available, but it does not specify where the code repository for this specific pipeline is located.
