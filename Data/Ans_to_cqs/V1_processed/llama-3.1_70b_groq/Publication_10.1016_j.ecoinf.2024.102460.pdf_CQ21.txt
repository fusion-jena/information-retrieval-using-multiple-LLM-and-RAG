Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on land-use modeling, optimization, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
