Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance of various models, including deep learning models like SLSTM and SGRU, in predicting time-series data such as agricultural product sales and atmospheric CO concentration. It discusses the comparison of these models with traditional statistical models like ARIMA and SARIMA, and evaluates their performance using metrics like MAPE and RMSE. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
