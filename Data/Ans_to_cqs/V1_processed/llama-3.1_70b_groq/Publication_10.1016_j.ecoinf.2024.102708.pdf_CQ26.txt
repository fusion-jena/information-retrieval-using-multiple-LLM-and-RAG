The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset. 

Data augmentation involves applying random variations and manipulations to the data, such as flipping, cropping, contrast shift, translation, and rotation. This technique can help to increase the diversity of the training data and potentially reduce bias. However, it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the tiles containing Pacific oysters were split into 70% training and 30% validation, but it does not mention stratified splitting or any other techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique mentioned that could potentially address data bias is data augmentation. However, it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias, and other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are not mentioned.
