Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model's architecture, training, and evaluation, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

The context discusses the model's performance evaluation, data preprocessing, and training, but it does not mention model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related details. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
