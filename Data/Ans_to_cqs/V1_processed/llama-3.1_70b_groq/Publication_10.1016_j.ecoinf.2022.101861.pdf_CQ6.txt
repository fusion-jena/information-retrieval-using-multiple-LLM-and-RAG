Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on bird species identification using the Kaleidoscope Pro tool and mentions the use of machine learning and convolutional neural networks, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, as this information is not provided in the given context.
