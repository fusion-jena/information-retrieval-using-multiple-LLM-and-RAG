I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. It appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are queries that describe patterns in data, and how to select and refine these redescriptions based on certain criteria such as accuracy and complexity. However, it does not provide information on when training is considered complete or what criteria are used to determine this.
