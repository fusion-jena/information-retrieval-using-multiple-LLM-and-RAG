Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring, discussing various research papers and a crawling tool for collecting data from satellite images. However, it does not provide information on the specific model or its hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
