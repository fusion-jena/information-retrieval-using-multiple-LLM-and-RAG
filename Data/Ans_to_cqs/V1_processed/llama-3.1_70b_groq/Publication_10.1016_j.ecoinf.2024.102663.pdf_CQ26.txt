Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on image preprocessing techniques such as white balance, gamma correction, sharpening, dehazing, denoising, and CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), which are used to improve the quality of images before feeding them into a deep learning model (YOLOv8). 

There is no mention of techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
