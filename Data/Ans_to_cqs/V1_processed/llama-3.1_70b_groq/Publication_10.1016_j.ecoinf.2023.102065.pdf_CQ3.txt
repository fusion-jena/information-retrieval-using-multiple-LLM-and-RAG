Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for bird vocalization recognition, transfer learning, and fine-tuning with limited labeled data. It also mentions the use of mel-spectrograms as input data, but it does not provide information on how the data was annotated. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
