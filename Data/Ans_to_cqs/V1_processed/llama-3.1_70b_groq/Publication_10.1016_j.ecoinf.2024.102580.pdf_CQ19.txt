Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It mentions that Python 3.8.0 and Jupyter Notebook v6.4.5 were used for image processing, but it does not specify the deep learning framework used. It does mention the use of U-Net and DETR (DEtection TRansformer), which are architectures, but not frameworks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
