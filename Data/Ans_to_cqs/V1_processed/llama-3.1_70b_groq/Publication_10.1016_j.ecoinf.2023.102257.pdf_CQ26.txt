Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the use of machine learning (ML) models for image classification and object detection tasks, particularly in the context of wildlife monitoring.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of each class.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of instances of the minority class to balance the data.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the data.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the data is representative of the population of interest.

It's worth noting that these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, and I'm not aware of any specific techniques used to address data bias in the context of the experiment described. If you have any further questions or would like more information on these techniques, I'd be happy to try and help.
