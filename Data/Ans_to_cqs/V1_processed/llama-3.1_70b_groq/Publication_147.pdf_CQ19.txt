Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and XGBoost, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. The context does mention Keras in a reference, but it is not clear if Keras is used in the implementation of the CNN model.
