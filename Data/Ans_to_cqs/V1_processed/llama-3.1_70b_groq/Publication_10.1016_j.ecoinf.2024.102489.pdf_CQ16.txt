The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation was used to search for the optimal parameters of the RF model. This suggests that the training process may have been evaluated based on the model's performance on a validation set, but the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.
