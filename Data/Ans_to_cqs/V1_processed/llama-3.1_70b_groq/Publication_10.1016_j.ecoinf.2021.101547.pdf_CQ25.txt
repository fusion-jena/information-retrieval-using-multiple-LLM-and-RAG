The purpose of the deep learning model is to detect polar bears from background features throughout large volumes of aerial survey imagery collected over Baffin Bay in 2010. Specifically, the model is trained to distinguish between polar bears and background images, with the goal of accurately identifying polar bears in the images. This is a classification problem, where the model is trained to assign each image to one of two classes: "polar bear" or "background".
