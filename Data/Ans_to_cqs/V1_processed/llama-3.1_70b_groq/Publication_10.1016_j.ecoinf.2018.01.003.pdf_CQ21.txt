Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the mathematical model and equations used in a neural network, as well as various research papers and studies related to ecological informatics and machine learning.

However, I can provide some general information on common postprocessing steps involved in machine learning model training. Typically, after training a model, the following steps may be performed:

* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, etc. to evaluate the model's performance.
* Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It provides a summary of predictions against actual outcomes.
* Saliency maps: Saliency maps are used to visualize which input features are most important for a model's predictions. They can help identify the most relevant features contributing to the model's decisions.

However, without more specific information from the context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer on the postprocessing steps involved in this particular case.
