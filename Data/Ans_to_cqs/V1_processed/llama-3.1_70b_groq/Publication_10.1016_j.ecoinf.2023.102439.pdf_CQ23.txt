To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the study employed several measures. Firstly, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 60% of the data used for training and 40% for validation and testing. This data partitioning was done to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.

Additionally, the study used a diverse dataset, which included data from 2005 to 2018, encompassing 336 data points. This diverse dataset helped to capture various patterns and trends in the data, making the model more robust and generalizable.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data, while stratified splitting is a technique used to split the data into subsets based on specific characteristics. While these techniques can help improve the model's generalizability, there is no evidence to suggest that they were used in this study.

Overall, the study's use of a diverse dataset and data partitioning helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, the lack of cross-validation and stratified splitting may be a limitation of the study.
