The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the use of data augmentation and feature extraction enhancement as methods to improve the performance of the deep learning model.

The context suggests that data augmentation is not effective in this case, and instead, feature extraction enhancement is used to improve the model's performance. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "one-to-many augmentation" and "many-to-one normalization" methods to handle pose variability in face recognition, but it is not clear if these methods are used to address data bias.

The context also mentions that preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a preferred way to achieve better results, but it does not provide further details on the specific techniques used for preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
