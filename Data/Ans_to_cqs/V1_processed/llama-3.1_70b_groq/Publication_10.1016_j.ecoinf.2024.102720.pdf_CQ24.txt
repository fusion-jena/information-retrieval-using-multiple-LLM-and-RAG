Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on various research studies related to ecology, agriculture, and environmental science, with some mentions of machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as weight initialization, dropout, and batch normalization. To handle this randomness, researchers often employ techniques such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like batch normalization and dropout to reduce the effect of randomness
* Averaging the results of multiple runs with different random seeds to obtain a more robust estimate
* Using techniques like Monte Carlo dropout to estimate uncertainty in the model's predictions

However, without more specific information from the provided context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
