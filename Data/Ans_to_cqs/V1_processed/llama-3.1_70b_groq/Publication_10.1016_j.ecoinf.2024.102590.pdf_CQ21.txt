Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on the information provided in Section 2.3.5, it can be inferred that some form of accuracy assessment and land cover count is performed after the model training. 

The context mentions that the classification workflow is divided into five steps, and the last step is "accuracy, export, and land cover count" (Section 2.3.5). This suggests that some form of evaluation or assessment of the model's performance is performed after the training. However, the specific details of the postprocessing steps, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of confusion matrices, or generation of saliency maps, are not provided in the context.
