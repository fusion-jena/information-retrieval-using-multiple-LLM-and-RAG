Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the importance of fish biomass estimation, the challenges of estimating biomass in turbid environments, and the potential of deep learning techniques to address these challenges.

However, it does mention the use of various deep learning models and techniques, such as Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, YOLO, and Convolutional Neural Networks, to improve the accuracy of fish biomass estimates. Additionally, it mentions the use of preprocessing techniques, but it does not provide specific details on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
