According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Field surveys: The ideal situation is for the samples to be surveyed in the field. However, this method can be difficult and time-consuming, especially in remote environments.

2. Image interpretation: When field surveys are not feasible, researchers may employ image interpretation to gather training and validation sample points from imagery, such as GE HR images.

3. Satellite imagery: The context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 data, which includes visible bands (red, green, and blue), twelve MS bands, and other spectral indices.

4. Remote sensing: The use of Sentinel-1 bands and AW3D30 data suggests that remote sensing technologies are also employed for collecting raw data.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of public datasets or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. However, it does highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating the collected samples to ensure their accuracy and reliability.
