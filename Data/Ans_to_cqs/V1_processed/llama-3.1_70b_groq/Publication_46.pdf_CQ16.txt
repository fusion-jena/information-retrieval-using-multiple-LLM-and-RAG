Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on model validation, performance evaluation, and comparison of different models (BIOCLIM and CNN) using metrics like AUC, TSS, and kappa coefficient. It also provides some information about the architecture of the CNN model, including the use of pooling layers and the SoftMax function. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
