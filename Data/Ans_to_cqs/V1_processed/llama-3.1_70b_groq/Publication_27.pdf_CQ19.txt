Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and numbers, possibly due to encoding or formatting issues. As a result, I couldn't extract any relevant information about the frameworks used for building the deep learning model.

However, I can suggest that the frameworks mentioned in the query, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, are popular choices for building deep learning models. But without further information or clarification, I couldn't determine which specific frameworks are used in this case.
