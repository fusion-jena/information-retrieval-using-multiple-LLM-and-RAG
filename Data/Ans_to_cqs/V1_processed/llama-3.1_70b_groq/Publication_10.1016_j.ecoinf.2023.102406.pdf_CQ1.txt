Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species samples and thinning, and the conclusions drawn from such methods. It does not mention surveys, sensors, public datasets, or any other methods related to collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
