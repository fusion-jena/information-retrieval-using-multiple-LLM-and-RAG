Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning and configuration of the Random Forest (RF) model and the prediction algorithms used for gap filling. It also mentions feature analysis, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention that the performance evaluation and results are discussed in section 4.2, but the details of this section are not provided in the given context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
