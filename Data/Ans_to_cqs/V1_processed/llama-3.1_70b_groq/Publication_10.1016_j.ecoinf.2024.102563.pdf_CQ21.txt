Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on the classification results, methods, and accuracy metrics, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that some metrics calculation was performed, as the overall accuracy and kappa index values are reported in Table 3. But the exact steps involved in calculating these metrics or any other postprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
