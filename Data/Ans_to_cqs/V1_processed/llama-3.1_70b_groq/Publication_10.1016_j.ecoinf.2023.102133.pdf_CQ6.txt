Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the configuration and optimization of the model's hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons, learning rate, and activation functions. It also discusses the training process, including the use of backpropagation and optimization methods.

However, it does mention that "ML algorithms were also exploited to compensate for missing values in the dataset" in Section 3.3.5, which suggests that some form of data preprocessing or imputation may have been performed. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
