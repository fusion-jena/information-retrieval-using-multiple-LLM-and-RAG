Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text only mentions the use of the random forest (RF) model using the spatialRF package in R 4.2.2 software for analyzing the relative importance of environmental and anthropogenic variables on invasive plant species richness and abundance. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
