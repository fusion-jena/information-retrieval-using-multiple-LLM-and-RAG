To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was pre-trained with additional acoustic reference data from outside of the audio domain, which helped to increase the diversity of the training data. 

For fine-tuning the model, the ROIs (Regions of Interest) were split into training, validation, and test sets. Specifically, 50 ROIs per species were randomly sampled to form a held-out test set, 100 ROIs per species were randomly sampled to form a validation set, and the remaining ROIs were used for training. This stratified splitting approach helped to ensure that the model was evaluated on unseen data and that the performance metrics were not overestimated.

Additionally, to avoid temporal autocorrelation in the validation and test data, overlapping ROIs from different pattern-matching runs for a given species were placed in the training set. This helped to ensure that the model was not biased towards specific patterns or sequences in the data.

However, it is worth noting that the text does not mention the use of cross-validation, which is a common technique used to evaluate the generalizability of a model. Therefore, it is unclear whether cross-validation was used in this study.
