The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the experiments were "validated on the validation portion of the dataset." This suggests that the data was split into at least two parts: a training set and a validation set. 

It is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training is complete. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used to split the data in this specific case.
