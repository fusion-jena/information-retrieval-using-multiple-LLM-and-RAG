The provided context does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a classifier (or probability of occurrence estimator) and mentions that the testing data were 25% of samples, which is a randomly sampled split that is standard modeling practice. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or splitting of the data was used to evaluate the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the testing data were used to determine how well the classifier assigned classes using predictor variables, and that accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance. This suggests that the model was evaluated on a separate testing dataset, which is a common practice to ensure the generalizability of a model.

However, the context does not provide information on the diversity of the dataset or whether stratified splitting was used. Therefore, I can only partially answer the query.

To summarize, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model include:

* Using a separate testing dataset (25% of samples) to evaluate the model's performance
* Using accuracy metrics to evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset

However, I do not know if the dataset was diverse or if stratified splitting was used.
