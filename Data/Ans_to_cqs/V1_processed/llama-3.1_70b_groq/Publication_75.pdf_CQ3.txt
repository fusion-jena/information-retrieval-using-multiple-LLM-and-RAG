The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, network architecture, and results of the SeedNet model for seed image classification and retrieval. It does not provide information on the data annotation process. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
