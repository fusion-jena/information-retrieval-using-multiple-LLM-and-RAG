Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that during the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms, a K-fold cross-validation technique was implemented, and random under-sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set to address imbalances.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was initially extracted, and the feature set was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through stratified sampling. This suggests that some form of data preprocessing, such as data splitting and sampling, was performed.

However, it does not provide information on other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5 and 4 (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to enhance the language quality and fluency of the English content, but this is not directly related to the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model.
