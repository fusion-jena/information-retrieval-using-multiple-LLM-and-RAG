Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image and video data formats. Several papers mention the use of images and videos for tasks such as fish detection, fish size monitoring, and fish biomass estimation.

For example, the paper by Qin et al. (2022) discusses a fish detection method based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images. Similarly, the paper by Rani et al. (2024) presents a novel automated approach for fish biomass estimation in turbid environments through deep learning, object detection, and regression, which likely involves image or video data.

The paper by Coro and Walsh (2021) mentions the use of an underwater video device for fish size monitoring, which suggests that video data is also being used in the deep learning pipeline.

There is no mention of audio data being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not mentioned either, but it is possible that CSV files are used for storing and processing data related to fish biomass estimation or other tasks, although this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Overall, the primary data formats used in the deep learning pipeline appear to be images and videos.
