The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are listed in Table 1. The optimized values for the hyperparameters are:

* Learning rate (μ): 0.096
* Momentum (β): 0.845
* SD threshold (σ): 0.05
* Input size (s): (200, 250, 3)

These hyperparameters were optimized through a search process, with the following search intervals:
* Learning rate (μ): [0,1]
* Momentum (β): [0.05, 0.25]
* SD threshold (σ): [10, 5, 10]
* Input size (s): {(75, 125, 3), (100, 150, 3), (200, 250, 3)}

Note that the specific optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but the hyperparameters listed above are commonly used in deep learning models.
