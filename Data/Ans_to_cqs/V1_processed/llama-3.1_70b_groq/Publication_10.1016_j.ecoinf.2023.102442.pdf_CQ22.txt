The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the overall accuracy of the map increased from 84% to 91% after improving the urban and mining accuracy. Additionally, it mentions producer and user accuracy for specific classes such as water, forest, bare soil, mining, and urban. 

For example, the context mentions that the water class had a 99% producer accuracy and a 94% user accuracy, while the forest class had a 100% producer accuracy and a 93% user accuracy. It also mentions that the mining class had a 77% producer accuracy and an 86% user accuracy.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the performance of the deep learning model is likely evaluated using metrics such as overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. However, without more information, it is unclear whether other metrics such as precision and recall are also used.
