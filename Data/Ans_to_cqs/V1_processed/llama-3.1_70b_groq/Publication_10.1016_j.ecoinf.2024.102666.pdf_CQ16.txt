I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms for remote sensing of plateau lakes, specifically Erhai Lake in China. It discusses the study area, data collection, and evaluation of AC algorithms, but does not mention any criteria for determining when training is complete.
