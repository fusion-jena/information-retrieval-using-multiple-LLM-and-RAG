Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to permafrost modeling and geohazard assessment, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

However, in general, common criteria used to split data for deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets using random sampling.
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set.
* Time-based splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets based on time, such as using historical data for training and more recent data for testing.

Without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular context.
