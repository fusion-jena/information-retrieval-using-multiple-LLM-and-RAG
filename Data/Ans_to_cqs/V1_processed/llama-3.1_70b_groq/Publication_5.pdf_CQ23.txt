The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained and tested using data from Korea, and that a small subset of the data was used for iterative grid search parameter tuning. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance was evaluated using statistical accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Bias, and Correlation, and that the model was compared to a random forest model. 

It also mentions that a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) was performed to explain which feature had the greatest significance in the species richness retrievals, but this is more related to feature selection and interpretation rather than ensuring the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
