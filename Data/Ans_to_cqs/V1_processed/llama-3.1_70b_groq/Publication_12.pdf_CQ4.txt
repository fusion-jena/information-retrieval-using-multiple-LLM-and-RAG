The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention a method to increase the number of images for rare species, which involves rescaling the signals exponentially and shifting the window slightly either side of the call to change the background noise. This can be considered a form of data augmentation, but it is not a traditional technique like flipping or rotating. The context also mentions that the image size was reduced from 256*256 pixels to 64*64 pixels to save training time and reduce high memory graphics use, but this is not a data augmentation technique.
