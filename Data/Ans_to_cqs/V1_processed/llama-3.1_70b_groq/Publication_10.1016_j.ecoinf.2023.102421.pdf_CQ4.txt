I don't know. The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on the use of Bayesian optimizers and Tree-based Deep Optimization (TDO) to tune the hyperparameters of XGBoost and LightGBM models for estimating Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) from a tabulated dataset. It does not mention any image processing or data augmentation techniques.
