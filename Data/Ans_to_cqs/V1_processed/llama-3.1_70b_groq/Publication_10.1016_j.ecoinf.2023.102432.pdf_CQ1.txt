Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing images from various sources such as NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat. These images are likely used as the raw data for the machine learning approach.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of "training locations" which suggests that some form of field data collection or surveys may have been conducted to gather information about the presence of Brazilian peppertree at those locations. However, the exact methods used for collecting this field data are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the raw data collection methods may include remote sensing images and possibly field surveys or observations, but the exact methods are not explicitly stated.
