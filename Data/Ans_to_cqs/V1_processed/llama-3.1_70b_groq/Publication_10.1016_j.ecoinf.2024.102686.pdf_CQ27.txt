I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network for clustering and a database integration system for ecological informatics. The context includes equations, tables, and figures related to the SOM network and database, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model.
