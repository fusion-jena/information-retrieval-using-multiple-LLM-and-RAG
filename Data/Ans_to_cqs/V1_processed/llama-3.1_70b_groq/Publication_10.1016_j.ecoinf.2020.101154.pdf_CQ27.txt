Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the hyperparameter tuning process for the Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models and the Generalized Additive Models (GAM) used in the study. It provides details on the hyperparameter tuning, such as the learning rate, maximum tree depth, and number of iterations, but does not mention model deployment or serialization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
