The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN), is classification. The model is designed to identify bird sounds and classify them into different categories, taking into account the hierarchical relationships among bird populations. The model uses a hierarchical semantic embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels and employs attention mechanisms to extract and select common and distinguishing features. The ultimate goal of the model is to improve classification accuracy in bird acoustic recognition.
