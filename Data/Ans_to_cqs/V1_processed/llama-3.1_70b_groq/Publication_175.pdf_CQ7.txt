Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the training of deep learning models on different datasets, including a large dataset (AT0) and limited datasets (AT1, 250 and 500 images per class), but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and tune hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training is complete. The exact criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset, but common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation.

In this case, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
