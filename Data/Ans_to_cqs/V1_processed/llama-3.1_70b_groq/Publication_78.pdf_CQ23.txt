Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of multiple datasets (referred to as "all datasets" in Figure 10) and the comparison of accuracies of different classifiers for these datasets. This suggests that the model was evaluated on multiple datasets, which could help improve its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of techniques such as k-means clustering and the creation of a custom D-CNN (CoralNet) for feature extraction. These techniques could potentially help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques were used in this specific study.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a specific dataset (referred to as the "first dataset" in Table 2), which suggests that the model may have been evaluated on a specific dataset or set of datasets. However, without more information, it is difficult to say whether the model was evaluated on a diverse range of datasets or whether it was evaluated using techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.
