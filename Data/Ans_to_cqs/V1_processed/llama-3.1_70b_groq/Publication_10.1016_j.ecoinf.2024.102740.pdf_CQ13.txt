The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, machine learning, and grassland management, but it does not provide information on deep learning models.

However, the context does mention the use of Random Forest (RF) technique for classification, and it provides some information on the hyperparameters used for RF. According to the context, the hyperparameters used for RF include:

* Maximum tree depth: 10
* Minimum number of samples: 2
* Maximum number of trees: tested from 1 to 100
* Minimum node size: not specified, but mentioned as one of the hyperparameters

It's worth noting that the context does not provide information on the learning rate or optimizer, as these are typically used in deep learning models, not in RF or other traditional machine learning techniques.
