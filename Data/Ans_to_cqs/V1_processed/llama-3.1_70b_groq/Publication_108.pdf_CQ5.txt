The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or CIFAR-100. However, it is mentioned that the features learned by networks trained on common image datasets such as ImageNet might differ significantly from the features in the specific task at hand. 

Instead, the data used in this pipeline consists of orthophotos that were divided into small labeled tiles (or small image cubes) and fed into the CNN. Each orthophoto of size 10,000 × 10,000 pixels was divided into 1525 tiles of 256 × 256 pixels. The data were then split into three datasets: training (80%), validation (20%), and test (two full images of 10,000 × 10,000 pixels).
