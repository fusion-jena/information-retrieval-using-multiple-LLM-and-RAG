None of the provided context mentions specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and land cover classification using various machine learning algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). However, it does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
