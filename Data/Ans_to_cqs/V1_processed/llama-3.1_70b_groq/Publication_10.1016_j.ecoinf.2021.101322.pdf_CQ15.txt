Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only discusses the implementation and training of the CNN using Keras and TensorFlow, as well as the use of transfer learning with pre-trained weights from EfficientNet. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the model.
