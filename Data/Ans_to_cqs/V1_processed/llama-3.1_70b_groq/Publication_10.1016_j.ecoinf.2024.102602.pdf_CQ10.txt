I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the use of open-source classification and object detection models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and mentions specific models like Faster R-CNN ResNet101 and Inception-v2, but does not provide a link to a code repository.
