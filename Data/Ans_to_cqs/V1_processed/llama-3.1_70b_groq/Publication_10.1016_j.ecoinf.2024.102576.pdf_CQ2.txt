The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the target PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) has the same format as the trained PSI, which includes spatial resolution, spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order of each band. This suggests that the data format used is likely related to satellite imagery, possibly in the form of multi-band images or raster data. However, the exact file format (e.g., GeoTIFF, JPEG, CSV) is not specified.
