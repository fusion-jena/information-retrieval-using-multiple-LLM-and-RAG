The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is classification, specifically for bioacoustic classification. The text mentions the use of deep neural networks for large datasets on a wide variety of taxa, including marine mammals, and highlights their promise for automated machine learning classification. The context also mentions the use of neural networks for classifying echolocation clicks of dolphins, which further supports the classification purpose.
