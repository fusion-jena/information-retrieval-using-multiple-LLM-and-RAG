Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
