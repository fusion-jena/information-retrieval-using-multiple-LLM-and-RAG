Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of deep learning techniques, such as Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, and the modification of architectures like YOLO, but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning model.
