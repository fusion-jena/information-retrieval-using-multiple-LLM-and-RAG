Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It only mentions the architectures used, such as EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, InceptionResNetv2, ResNet50v2, and DenseNet201, but does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these architectures.
