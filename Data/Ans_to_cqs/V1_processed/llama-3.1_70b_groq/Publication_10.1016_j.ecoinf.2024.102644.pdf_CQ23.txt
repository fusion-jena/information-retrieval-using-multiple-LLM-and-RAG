Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of large-scale repositories of FAIR biodiversity data, such as GBIF and OBIS, and the importance of using these data cautiously due to potential sampling biases. It also mentions the use of data from a public authoritative repository (GBIF) improved with reliable records observed in the field, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
