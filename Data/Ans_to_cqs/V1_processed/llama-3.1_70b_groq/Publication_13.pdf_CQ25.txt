The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is classification. The model is trained to classify images into different taxon labels (family labels) and also to classify datasets. The model is used for within-dataset classification, where it is trained and tested on images from the same dataset, and for between-dataset classification, where it is trained on one dataset and tested on images from a different dataset. The model is also used to evaluate the consistency of prediction accuracy and to analyze the effects of the number of images and datasets on the accuracy of classification.
