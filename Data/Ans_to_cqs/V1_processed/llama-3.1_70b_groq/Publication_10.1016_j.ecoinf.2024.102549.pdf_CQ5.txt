Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of the AlexNet architecture for image scene classification tasks, particularly in environmental studies, and mentions the application of CNNs in processing high-dimensional imagery. However, it does not provide information on the datasets used in the pipeline.

The context does mention that the study employs the AlexNet architecture, which was originally proposed for the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). However, it does not explicitly state that the ImageNet dataset is used in this particular study.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
