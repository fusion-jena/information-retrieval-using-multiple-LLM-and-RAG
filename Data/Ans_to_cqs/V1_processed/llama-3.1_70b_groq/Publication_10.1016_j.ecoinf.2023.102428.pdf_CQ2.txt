Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a specific study related to Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain. It discusses the model's performance, accuracy assessment, and the use of ERDAS IMAGINE for stratified random sampling. However, it does not provide information on the data formats used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
