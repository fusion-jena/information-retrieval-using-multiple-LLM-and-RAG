The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of random noise terms in the Ricker recurrence equation (equation 7) and the Poisson distribution (equation 8 and 9). 

In the Ricker recurrence equation, a random noise term Îµt+1 is added to the population size xt+1. If the addition of this noise term results in a negative population size, a new random noise value is drawn from the normal distribution until a positive population size is obtained. This suggests that the model is designed to handle randomness in the population dynamics, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

In the context of the deep neural network (DNN) architecture, the text only mentions that the authors experimented with different architectures before settling on one with 17 hidden layers. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the DNN pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
