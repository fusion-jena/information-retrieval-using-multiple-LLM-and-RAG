Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of underwater optical images, the limitations of the original YOLOv8 network, and the introduction of new methods such as dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to improve feature extraction. It also mentions the DP-FishNet approach, which combines pyramid vision transformers and CNNs to extract global and local features from underwater images.

However, it does mention that the methods generally require a significant amount of underwater image data for training, but it does not specify how this data is collected. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
