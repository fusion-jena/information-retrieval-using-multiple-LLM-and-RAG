Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for understanding groundwater-climate interactions and investigating climatic hotspots implications within the sub-basins of the GAB region. It also mentions the use of linear interpolation technique for filling missing data, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
