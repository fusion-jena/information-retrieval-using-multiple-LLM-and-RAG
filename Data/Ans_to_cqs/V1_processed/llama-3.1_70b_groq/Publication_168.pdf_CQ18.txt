The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image were split into a training set and a test set with a ratio of 1:9. The training samples were used to learn the weights and biases of the network, and the test samples were used to evaluate the classification performance. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using the test set after training, but the specific strategy used to monitor performance during training is not mentioned.
