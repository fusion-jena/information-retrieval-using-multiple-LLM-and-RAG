The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization or scaling. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to make the CNN classification more robust and generalize better.

According to the context, the data augmentation techniques used include rotation, noise, and flip. These techniques were applied to augment the dataset by six times. Additionally, the context mentions that the input patch sizes were fixed at 256 Ã— 256 pixels, but it does not provide information on any other preprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing steps that can be confirmed are the use of data augmentation techniques (rotation, noise, and flip) and the fixing of input patch sizes. Other preprocessing steps, such as normalization or scaling, are not mentioned.
