The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the splitting of data for model training and validation in the context of other machine learning models.

According to the context, the data was split into 80% for training (test files) and 20% for validation (validation files) using the createDataPartition() function from the "caret" package. This splitting was done for the purpose of training and validating the models, including the Random Forest (RF) model, but not specifically for deep learning models.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention deep learning models at all, and the models mentioned (kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF) are not typically considered deep learning models. Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not mentioned in the provided context.
