Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that deep learning models have been widely employed in river health predictions, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. The context does mention the use of various machine learning models, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), but it does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
