I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text appears to be a passage from a research paper or academic article discussing the economic development and carbon emissions of Xi'an, China. It mentions data sources, funding, and author contributions, but does not mention deep learning or any related concepts. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
