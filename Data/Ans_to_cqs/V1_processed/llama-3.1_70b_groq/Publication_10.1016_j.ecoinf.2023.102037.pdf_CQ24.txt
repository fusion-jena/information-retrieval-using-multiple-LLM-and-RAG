Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be related to image classification, particularly in the domain of crop pests, and discusses various research papers and studies on the topic. However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, the context does mention "random data splitting" as a weak validation procedure that can lead to overestimation of model performance. This suggests that randomness is a consideration in the research, but the specific strategies for handling it are not discussed.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
