I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses a combination of least squares methods via genetic algorithms and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate model parameters, but it does not mention deep learning or any related hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer.
