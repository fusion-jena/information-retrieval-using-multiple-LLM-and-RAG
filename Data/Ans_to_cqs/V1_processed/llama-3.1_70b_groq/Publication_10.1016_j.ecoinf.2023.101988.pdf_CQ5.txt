Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to wildlife research, biodiversity monitoring, and ecological informatics, with a focus on unmanned aircraft systems, acoustic monitoring, and bird species identification. However, it does not provide information on the datasets used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
