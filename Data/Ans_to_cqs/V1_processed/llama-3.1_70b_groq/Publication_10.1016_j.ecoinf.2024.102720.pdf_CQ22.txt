I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study that uses Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the drivers of per capita CEFs, but it does not provide information on the performance metrics of a deep learning model. The only mention of a deep learning algorithm is in a reference to a report titled "strategic planning based on deep learning algorithm. IseB 21, 9", but it does not provide any details on the performance metrics used.
