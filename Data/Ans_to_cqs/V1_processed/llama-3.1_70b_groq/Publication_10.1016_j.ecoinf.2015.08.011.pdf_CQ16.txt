The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the early stopping technique, which is a regularization technique to avoid overfitting. According to the text, the training process is stopped when the network begins to overfit the data, i.e., the error on the validation set starts to increase. This is determined by monitoring the error on the validation set, which is 20% of the data set that was randomly split from the training set. The model weights are updated during training, and the training process is stopped when the error on the validation set starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting the training data.
