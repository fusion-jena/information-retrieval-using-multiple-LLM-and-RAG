The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of a `SaveModelCallback` with `every_epoch = TRUE`, which suggests that the model is saved after each epoch. This implies that the training process is set to run for a fixed number of epochs (in this case, 2 epochs for illustration purposes, and 20 epochs for the full results).

There is no mention of a validation loss plateau or any other criteria being used to determine when training is complete. The training process appears to be set to run for a fixed number of epochs, and the model is saved after each epoch.
