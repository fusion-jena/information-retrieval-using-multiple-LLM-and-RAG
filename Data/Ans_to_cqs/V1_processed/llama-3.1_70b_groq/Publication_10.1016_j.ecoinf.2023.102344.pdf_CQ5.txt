Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and performance of various deep learning models, including EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, as well as a custom model called BivalveNet. It mentions that the models are used for image-based classification tasks, specifically for identifying bivalve shell images, but it does not provide information on the datasets used for training or testing these models.
