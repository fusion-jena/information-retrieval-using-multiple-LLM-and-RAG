The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references and the context, it can be inferred that the data is likely collected using 3D lidar point clouds, mobile LiDAR data, and airborne LiDAR (ALS) point clouds.

The references mention the use of mobile LiDAR data (Guan et al., 2015) and airborne LiDAR (ALS) point clouds (Hu and Yuan, 2016) for deep learning-based classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of point cloud data, which is often collected using lidar sensors.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, the reference to the Semantic3D.net dataset (Hackel et al., 2017) suggests that public datasets may be used for benchmarking and evaluating the performance of deep learning models.

Overall, while the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated, it is likely that lidar sensors and point cloud data are used as the primary sources of data.
