The provided context does not explicitly mention all the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves video data. The context mentions "video clips" and "frames of the video," indicating that video is one of the data formats used. Additionally, the input of the networks is described as being in the form 3 × T × H × W, where T denotes the number of frames in a clip, and H and W are the height and width of the image. This further supports the use of video data. 

There is no mention of audio, CSV, or other data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be confirmed that video is one of the data formats used, but the use of other formats is unknown based on the given information.
