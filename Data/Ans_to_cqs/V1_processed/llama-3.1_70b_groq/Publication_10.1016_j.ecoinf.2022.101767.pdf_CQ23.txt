Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on valuing ecosystem services, YouTube video length, and TV nature programs, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or their generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
