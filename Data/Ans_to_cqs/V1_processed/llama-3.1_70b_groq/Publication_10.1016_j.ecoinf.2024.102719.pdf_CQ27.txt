Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of various machine learning models, including deep learning models, for predicting river health, and the evaluation of their generalizability using bias-variance decomposition. It also mentions the use of different algorithms and packages, such as CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost, but does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
