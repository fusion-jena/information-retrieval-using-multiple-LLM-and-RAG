Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of OpenCL in the context of implementing neural network systems on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) (Intel, 2016). Additionally, it mentions the use of various deep learning models such as MobileNetV3 (Zhu et al., 2019), YOLOv4 (Wang et al., 2021), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (Intel, 2016), but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
