The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that a comprehensive dataset was compiled to delve deeper into the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propagation. This dataset encompassed various influencing factors alongside an extensive drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020. Additionally, the dataset was divided into forty-two distinct datasets using a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year. This suggests that the model was trained and tested on multiple subsets of the data, which could help improve its generalizability. However, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.
