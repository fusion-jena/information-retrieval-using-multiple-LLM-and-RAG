The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the training process took around 10 hours on the CPU and the accuracy obtained reaches 95% on 140 epochs. This suggests that the model's performance was likely monitored through metrics such as accuracy, which was tracked over the course of the training process.
