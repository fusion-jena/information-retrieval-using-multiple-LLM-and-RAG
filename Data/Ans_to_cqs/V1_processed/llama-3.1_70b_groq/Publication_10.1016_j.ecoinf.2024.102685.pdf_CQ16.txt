I don't know. The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It discusses the use of random forest classification, the selection of hyperparameters, and the evaluation of model performance using metrics such as overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training.
