Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on water quality index (WQI) estimation using machine learning algorithms, data splitting ratios, and ranking of models based on various statistical measures.

However, it does mention that 20 and 10 random sample locations were selected for training and testing purposes, respectively. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data selection process, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
