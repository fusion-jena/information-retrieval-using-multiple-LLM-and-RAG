The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a semantic segmentation is conducted using previous works [51-53] to extract four classes - urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road - from the satellite images. This suggests that the data annotation technique used is likely semantic segmentation, where each pixel in the image is labeled with a class.

Additionally, the context mentions that the resulting images each contain both the real value of pixels of the extracted class and zero for the values of the other classes. This implies that the annotation technique used is a type of pixel-level annotation, where each pixel is labeled with a class.

There is no mention of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline.
