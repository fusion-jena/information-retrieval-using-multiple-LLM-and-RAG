Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the hyperparameters used in traditional machine learning models such as CART, RF, GTB, and SVM, as shown in Table 3. It mentions that deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are effective for LULC classification, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
