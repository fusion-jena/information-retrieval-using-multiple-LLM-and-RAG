The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model are Mean Bias Error (MBE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R2. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions. Specifically, MBE measures the average difference between predicted and observed values, RMSE measures the average magnitude of the errors, and R2 measures the correlation between predicted and observed values. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting canopy height models (CHM) from various data sources.
