The techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and class weights. However, these techniques were not used in the first stage of the research. Oversampling is also mentioned as a potential technique to be pursued in a second phase of the research. Stratified splitting is not explicitly mentioned, but a 60-20-20 train/validate/test regime was used to randomly split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Diverse data collection is not mentioned in the provided context.
