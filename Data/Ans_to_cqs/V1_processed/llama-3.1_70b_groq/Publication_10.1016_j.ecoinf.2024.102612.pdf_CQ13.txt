Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text focuses on the methodology, fuel model retrieval, and discussion of the results, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
