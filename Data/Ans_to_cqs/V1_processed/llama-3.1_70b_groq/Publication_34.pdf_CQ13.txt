The provided context mentions the following hyperparameters used in the deep learning model:

1. **Learning Rate**: The initial learning rate is set to 10^(-8). The choice of initial learning rate is critical for good optimization behavior, as a too big learning rate can lead to training loss divergence, while a too small learning rate can result in slow learning.

2. **Optimizer**: The optimization method used is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9. This is a common optimization algorithm used in deep learning.

3. **Batch Size**: The batch size is set to 50, with batch samples randomly chosen at each iteration.

4. **Stopping Rule**: The model is stopped when the average slope of the training mean loss has an absolute difference to 0 on the last 100 epochs inferior to 10^(-3).

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a uniform distribution U(0.03, 0.03) for initializing model parameters. However, it does not provide information on other hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, or the activation functions used.
