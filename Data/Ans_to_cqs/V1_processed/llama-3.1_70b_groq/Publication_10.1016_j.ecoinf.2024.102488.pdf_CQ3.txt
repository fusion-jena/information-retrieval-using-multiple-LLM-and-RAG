Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, wetland mapping, and machine learning algorithms, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

However, I can mention that some of the papers mentioned in the context, such as Wu et al. (2021a) and Wu et al. (2021b), use remote sensing data, such as SAR imagery and MODIS data, which may require annotation techniques like image classification or object detection. But the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
