Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the potential use of deep learning techniques for preprocessing and training models, as well as the comparison of different machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge). However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
