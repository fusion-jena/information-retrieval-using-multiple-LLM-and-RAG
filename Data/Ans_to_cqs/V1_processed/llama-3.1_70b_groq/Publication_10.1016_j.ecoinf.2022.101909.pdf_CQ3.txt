Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and implementation of the ResNet50 model, transfer learning, and fine-tuning techniques. It also mentions the use of color spectrograms as inputs to the model, but it does not provide information on how the data was annotated.

However, it can be inferred that the data annotation technique used might be related to classification or tagging of bird species, as the model is designed for bird species identification. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
