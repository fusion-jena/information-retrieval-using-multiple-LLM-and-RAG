Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of ResNet-50 for feature extraction, the structure of the model, and the training times and validation accuracies of different variants of ResNet. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used to train the model.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
