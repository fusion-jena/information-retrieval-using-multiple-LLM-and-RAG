To ensure the generalizability of the model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a holdback trial partitioning test was performed on the training sets for 44 captive Amur tigers. This involved iterating the analysis 10 times for each combination of test/training size, with randomly selected trails. This process helped to examine how the predicted outcome compared with the known test set size.

Additionally, the test/training set size was varied to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results showed that even when the test to training set ratio was 32:12, the predicted value was close to the expected value, demonstrating the model's robustness.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether a diverse dataset was used or if stratified splitting was employed. The text only mentions that the algorithm was trained on a dataset of captive Amur tigers and that the test/training sets were partitioned randomly.

It is also not clear if cross-validation was used in the classical sense, but the holdback trial partitioning test can be seen as a form of cross-validation, where the model is trained and tested on different subsets of the data.
