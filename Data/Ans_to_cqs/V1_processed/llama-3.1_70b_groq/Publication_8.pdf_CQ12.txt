The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it is mentioned that the most common type of deep learning network architecture being used for extracting image features is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, the text mentions the use of Faster R-CNN, which is a variant of CNN, for training the model.
