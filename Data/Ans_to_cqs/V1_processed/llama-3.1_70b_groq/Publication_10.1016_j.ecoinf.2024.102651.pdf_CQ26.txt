Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the performance of different classification networks, such as ResNet, ViT, and CA-Hybrid, on a specific dataset, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
