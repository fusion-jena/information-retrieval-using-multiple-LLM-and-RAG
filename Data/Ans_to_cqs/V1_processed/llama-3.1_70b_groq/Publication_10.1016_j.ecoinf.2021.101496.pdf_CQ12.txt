The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Specifically, it is a simple ANN with two input nodes and one output node, with no hidden layers. This is mentioned in the text as: "The ANN was constructed empirically, with the first layer containing two input nodes (one per each of the two parameters that were found to be the most suitable by LM and GLM) and the last layer containing only one node (predicted SPAD value)." There is no mention of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
