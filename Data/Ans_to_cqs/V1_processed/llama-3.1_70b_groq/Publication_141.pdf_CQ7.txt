Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide some information about the data split. 

The context mentions "Train" and "Valid" (short for validation) datasets, along with their respective accuracy and misclassified images. For example, it mentions "Train. 18 of 1472" and "Valid. 7 of 374" for a particular model. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or ratio used for the split is not specified.

It is common practice in deep learning to split the data into training, validation, and test sets, typically in a ratio of 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. However, this information is not provided in the given context.
