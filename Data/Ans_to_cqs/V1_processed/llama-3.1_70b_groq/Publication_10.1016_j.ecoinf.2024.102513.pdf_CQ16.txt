Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context only mentions the training configuration, including the division of the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 70:20:10, respectively. It also mentions the use of the sklearn library for accuracy calculation, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
