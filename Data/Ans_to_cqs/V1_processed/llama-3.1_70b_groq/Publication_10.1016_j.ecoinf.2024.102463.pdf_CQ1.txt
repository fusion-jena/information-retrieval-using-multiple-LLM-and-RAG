Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the use of a deep learning tool, specifically the Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks (HRHN), for reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers. It mentions that the data is obtained from monitoring stations on the Rh√¥ne River and the Loire River, but it does not provide information on how the data is collected at these stations. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this pipeline.
