Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process using the TPEBO algorithm and the development of the TPEBO-LSTM neural network. It discusses the importance of hyperparameters in shaping the architecture of deep learning models, the exploratory phase of random searches, and the narrowing down of the search space to approximate the global optimum.

The context also mentions the training process of the TPEBO-LSTM model, comprising 10,000 iterations, and the logging of chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
