The provided context does not specifically discuss regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention some techniques that can be related to regularization.

One of the papers mentioned, "Ranstam, J., Cook, J.A., 2018. LASSO regression. Br. J. Surg. 105, 1348.", discusses LASSO regression, which is a type of regularization technique that uses L1 regularization to reduce overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions "Penalized regression" as one of the algorithms used in the study, which can include regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization.

However, the context does not specifically mention dropout as a regularization method.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that LASSO regression and Penalized regression are mentioned as techniques that can be used to prevent overfitting, but dropout is not mentioned.
