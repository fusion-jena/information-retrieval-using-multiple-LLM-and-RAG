Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to species distribution modeling, and the use of bioclimatic variables to identify groups containing species and near background points.

However, it does mention the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a related study (Deneu et al., 2022) to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. But it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps used in that study.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
