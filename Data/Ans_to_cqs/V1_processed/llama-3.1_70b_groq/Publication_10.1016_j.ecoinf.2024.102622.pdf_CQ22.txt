The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models in the provided context are:

1. R2 (Coefficient of Determination): measures the goodness of fit of the model.
2. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): measures the average difference between predicted and actual values.
3. REP (Relative Error Percentage): measures the relative difference between predicted and actual values, expressed as a percentage.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost), in estimating rice LCC (Leaf Chlorophyll Content) and canopy coverage.
