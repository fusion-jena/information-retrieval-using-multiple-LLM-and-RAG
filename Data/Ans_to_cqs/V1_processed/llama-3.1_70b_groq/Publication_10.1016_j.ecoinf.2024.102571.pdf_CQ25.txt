The purpose of the deep learning model is prediction, specifically predicting greenhouse gas emissions (GHGdwts) based on input factors such as population size and GDP. The model is a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture, and it is trained on 70% of the data, with 15% used for validation and 15% for testing. The model's accuracy is evaluated using the R2 value, which is not explicitly stated in the provided context snippet, but it is mentioned that the model is accurate.
