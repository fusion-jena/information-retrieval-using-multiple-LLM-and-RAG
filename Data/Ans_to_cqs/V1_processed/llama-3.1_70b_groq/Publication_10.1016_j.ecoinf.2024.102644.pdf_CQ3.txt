I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a discussion on the use of big-data mining approaches and Artificial Intelligence models to predict biodiversity changes and study the implications of climate change on fragile ecosystems, specifically in the context of the Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. The text mentions the use of species observation data from a public repository (GBIF) and reliable records observed in the field, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
