Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text only discusses the importance of high-quality training samples and the layout of sampling points for constructing accurate and reliable models for biomass estimation. It also mentions that a method with low data dependency was employed due to the insufficiency of high-quality training samples, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study.
