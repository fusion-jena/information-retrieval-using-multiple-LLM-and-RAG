I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a collection of references and a text discussing environmental topics such as soil erosion, lake drying, and drought zoning. The text mentions the use of remote sensing datasets, Landsat satellite images, and precipitation datasets, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
