I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing various types of data, such as Sentinel-2 data, GEDI data, and field data, as well as their spatial and temporal resolutions. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
