I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or a pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental studies, with references to papers on topics such as combating desertification, drought effects on grassland, and time-lag effects of climate change on vegetation. There is also a section with mathematical equations that seem to be related to calculating changes in land use/cover types, but there is no mention of deep learning models or pipelines.
