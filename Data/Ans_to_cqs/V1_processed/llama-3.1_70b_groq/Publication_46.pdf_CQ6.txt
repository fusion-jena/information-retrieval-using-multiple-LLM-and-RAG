Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on explaining the components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and its functionality, including convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. It also provides information about the authors, funding, and institutional review board statements, but does not discuss preprocessing steps.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial before training a deep learning model. These steps help to prepare the data, reduce noise, and improve the model's performance. But, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular study.

Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the given context.
