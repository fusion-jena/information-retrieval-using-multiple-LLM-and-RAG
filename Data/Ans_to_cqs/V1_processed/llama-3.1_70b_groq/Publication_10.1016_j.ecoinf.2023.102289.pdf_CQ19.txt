The deep learning model is built using MXNet, an open-source AI platform, in combination with GluonCV, a computer vision library that provides pre-trained models and computational functions. Specifically, the model employs the deeplabv3 + resnet269 model, which is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google, and a 269-layer Resnet neural network.
