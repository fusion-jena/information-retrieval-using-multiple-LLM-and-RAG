The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Intersection over Union (IoU) and Accuracy. 

Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric that computes the intersection of the reference dataset and the predicted classification, and divides it by the union of the two. This is represented by the equation: IoU = TP / (TP + FP + FN), where TP, FP, and FN are true positive, false positive, and false negative, respectively.

Accuracy is another metric used to evaluate the model's performance. It is calculated as the sum of true positives and true negatives, divided by the sum of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. This is represented by the equation: Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FN + FP + TN).

The model also uses a custom implementation of the IoU metric, which operates according to a specific algorithm to compute the mean intersection over union for thresholds between 0.5 and 1. This is necessary because the feed-forward neural network outputs a probability of a class rather than a class label, and a threshold needs to be set to obtain a confusion matrix and compute the evaluation metrics.
