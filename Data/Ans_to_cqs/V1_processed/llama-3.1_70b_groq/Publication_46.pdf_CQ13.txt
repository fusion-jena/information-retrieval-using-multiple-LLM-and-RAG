The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. However, it does mention that the hyperparameters involved in convolution operations are the size and number of kernels. The size could be anything from 3 × 3 to 5 × 5 to 7 × 7, and the kernel could be chosen randomly. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the neurons receive the input values and multiply them with the specific weight obtained through optimization, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used. It also mentions that the weighted sum is transformed through the nonlinear activation function, but it does not specify the type of activation function used.

Therefore, the only hyperparameters mentioned in the context are the size and number of kernels, but other hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer are not specified.
