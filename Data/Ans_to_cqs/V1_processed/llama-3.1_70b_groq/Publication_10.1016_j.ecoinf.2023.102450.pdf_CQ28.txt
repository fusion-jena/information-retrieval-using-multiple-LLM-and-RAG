The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. It only mentions the hardware and software used for training the model, which includes a personal computer with a 1060Ti GPU, Ubuntu 20.04 operating system, CUDA v10.1, and Python version 3.7. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
