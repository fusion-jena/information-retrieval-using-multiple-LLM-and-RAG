I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) analyzed the effect of sample size on deep neural networks, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a random forest model, which is a machine learning model based on decision trees, but it is not a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
