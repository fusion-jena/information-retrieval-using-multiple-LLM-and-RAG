The provided context does not specifically mention the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention "steepest descent" which is related to the optimization technique used in the gradient boosting algorithm.

According to the context, the steepest descent direction is the negative gradient of the loss function evaluated at the current model Fm−1. The step length γm is chosen using line search. This suggests that a form of gradient descent is used in the gradient boosting algorithm, but it is not explicitly stated as SGD or Adam.

Additionally, the context mentions "early stopping" which is a technique used to avoid overfitting by stopping the model training when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This is another optimization technique used in the gradient boosting algorithm.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the deep learning pipeline or specific optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam, it does mention related optimization techniques such as steepest descent and early stopping.
