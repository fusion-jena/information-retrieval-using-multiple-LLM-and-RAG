Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the hyperparameters used for training, such as epochs and batch size, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the trained models, including precision, mean average precision (mAP@0.5), recall, and mean percent error of misdetection. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during the training process.
