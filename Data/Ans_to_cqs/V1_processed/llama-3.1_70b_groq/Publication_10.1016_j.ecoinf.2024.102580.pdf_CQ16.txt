The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model accuracy was assessed after each full training set iteration (epoch), and that the training loss curve and validation loss curve are shown in Figure 3. This suggests that the training process may have been monitored and stopped when the validation loss stopped improving or reached a certain threshold, but the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training are not specified.
