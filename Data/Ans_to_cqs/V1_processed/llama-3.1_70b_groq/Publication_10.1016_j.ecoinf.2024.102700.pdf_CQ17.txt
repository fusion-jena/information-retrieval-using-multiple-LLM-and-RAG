Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that Maxent, a machine learning technique, uses a "regularisation multiplier" to find a proper trade-off between flexibility and overfitting, but it does not provide further details on the specific regularization methods used.

Additionally, the text mentions that deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, are used in some studies, but it does not provide information on the regularization methods used in these studies.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. However, I can suggest that common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L2 regularization, and L1 regularization, among others. But this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
