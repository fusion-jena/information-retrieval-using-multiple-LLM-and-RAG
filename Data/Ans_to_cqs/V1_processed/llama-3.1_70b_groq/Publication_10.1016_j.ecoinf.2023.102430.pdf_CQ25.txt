The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is used for the automated identification of Chagas disease vectors, which are triatomine bugs. The model is trained to classify images of these bugs into different species, with the goal of strengthening entomological surveillance systems. The model is tested on a database of images of triatomine bugs, and its performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and specificity.
