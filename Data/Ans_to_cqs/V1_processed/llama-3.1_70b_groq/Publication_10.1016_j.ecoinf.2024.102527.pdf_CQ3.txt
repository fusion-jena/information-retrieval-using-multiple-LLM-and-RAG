Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context only mentions that the ImageNet dataset is manually annotated, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
