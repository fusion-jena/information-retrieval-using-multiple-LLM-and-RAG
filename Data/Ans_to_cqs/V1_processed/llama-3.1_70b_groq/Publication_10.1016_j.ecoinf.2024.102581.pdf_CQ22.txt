The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This is evident from Table 7, which provides the classification results of the HPB3C-3PGA-based CNN approach on the Mendeley and CVIP100 datasets. The table includes columns for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, indicating that these metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance.
