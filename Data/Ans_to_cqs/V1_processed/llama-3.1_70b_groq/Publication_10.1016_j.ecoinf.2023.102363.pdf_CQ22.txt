The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1 Score. Additionally, the Mean AUC (Roc curve) is also used to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics are calculated based on the number of true and false positive detections, as well as the number of true and false negative detections. The formulas for calculating Precision, Recall, and Accuracy are provided in the context as follows:

Precision (P) = NTP / (NTP + NFP)
Recall (R) = NTP / (NTP + NFN)
Accuracy (A) = (NTP + NTN) / (NTP + NFP + NTN + NFN)

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.
