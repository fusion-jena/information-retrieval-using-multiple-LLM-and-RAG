The text does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears to be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The text mentions the use of convolutional kernels, spectral normalization, and LeakyReLU activation, which are all common components of CNN architectures. Additionally, the text discusses the use of dynamic convolutional kernels, which is a technique often used in CNNs to improve feature extraction. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers, which are typically used for sequential data or natural language processing tasks. Therefore, based on the context, it is likely that the pipeline uses a CNN model.
