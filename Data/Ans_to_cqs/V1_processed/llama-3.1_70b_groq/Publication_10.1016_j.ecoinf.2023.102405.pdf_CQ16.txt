Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be a part of a research paper or a technical document that describes the implementation of an AODEGRU model, including the training process. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Typically, training is considered complete when a certain condition is met, such as:

* A specified number of epochs have been completed
* The validation loss has plateaued or reached a minimum value
* The validation accuracy has reached a maximum value
* A certain amount of time has elapsed

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which criteria are used to determine when training is complete in this specific case.
