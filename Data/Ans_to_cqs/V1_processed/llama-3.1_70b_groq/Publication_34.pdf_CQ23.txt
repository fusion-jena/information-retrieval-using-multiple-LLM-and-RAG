To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors took several measures. Firstly, they selected a high number of randomly chosen species to work with, which helped to reduce the bias that could arise from choosing a particular category of species. From the initial 7626 species, they selected species with more than 300 observations, resulting in a subset of 1000 species (E1000). They then randomly selected 200 species from E1000 to constitute E200, and finally, 50 species from E200 to constitute E50, which was the main dataset used to compare their model to the baselines.

This approach of selecting a random subset of species at each step helped to ensure that the results were not biased towards a particular group of species. Additionally, the use of a large number of species (1000) in the output of the CNN1000 model helped to test the generalizability of the model at a larger taxonomic scale.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to further ensure the generalizability of the model.
