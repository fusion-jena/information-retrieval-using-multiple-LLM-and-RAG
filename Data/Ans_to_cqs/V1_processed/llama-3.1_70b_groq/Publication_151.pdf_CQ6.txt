Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model architecture, and placement of query sequences onto a reference tree using the trained model.

However, it does mention the use of a weighted sum to combine distances computed with and without gap reconstruction, which suggests that the model is designed to handle missing data (gaps) in the query sequences. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a batch size of 32 and a running average of the recent magnitude to speed up training, but these are more related to the training process than preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
