Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on analyzing a multifrequency acoustics dataset using Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and dimension reduction techniques, but it does not provide information on deep learning model training or preprocessing steps.

However, it does mention dimension reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and data aggregation methods, which could be considered as preprocessing steps in certain contexts. But without more specific information, it is unclear whether these steps are directly related to deep learning model training.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
