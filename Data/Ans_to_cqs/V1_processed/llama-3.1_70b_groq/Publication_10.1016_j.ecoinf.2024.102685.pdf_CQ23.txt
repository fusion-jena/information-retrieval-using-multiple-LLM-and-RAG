The provided context does not specifically mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of cross-validation in the context of random forest classification. According to the text, "repeated cross validations performed with 10 folds and 10 repetitions for the seagrass meadow models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow models" were used to automatically select the number of variables used for each node (mtry).

This suggests that cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the model and to select the optimal hyperparameters. However, it is not clear if this was done for a deep learning model specifically, as the text only mentions random forest classification.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I can only confirm that cross-validation was used in the context of random forest classification, but I do not know if it was used for a deep learning model or if other measures were taken to ensure generalizability.
