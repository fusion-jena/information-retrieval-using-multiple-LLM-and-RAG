Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be a collection of encoded text and numerical values, but it does not provide a clear explanation of the training completion criteria.

However, in general, the criteria used to determine when training is complete can vary depending on the specific problem, model, and training algorithm. Some common criteria used to determine when training is complete include:

* Validation loss plateau: When the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau, it may indicate that the model has converged and training can be stopped.
* Validation accuracy threshold: When the validation accuracy reaches a certain threshold, training can be stopped.
* Maximum number of epochs: Training can be stopped after a fixed number of epochs, regardless of the validation loss or accuracy.
* Early stopping: Training can be stopped when the validation loss starts to increase or the validation accuracy starts to decrease.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer. If you have any additional context or information, I may be able to provide a more helpful response.
