Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for hyperspectral image classification, the structure of the network, and the results of the experiment. It also references several papers on deep learning-based methods for hyperspectral image classification, but does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
