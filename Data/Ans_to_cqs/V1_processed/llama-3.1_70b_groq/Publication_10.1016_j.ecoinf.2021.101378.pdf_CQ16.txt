The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that the dataset was randomly separated into two parts with a ratio of 7:3 for model training and testing, and that the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve values were used to evaluate the performance of each model. However, it does not provide information on how the training process was stopped or what criteria were used to determine convergence.
