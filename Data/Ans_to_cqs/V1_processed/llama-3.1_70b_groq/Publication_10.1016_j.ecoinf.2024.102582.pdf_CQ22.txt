The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention some metrics related to the accuracy of landscape classification, such as:

* User's accuracy (%)
* Total accuracy (%)
* Kappa coefficient

These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of landscape classification, but it is not clear if they are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model specifically. Additionally, the context mentions that the application of images with 30-m spatial resolution for remote sensing monitoring of mangrove forests led to limited classification accuracy, but it does not provide further details on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.
