The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are:

1. R2 (coefficient of determination): This metric measures the goodness of fit of the model, with higher values indicating better performance.
2. MSE (mean squared error): This metric measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance.
3. MAE (mean absolute error): This metric measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance.

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, including WTD-GWO-SVR, LSTM, and BPNN, in predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. The results are presented in tables, such as Table 7 and Table 8, which show the median values of measured versus computed DO concentration and the average values of the training and validation phases, respectively.
