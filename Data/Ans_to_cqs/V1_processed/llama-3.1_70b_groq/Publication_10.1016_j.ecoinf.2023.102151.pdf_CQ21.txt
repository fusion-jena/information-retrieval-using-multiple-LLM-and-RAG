Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on various topics related to soil science, irrigation, and visualization, but it does not provide information on machine learning model training or postprocessing steps.

However, I can suggest that the context does mention visualization tools and techniques, such as the BeingAliveLanguage and Pi-VAT, which are used for visualizing and analyzing data. But it does not provide specific information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
