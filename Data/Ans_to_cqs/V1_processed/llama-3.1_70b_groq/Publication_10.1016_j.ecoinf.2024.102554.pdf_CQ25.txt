Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific purpose of a deep learning model. The text discusses the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies with satellite data interpretation for aquatic environmental monitoring, but it does not delve into the specifics of a deep learning model or its purpose. It mentions the development of sophisticated algorithms for atmospheric correction and the estimation of Chl-a concentrations, but it does not provide information on the purpose of a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
