The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the early stopping procedure, which monitors the validation loss. Specifically, the patience parameter, which controls the number of epochs without improvements in the validation loss, is set to 10. This means that if the validation loss does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs, the training is stopped to avoid over-fitting.
