Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix, etc. The context only discusses the training process, including the preparation of training images, the training process itself, and the calculation of loss scores. It does not provide information on what happens after the model is trained.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
