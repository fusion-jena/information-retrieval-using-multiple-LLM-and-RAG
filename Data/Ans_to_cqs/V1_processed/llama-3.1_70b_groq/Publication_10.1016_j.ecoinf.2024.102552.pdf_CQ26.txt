Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, remote sensing, and historical ecology, with discussions on classification schemes, machine learning tools, and uncertainty analysis. However, it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

That being said, the context does mention the importance of high-quality inputs (both imagery and training data) for machine learning methods, and the limitations of these methods when dealing with historical imagery with variable characteristics. It also touches on the idea of using diverse data sources, such as online spectral libraries, to refine classifications. However, these points are not directly related to the specific techniques mentioned in the query (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection).

Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not provide a clear answer to the query.
