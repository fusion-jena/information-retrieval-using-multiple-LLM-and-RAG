Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of object detection models, feature maps, and the limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in detecting small objects.

However, it is common in deep learning pipelines to apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the model's robustness. These techniques can include:

* Flipping (horizontal and/or vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (resizing images)
* Color jittering (changing brightness, contrast, saturation)
* Cropping (randomly cropping images)

But without specific information from the context, I cannot confirm which data augmentation techniques are applied in this particular pipeline.
