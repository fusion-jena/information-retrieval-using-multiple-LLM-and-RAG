Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses the comparison of different covariate selection procedures (embedded, filter, and random) and their impact on model accuracy and computation time. It also mentions the use of various metrics such as Somers' D, True Skill Statistic, and continuous Boyce index to evaluate model performance, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
