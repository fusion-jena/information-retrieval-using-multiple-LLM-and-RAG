I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. It discusses the process of building models for species distribution modeling, including subsetting background points, training individual models, and ensemble models. The context mentions specific modeling approaches such as Random Forest (RF), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and MaxEnt, but does not mention deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
