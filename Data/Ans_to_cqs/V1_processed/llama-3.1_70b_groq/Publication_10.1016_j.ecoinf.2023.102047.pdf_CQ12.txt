The pipeline uses various types of deep learning models, including:

1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Specifically, the Cspnet backbone is mentioned, which is a new backbone that can enhance the learning capability of CNN.
2. Encoder-Decoder model: Wang et al. (2020a) developed an encoder-decoder-based deep-learning model to estimate seagrass coverage.
3. Deep Capsule Network (DCN): Perez et al. (2020) applied a deep capsule network (DCN) to map seagrass distribution.
4. Faster R-CNN: Noman et al. (2021b) proposed using Faster R-CNN with the NASNet model for object detection.
5. EfficientDet: The EfficientDet architecture is mentioned as a two-stage detector that is gaining popularity due to its excellent detection performance and relatively lower FLOPS.

These models are used for various tasks such as seagrass coverage estimation, seagrass distribution mapping, and object detection.
