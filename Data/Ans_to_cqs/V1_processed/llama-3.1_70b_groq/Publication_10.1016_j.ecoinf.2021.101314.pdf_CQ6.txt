Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are used to identify local patterns in data. It mentions parameters such as thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions, length and complexity of queries, and accuracy gains. However, it does not mention any preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are typically involved in training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
