I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning for wildfire event prediction in Australia, discussing various studies and methodologies, but it does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
