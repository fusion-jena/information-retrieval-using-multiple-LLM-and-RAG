I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about model training, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. It appears to be a research paper about ecological informatics, focusing on climate, terrain, and human activity data, as well as vegetation index (kNDVI) trends and classification. There is no information about machine learning or deep learning models, which are typically associated with postprocessing steps like saliency maps and metrics calculation.
