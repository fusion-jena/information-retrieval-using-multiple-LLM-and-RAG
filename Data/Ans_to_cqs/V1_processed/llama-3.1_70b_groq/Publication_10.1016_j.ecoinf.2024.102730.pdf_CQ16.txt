The criteria used to determine when training is complete are the maximum number of iterations and the maximum number of iterations with no improvement. According to Table 2, the maximum number of iterations is set to 100, and the maximum number of iterations with no improvement is also set to 100. This means that the training process will stop when either the maximum number of iterations is reached or when there is no improvement in the model's performance for 100 consecutive iterations.
