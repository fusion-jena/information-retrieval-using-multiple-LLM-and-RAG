According to Table 5, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include:

1. Accuracy (Acc): measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances in the dataset.
2. Loss: measures the error between predicted and actual values in a model.
3. Area Under Curve (AUC): represents the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
4. Cohenâ€™s Kappa (CK): measures the agreement between two raters classifying items into mutually exclusive categories.
5. Precision: measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model.
6. Recall (Sensitivity): measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances in the dataset.
7. F1 Score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Additionally, the following metrics are also used to evaluate the performance of the model:

1. Model Size: refers to the size of the trained model, usually measured in terms of parameters or memory footprint.
2. Inference Time: measures the time taken by the model to process a single input and generate an output prediction.
3. FLOP Count: represents the number of arithmetic operations performed by the model during inference or training.
4. Analysis Time: measures the time taken by the model to process a given dataset or perform a specific task.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, including its accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness.
