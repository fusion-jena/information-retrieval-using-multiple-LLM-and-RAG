The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the model was trained using transfer learning, with the pretrained general-purpose YOLO object detector as a starting point, and that the initial weights were created by training on the COCO dataset. Additionally, it mentions that the model was fine-tuned by freezing all layers and then adjusting the weighting of the no-object component of the multipart loss function. But it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
