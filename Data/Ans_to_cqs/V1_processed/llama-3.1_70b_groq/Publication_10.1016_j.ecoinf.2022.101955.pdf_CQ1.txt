The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data, which implies that data is collected through sensors, such as satellite or aerial imagery. Additionally, the context mentions the use of SPOT-5 HRG imagery, which is a type of satellite imagery.

It can be inferred that remote sensing data is a primary source of data collection in this context. However, it does not provide information on other methods such as surveys or public datasets.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of machine learning algorithms for land use classification, which suggests that the data collection process may involve collecting and labeling data from various sources, including remote sensing data, to train and validate the models. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly mentioned.
