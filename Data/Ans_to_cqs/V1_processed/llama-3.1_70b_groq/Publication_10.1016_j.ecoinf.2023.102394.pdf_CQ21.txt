Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context only provides information about the model specification, data preprocessing, and model implementation, but it does not provide details about the postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention that the model was used for forecasting and hindcasting SOCS conditions over time, but it does not provide information about how the performance of the model was evaluated or what metrics were used to calculate its accuracy.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as this information is not provided in the context.
