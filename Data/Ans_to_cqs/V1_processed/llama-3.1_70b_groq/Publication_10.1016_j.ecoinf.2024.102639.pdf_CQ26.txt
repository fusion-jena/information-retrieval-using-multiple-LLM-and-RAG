Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), to behavioral science, and discusses the use of techniques such as grid search and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, as well as dimensionality reduction. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

That being said, the context does mention the use of cross-validation, which can help to mitigate overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model. However, it does not specifically address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist further.
