The text does not mention the use of any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions the use of 17 datasets obtained after applying a data pre-processing algorithm to data from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF) and field observations. These datasets are used as proxy environmental conditions for annual environmental snapshots in specific years and under certain climate scenarios.
