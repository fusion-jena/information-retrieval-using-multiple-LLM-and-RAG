The provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters of a model, nor does it discuss the use of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization techniques. The context appears to be focused on a study that uses Twitter data to monitor observations of marine life, and it discusses the methodology used to collect and process the data, but it does not provide information on model optimization.
