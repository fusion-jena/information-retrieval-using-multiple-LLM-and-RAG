Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for prediction tasks, the importance of dataset quality and quantity, and the structure of the Backpropagation-ANN (BP-ANN) model used in the study.

However, it does mention that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was used for training the BP-ANN model, which might provide some functionality for postprocessing and evaluation. Nevertheless, the specific steps involved in postprocessing are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to the query, and I would recommend referring to the original study or the 'neuralnet' package documentation for more information on the postprocessing steps involved.
