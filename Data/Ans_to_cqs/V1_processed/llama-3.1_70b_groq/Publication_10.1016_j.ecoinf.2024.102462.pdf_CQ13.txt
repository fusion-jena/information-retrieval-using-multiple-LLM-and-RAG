Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only provides a general overview of the deep learning approach, its methodology, and the use of ResNet as a specific architecture. It does not delve into the details of the hyperparameters used in the model.

However, it does mention that the parameters of the model are adjusted following an optimization process, but it does not specify which optimizer is used. Additionally, it mentions that the model is trained using annotated data and that the evaluation of the network is performed by feeding it an independent data set not seen during training, but it does not provide information on the learning rate or other hyperparameters.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
