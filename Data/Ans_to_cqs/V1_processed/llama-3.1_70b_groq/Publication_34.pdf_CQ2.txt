The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is designed to efficiently apply neural networks to input data of large size, typically 2D or 3D arrays, like images. This suggests that the data format used in the pipeline is likely to be image data, possibly in the form of 2D or 3D arrays. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
