The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that Huang and Wang (2006) used a GA-based (Genetic Algorithm-based) feature selection and parameters optimization for support vector machines. This suggests that at least in one of the referenced studies, a genetic algorithm was used for parameter optimization, but it does not provide information on whether grid search, random search, or other methods were used.
