Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the iterative model exploration process, feature selection, and the Bayesian workflow. It mentions the use of visualizations and scores (presented in Figs. 3, 4, and B.11) and discussions and analysis of the results, but it does not provide specific details on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the workflow results include visualizations and scores, and that the observations and results are discussed and analyzed in the text. This suggests that some form of evaluation and analysis is performed after model training, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
