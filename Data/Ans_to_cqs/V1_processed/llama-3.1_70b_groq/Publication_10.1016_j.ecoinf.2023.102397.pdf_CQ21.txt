Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data processing steps, including data preparation, recognizer optimization, and application to the target set. It also mentions the analysis of the target set to detect differences among software programs in evaluating results. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps after model training. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved in this study.
