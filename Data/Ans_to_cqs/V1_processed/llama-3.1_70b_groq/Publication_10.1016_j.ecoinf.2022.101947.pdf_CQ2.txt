Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the study is primarily image-based. The text mentions the use of digital cameras or smartphones to capture images of footprints, which are then stored on external or cloud-based drives. The images are then analyzed using a machine learning algorithm to classify the sex of the tigers.

There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the study. Additionally, while CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not explicitly mentioned, it is possible that the data may be stored or analyzed in a CSV format, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the primary data format used in the study is image-based, specifically digital images of footprints.
