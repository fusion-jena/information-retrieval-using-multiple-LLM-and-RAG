I don't know. The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, and it discusses various machine learning techniques and their performance, but it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the models.
