The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that for ensemble models, 80% of the data was used to train each model, and the remaining 20% was used to validate each model to obtain individual optimized model hyperparameters. This suggests that the data was split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%), but it does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data.
