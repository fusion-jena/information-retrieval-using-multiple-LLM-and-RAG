The deep learning model used in the paper is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python using Lasagne. The hyperparameters used in the model are as follows:

* Learning rate: 0.01 (constant)
* Optimizer: Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent
* Dropout: Applied to the input of the last two layers with a probability of 0.5
* L2-regularization: Applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001
* Number of epochs: 100
* Checkpointing: After each epoch
* Validation set: Used to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy.

These hyperparameters are used to train the CNN model, which is then evaluated on a dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species.
