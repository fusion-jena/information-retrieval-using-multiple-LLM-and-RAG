The text does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset was collected using six different commercial cameras to ensure variability and to develop flexible solutions with real-world conditions in the future. This suggests that the raw data was collected through image capture using cameras, but the specific methods or protocols used for collecting these images are not described in the provided text.
