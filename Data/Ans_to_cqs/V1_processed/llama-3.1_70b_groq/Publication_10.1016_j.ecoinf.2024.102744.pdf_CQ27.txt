Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the classification network, as well as the experimental setup and evaluation metrics. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection.

However, it does mention that the experiments were conducted using Python 3.10, along with popular libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. This suggests that the model may have been deployed using one of these frameworks, but the specific details of the deployment process are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
