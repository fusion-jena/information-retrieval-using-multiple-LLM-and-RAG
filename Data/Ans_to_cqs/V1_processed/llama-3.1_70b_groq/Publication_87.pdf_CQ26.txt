The provided context does not explicitly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning for image classification and the importance of collecting diverse data.

One of the papers, "Deep Learning for Environmental Conservation" by Lamba et al. (2019), mentions the use of camera traps to collect images of animals, which could be a form of diverse data collection. However, it does not discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias.

Another paper, "How Transferable Are Features in Deep Neural Networks?" by Yosinski et al. (2014), discusses the transferability of features in deep neural networks, but it does not address data bias specifically.

The other papers provided do not discuss deep learning preprocessing techniques or data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, I can suggest that diverse data collection, as mentioned in the paper by Lamba et al. (2019), could be one technique used to address data bias. Other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are commonly used in deep learning preprocessing, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
