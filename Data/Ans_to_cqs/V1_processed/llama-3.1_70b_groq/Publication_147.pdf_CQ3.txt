The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study uses "photo interpretation" to generate one of the data sets, which suggests that some form of manual annotation or labeling may be involved. Additionally, the study uses "patch-level" training for the CNNs, which implies that the data may be divided into smaller patches or segments for annotation and training purposes.

The context also mentions that the CNNs learn "low- and high-level features" from the remote sensing data, including "waterline edges" and "subtle variations in texture or color". This suggests that the annotation techniques may involve identifying and labeling specific features or objects within the data, such as waterlines or different types of wetland vegetation.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
