Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, hyperspectral imagery, and invasive species detection, with references to various research papers and techniques. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
