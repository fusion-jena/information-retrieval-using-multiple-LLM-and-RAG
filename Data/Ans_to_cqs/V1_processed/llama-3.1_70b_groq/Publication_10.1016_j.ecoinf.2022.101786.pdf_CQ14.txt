The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "Some model parameters were modified from the default configuration to balance use of resources and training speed" and that "Other parameters were kept to default or set according to guidance by the developers". This suggests that the hyperparameters were adjusted manually or based on the developers' guidance, but it does not provide information on whether a systematic search (e.g., grid search, random search) was performed to optimize the hyperparameters.
