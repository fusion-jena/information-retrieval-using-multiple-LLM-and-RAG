The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mentioned applications and tasks, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, time series forecasting, and land cover/land use classification, it can be inferred that the following data formats might be used:

* Sequential data: This could include time series data, such as CSV files, or sequential data like text or speech.
* Image data: This might be used for land cover/land use classification tasks.
* Audio data: This could be used for speech recognition tasks.

However, it is essential to note that the context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, this answer is based on inference and might not be entirely accurate.
