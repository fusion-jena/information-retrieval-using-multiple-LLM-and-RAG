The pipeline uses a combination of deep learning models. Specifically, it uses a PointNet network for superpoint embedding and a graph convolution network for segmenting the point clouds based on context. Additionally, a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) is also mentioned as part of the network for superpoint embedding and segmentation.
