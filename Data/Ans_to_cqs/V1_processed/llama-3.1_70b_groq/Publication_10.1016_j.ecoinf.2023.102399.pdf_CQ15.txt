Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only discusses the use of a deep neural network for fish biomass estimation, the comparison of model effects between DL-YOLO and YOLOv5n, and the conclusion that the proposed method has minimized the workload and complexity of image preprocessing. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during the training process.
