Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on crowdsourcing biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers using an app called Dive Reporter. It discusses the app's usability, the collection of metadata, and the calculation of weighted normalised abundance, but it does not mention deep learning models or their evaluation metrics.

Therefore, I don't know what metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model in this context, as it is not mentioned in the provided text.
