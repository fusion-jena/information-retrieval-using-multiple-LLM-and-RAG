I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods or deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to data processing, metadata, and data synthesis in the field of earth system science, specifically in the context of FLUXNET and other environmental datasets. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning techniques, and therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
