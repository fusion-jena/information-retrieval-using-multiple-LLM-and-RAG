Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It does mention the use of a deep learning classifier that optimizes the use of phenological information yielded from Ppf-CM, and that it was able to capture and exploit more complex information with its deep network structure and strong self-learning ability. However, it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset.
