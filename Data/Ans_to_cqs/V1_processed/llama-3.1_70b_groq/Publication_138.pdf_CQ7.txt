Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the ICSNet model, its layers, and the techniques used to improve its performance, such as pooling, LRN, and dropout. It also provides some background information on other deep learning models like LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet.

However, in general, the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training typically include:

* Random splitting: The data is randomly divided into training, validation, and testing sets.
* Stratified splitting: The data is split in a way that maintains the same proportion of classes in each set.
* K-fold cross-validation: The data is divided into k folds, and each fold is used as a validation set while the remaining folds are used for training.

The specific criteria used for splitting the data in the context of the ICSNet model are not mentioned, and it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer based on the provided information.
