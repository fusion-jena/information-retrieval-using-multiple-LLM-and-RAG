The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the training dataset for the CNN classifier consists of 80 Ã— 80-pixel image patches of Ziziphus lotus shrubs and Bare soil with sparse vegetation. The dataset is divided into 80 images for training and 20 images for validation for each class. The context also mentions that the training-zone dataset contains 100 Ziziphus lotus patches and 100 Bare soil and sparse vegetation patches. 

It is worth noting that the context mentions the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC), which suggests that the authors may be familiar with the ImageNet dataset. However, it is not explicitly stated that the ImageNet dataset is used in the deep learning pipeline.
