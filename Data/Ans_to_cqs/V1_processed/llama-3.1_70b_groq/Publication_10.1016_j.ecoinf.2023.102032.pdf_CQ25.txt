Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. However, based on the context, it appears to be related to wetland mapping and monitoring using remote-sensing-derived environmental variables and artificial intelligence.

The context mentions a study on national wetland mapping using remote-sensing-derived environmental variables, archive field data, and artificial intelligence (Chambaud et al., 2023). It also mentions the use of Sentinel-2 data for earth observation. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of monitoring wetland health and the impact of land system changes on wetlands.

Given this information, it is possible that the deep learning model is used for classification or detection tasks, such as identifying wetland areas, classifying land use classes, or detecting changes in wetland health. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely related to classification or detection tasks, but the exact purpose is not specified in the provided context.
