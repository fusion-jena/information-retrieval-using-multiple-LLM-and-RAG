Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training and validation process, including techniques like k-fold cross-validation, multistage training, and data augmentation.

However, it does mention the evaluation of the model's performance on the test dataset and the validation dataset. It also mentions the calculation of accuracy, as the model is retrained until it yields the highest accuracy possible on the validation and test datasets.

Additionally, the context mentions the identification of misclassified images in the validation dataset and the swapping of these images with the training images to retrain the model. This process is repeated until the model adapts to the specific target task.

Overall, while the context provides some information on the evaluation of the model's performance, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
