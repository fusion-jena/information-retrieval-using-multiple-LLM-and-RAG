The deep learning model is built using the Keras and TensorFlow frameworks. Specifically, the model is implemented using Keras, which is a high-level neural networks API, and TensorFlow, which is a low-level framework for large-scale machine learning. The computation is performed using CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory.
