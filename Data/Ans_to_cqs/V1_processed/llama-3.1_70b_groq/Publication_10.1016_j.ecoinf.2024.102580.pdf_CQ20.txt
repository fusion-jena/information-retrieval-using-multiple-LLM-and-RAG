The hardware resources used for training the deep learning models are:

* For U-Net training: Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU (5120 CUDA core/16GB HBM2/7.5 TFlops double precision) on the Dragon 2 cluster hosted at the University of Mons, Belgium.
* For DETR training: 2 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti graphics cards on a Personal Computer running Ubuntu 18.04.

Additionally, the Intel Skylake 12-cores Xeon 6126 processor at 2.6 GHz was used for U-Net training, and the 28-core Intel i9-7940Ã— CPU was used for DETR training.
