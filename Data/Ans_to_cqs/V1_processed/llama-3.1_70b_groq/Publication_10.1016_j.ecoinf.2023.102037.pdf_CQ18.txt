The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to split the data on the sticky plate level, where individual insects that belonged to the same sticky plate image were kept together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). This approach allows for validating the model's performance by emulating the way it will be used in practice, predicting a class for any given object it detects on unseen sticky plate images â€“ data it never saw during training.
