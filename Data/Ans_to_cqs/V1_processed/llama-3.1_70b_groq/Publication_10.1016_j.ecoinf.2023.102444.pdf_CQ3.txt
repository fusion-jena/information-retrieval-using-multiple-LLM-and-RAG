Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on dimensionality reduction methods (DRM), particularly UMAP, and its applications in various fields, including species distribution modeling, population genetics, and visualization of multivariate data.

However, it does mention the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in species distribution modeling based on remote sensing imagery, but it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query regarding the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
