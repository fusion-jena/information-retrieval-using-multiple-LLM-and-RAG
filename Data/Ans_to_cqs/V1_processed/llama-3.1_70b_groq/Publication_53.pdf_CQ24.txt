The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention that the researchers used Python and the fastai library for developing the deep learning CNN. 

In general, deep learning frameworks like fastai often provide mechanisms to handle randomness, such as setting a random seed value for reproducibility. However, without more specific information, it is unclear what strategies were employed in this particular study.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that the researchers randomly sampled locations in each State and Territory to download RGB images for analysis. This suggests that randomness was introduced in the data collection process, but the specific strategies used to handle this randomness are not mentioned.
