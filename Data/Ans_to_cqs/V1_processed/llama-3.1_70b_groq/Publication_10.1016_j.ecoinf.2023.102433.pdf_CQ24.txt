Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on various topics related to remote sensing, agriculture, and IoT-enabled smart farming applications, as well as some general information on deep learning with PyTorch.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as weight initialization, dropout, and data shuffling. To ensure reproducibility and consistency in results, it is common to set a random seed value, which can be used to initialize the random number generator. This way, the same sequence of random numbers will be generated every time the code is run, ensuring that the results are reproducible.

Additionally, some deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, provide built-in mechanisms for controlling randomness, such as setting the random seed value or using deterministic algorithms. However, without more specific information on the deep learning pipeline in question, it is difficult to provide more detailed advice on handling randomness.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, setting a random seed value is a common approach to ensuring reproducibility and consistency in results.
