The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Mask R-CNN model, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it is a combination of Faster R-CNN and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) models with some advancements. The model uses a ResNet backbone structure, either ResNet 50 or ResNet 101, and is trained using a batch size that is a product of the number of GPUs and images per GPU. The model is used for instance segmentation tasks and produces both bounding box and mask outputs.
