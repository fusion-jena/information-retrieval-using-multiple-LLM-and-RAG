Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the development of two novel deep learning networks, one using semi-supervised contrastive learning and one weakly-supervised model, and their performance in terms of labeling time, training time, turnaround time, and accuracy. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
