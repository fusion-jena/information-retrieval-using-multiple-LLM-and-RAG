Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the LaDeco platform, its functionality, and the computational efficiency of the system. It discusses the use of pre-trained models, threshold settings, and output formats but does not delve into data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know what specific data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline of LaDeco.
