Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the importance of training data, domain adaptation, and neural network architectures for semantic image segmentation. It does mention adjusting the loss function to ignore certain parts of the image, but this is not a regularization method.

However, it does mention that neural networks can be trained in a supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised way, and that various neural network architectures like UNet and DeepLabV3 were developed for semantic image segmentation. But it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in these architectures.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
