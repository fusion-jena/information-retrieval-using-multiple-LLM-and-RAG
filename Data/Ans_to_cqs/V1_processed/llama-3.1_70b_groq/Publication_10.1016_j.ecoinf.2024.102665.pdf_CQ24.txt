Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on coral reef research, cluster analysis, and Bayesian networks, with no direct mention of deep learning pipelines or randomness handling.

However, one of the papers mentioned, "Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming" by Do and Tran (2023), might potentially discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, the provided context does not include the relevant information from this paper.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
