Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of satellite images from various sources, including Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A. The specific details of the satellite images used are provided in Table 1, which includes information on the satellite, time, cloud cover, strip numbers, and data sources.

The data sources listed include:

* https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ (for Landsat-8)
* https://data.cresda.cn/ (for GF-1)
* https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/ (for Sentinel-2A)

These sources suggest that the raw data collection methods involve accessing publicly available satellite image datasets, rather than collecting data through surveys or sensors.
