Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance comparison of different models, hyperparameter optimization, and the effectiveness of fine-tuning pre-trained models. It does not provide information on the deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection.

However, it does mention that the experimental analysis revealed that the Fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model exhibited superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.12%. But it does not provide further details on how this model was deployed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
