The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It mentions the use of Nvidia Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs for training the models, but it does not specify the deep learning framework used. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning models.
