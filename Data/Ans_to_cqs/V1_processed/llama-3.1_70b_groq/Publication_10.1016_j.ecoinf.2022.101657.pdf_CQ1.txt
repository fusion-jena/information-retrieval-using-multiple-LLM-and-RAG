In the context of camera trapping for biodiversity monitoring, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include the use of camera traps with motion sensors (PIR) that capture images of animals in their natural habitats. These camera traps can be equipped with AI-powered systems that can filter out empty images, reducing the amount of useless data being collected.

Additionally, some studies have used video clips obtained from camera traps to train deep learning models for instance segmentation of animal species. For example, Schindler and Steinhage (2021) used a combination of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in video clips.

Other methods for collecting raw data may include the use of public datasets, such as those obtained from camera trap surveys or citizen science projects. However, the provided context does not provide specific information on the use of surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the development of bespoke neural networks for species sets, which may involve collecting raw data specific to the species of interest. However, the specific methods used for collecting this data are not specified in the provided context.
