The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Learning rate (lr): 0.0001
* Optimizer: Adaptive ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
* Batch size: 256
* Number of epochs: 90 (which corresponds to 16,290 iterations)
* Activation functions: 
  - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for the convolutional layers
  - ELU (Exponential Linear Unit) for the fully connected layer

These hyperparameters were used to train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch, as the authors decided that pre-trained models were not suitable for their specific classification problem.
