The provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model, but it does provide information on the performance evaluation of two classification models: kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) and RF (Random Forest). 

For both models, the performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Overall accuracy: This is the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances.
2. Overall producer's accuracy: This is the proportion of correctly classified instances for each class.
3. Kappa statistics: This is a measure of agreement between the predicted and actual classes, taking into account the chance agreement.
4. 95% Confidence Interval (CI): This provides a range of values within which the true accuracy is likely to lie.

Additionally, the context provides a confusion matrix for each model, which shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class. However, precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
