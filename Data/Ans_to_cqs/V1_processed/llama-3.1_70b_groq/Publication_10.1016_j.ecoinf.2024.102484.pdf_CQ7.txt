Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a study on soil degradation and land-use types, and it does not provide information on data splitting for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
