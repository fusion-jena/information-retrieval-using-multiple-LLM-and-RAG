To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the techniques used in the provided context include:

1. **Random augmentation**: The presence spectrograms are randomly augmented by applying a time-shift operation to generate enough synthetic spectrograms, ensuring that the number of spectrograms in both classes are equal. This helps to overcome class imbalance issues.

No other techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection are mentioned in the provided context.
