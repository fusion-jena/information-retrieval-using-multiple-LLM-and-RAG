Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a different topic, discussing parameters and variables related to a model, possibly in the field of ecology or environmental science. There is no mention of deep learning, data bias, or preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
