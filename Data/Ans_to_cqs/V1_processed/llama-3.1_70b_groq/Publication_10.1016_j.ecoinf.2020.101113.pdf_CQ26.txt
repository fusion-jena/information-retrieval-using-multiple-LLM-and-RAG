The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "data augmentation" as a potential method to improve performance, particularly for rare species. Data augmentation involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by adding noise or other transformations to the existing data. This can help to reduce the impact of data bias, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique used to address data bias in the context.

Additionally, the context mentions that the training data was collected directly from soundscapes, which may reduce the need for data augmentation. However, it is not clear if this approach is sufficient to address data bias.

Other techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm if these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the only technique mentioned in the context that could potentially address data bias is data augmentation, but its specific application and effectiveness in addressing data bias are not clear.
