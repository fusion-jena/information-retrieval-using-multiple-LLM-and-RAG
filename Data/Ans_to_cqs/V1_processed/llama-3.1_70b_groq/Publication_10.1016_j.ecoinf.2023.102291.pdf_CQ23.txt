The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained and validated using a dataset, and that the validation accuracy and precision were used to evaluate the model's performance. 

It is mentioned that the model was trained on a dataset with a size of 32, and that the model was trained for 50 epochs using the Adam optimizer. However, it is not clear if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

It is also mentioned that the dataset used for transfer learning comprised 3900 images, combining two seconds window size and 90 dpi. However, it is not clear if this dataset was diverse and representative of the population.

Therefore, based on the provided text, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
