None of the provided context mentions the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context actually mentions the use of XGBoost and LightGBM, which are gradient boosting frameworks, but not deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I don't know which deep learning frameworks are used to build the model, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
