Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and ecological niche analysis, and it discusses topics such as model performance evaluation, niche overlap, and predictor selection. However, it does not provide information on deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
