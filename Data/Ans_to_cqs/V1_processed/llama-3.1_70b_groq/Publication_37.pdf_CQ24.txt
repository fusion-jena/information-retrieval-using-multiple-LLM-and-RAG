The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of dropout with a probability of 0.5 in the last two layers of the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of neurons to zero during training, which can help prevent overfitting and introduce randomness in the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent for training the model, which involves randomly sampling a subset of the training data (a mini-batch) to compute the gradient of the loss function. This can also introduce randomness in the training process.

However, it is not clear if a fixed random seed value is used to ensure reproducibility of the results. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to this question.
