The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it mentions that the training stops at the best epoch previously determined on the validation set (epoch 69). This suggests that the training is stopped based on the performance on the validation set, but the specific criteria used to determine the best epoch are not specified.
