Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on machine learning classification techniques for grassland management and conservation, using remote sensing data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). It mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) technique for classification, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
