The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the grid search method. According to the text, "the grid search approach is widely used to optimize a model by comparing the values of evaluation metrics for different parameters and selecting the optimal parameters from a large search space." This method involves comparing the values of evaluation metrics for different hyperparameter combinations and selecting the optimal parameters from the search space. In this study, the grid search method was used to optimize five of the MLP model's hyperparameters, including the number of neural network layers, the number of neurons per layer, dropout, learning rate, and batch size. The tuning ranges for these hyperparameters are specified in Table 1.
