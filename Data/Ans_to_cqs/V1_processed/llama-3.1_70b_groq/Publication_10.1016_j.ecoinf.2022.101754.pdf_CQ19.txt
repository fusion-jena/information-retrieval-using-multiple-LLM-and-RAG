I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of deep learning and machine learning methods, such as AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these methods.
