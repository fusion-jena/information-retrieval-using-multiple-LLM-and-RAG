Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model selection, parametrization, and performance evaluation of various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification task.

However, it does mention that the images were resized to the same resolution and normalized to the [0,1] range, which is a common preprocessing step. Additionally, the context mentions the use of an early stop approach with a patience value of 16 to regularize the model and minimize the loss function, which can help prevent overfitting.

But, it does not provide information on techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias. Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in this study.
