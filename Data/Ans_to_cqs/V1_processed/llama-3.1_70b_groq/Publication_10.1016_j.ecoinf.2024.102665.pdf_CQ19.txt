I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that a deep learning model was combined with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming, as described in the paper by Do and Tran (2023). However, it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the model.
