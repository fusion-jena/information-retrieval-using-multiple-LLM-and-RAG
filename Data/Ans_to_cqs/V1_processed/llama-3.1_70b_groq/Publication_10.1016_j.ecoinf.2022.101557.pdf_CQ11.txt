I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for annotating wetlands on a map, data pre-processing, and model training, but it does not provide information on where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared.
