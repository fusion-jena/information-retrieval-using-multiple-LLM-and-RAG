According to the provided context, one preprocessing step involved before training a machine learning model is data standardization. Specifically, the study adopted Z score normalization techniques to standardize the WQ indicator data. The Z score formula is used to convert all variables to a uniform scale, which optimizes the model error. The formula is:

Z = (Xi - X) / σ

where Z is the standardized score, Xi is the ith variable of WQ indicator dataset, X is the mean value of WQ indicator data, and σ is the standard deviation of WQ indicator data.

Additionally, the context mentions data splitting as another preprocessing step, where the WQ indicator data is divided into training and testing datasets. In this study, an 80% and 20% ratio is used for splitting the training and testing datasets.

It is worth noting that the context does not specifically mention deep learning models, but rather machine learning models in general. However, the preprocessing steps mentioned (data standardization and data splitting) are commonly used in deep learning as well. Other preprocessing steps such as cleaning are not mentioned in the provided context.
