Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and the R programming language for statistical computing. However, it does not provide information on the specific framework used to implement the DCNN. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
