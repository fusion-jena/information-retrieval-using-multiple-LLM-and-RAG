The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the references and studies mentioned, it appears that the deep learning models are used for various tasks such as classification, segmentation, and mapping.

For example, the study by Olatunji (2019) uses a neural network and support vector machine for the prediction of chronic kidney disease, which is a classification task. The study by Aryal (2020) uses deep learning for glacier segmentation in satellite images, which is a segmentation task. The study by Bazzi et al. (2019) uses Sentinel-1 SAR time series for mapping paddy rice, which is a mapping task.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of support vector machines (SVMs) for classification tasks, such as in the study by Gola et al. (2019) for objective microstructure classification. The context also mentions the use of remote sensing proxies and breakpoint approach for estimating information on the onset of grass aging, which could be a detection task.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model in question.
