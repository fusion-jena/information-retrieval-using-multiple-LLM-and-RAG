Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the model architecture (YOLOv5s), the number of epochs (100), batch size (32), and input image dimension (640 Ã— 640). It also mentions the use of default data augmentation, but it does not provide information on the learning rate and optimizer used during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
