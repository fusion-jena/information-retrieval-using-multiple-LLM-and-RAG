I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. It appears to be discussing a study on climate change and species distribution modeling, using techniques such as committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create ensemble models. The context mentions metrics such as AUC and TSS for evaluating model performance, but it does not mention deep learning or its applications. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
