The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the training was conducted over 500 epochs with a learning rate that was halved every 20 rounds to optimize performance. This suggests that the training process was designed to run for a fixed number of epochs, with adjustments to the learning rate to improve convergence. It does not provide information on any specific stopping criteria, such as a validation loss plateau, that may have been used to determine when training was complete.
