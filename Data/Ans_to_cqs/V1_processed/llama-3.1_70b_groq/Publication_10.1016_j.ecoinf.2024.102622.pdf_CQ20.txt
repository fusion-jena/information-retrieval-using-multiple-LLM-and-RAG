Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, ecological informatics, and machine learning applications in agriculture, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the models.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the context.
