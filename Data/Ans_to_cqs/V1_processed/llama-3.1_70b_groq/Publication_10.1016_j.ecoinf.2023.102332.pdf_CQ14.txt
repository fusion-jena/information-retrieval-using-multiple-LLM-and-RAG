Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the use of pre-trained word2vec models, specifically the baroni word2vec model, and the process of extracting unigrams from text data, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
