I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The references listed appear to be academic papers and do not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
