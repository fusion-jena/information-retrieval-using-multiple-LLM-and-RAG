Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of the XGBoost model for land use/land cover classification, forest type classification, and forest fire risk assessment using remote sensing data. It mentions the use of high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this context.
