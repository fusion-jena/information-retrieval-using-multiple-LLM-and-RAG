The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is object detection and action recognition. Specifically, the Mask R-CNN model is used for object detection, and the three ResNet variants are used for action recognition. The Mask R-CNN model is composed of three main parts: the backbone, the region proposal, and the head, and it is used to detect objects in images. The ResNet variants, on the other hand, are trained for action recognition tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a flow network, specifically SPyNet, in the FGFA architecture, which is likely used for optical flow estimation, but the primary purpose of the models is object detection and action recognition.
