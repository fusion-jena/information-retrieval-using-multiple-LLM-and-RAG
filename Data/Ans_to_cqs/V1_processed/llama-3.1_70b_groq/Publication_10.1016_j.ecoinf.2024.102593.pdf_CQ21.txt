The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the proposed method of using model embeddings and dimensionality reduction to display model predictions in EV can contribute to selecting the best sample candidates for manual annotation.

Additionally, the context mentions that acoustic models can facilitate post-processing of results, error detection, input selection, and the detection of rare events. It also mentions that the reader can experience online examples with publicly available code, but it does not provide specific details about the post-processing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the post-processing steps involved after model training.
