Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training dataset, model architecture, and training process, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention the use of a validation dataset to validate the obtained CNN classifiers, as shown in Table 1. This suggests that some form of evaluation or assessment is performed after the model training, but the specific details of these steps are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
