I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. In fact, the context does not mention deep learning models at all. It discusses the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.
