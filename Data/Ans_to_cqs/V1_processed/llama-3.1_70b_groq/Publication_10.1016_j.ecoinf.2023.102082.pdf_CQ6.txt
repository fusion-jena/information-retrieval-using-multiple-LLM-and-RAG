Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context only mentions that a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) was used to create a high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images. It also mentions that a deep learning algorithm was used to fuse GEDI data and Sentinel-2 images to derive a finer spatial resolution for Lang10m.

However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps might have been involved, such as data cleaning, normalization, or scaling, as these are common steps in preparing data for deep learning models. But without explicit information, it is impossible to provide a detailed answer.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in this context.
