The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the validation dataset and the model segmented 1195 objects, which suggests that instance segmentation might be one of the techniques used. Additionally, the context mentions semantic segmentation, which is a technique used to classify each pixel in an image into a specific class or category. 

The context also mentions the use of U-net, a deep learning architecture commonly used for image segmentation tasks. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used to prepare the data for training the U-net model.

Therefore, while we can infer that instance segmentation and semantic segmentation might be involved, we cannot provide a definitive answer on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
