The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the "Result output" step, which includes segmenting the point cloud test set and obtaining the final segmentation results. The output files include point cloud geometric partition graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of metrics such as overall accuracy (OA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) to evaluate the performance of the model. It also provides tables showing the test results with different parameter settings, which suggests that some form of metrics calculation is involved.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to the query based on the available information.
