I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the application of deep learning techniques in image classification, the growing computing capability of machines, and the availability of big data, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
