I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of different deep learning models (Unet, Pspnet, and Deeplabv3+) for generating high-precision Fractional Vegetation Coverage (FVC) in drylands with high-resolution remote sensing images, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
