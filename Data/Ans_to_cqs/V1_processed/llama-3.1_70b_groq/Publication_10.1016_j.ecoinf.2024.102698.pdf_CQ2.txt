Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), it can be inferred that the data formats used might be image-related, as these types of networks are commonly used for image processing tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of spatial distributions and site areas, which could suggest the use of geospatial data formats such as GeoJSON or shapefiles. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
