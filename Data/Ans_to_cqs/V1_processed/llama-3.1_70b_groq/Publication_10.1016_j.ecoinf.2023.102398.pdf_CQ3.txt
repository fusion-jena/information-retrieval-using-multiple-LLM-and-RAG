Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation is used in the pipeline.

The context mentions that the model is trained with a dataset and that the model generates bounding boxes and class names for detected objects (Fig. 12 and Fig. 13). This suggests that the dataset is annotated with bounding boxes around objects of interest, which is a common annotation technique used in object detection tasks.

However, there is no mention of instance segmentation, which is another common annotation technique used in computer vision tasks. Instance segmentation involves annotating each pixel in an image with a class label and an instance ID, which allows for more precise localization and recognition of objects.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation is used in the pipeline, but it is unclear if instance segmentation or other annotation techniques are used.
