The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It appears to focus on the evaluation of the models' performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F-score, and confidence intervals after the training process. The context discusses the results of the evaluation, comparing the performance of different models (FRCNN, TPH-YOLOv5, YOLOv5s, and YOLOv5m) on various sites and backgrounds.

However, it can be inferred that the evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F-score, and confidence intervals) might be used to monitor the model's performance during training, but this is not explicitly stated. The context does not provide information on the specific strategy or techniques used to monitor the model's performance during the training process.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
