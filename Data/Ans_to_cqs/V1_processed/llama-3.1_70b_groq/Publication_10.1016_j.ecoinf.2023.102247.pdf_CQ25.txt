I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. It discusses an ensemble modeling approach using BIOMOD2 package in R, which combines four different models (regression-based, Maximum Entropy, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines) to predict the distribution of a study species. The context also mentions the use of cross-validation to test model performance and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as a measure of model accuracy. However, it does not mention deep learning or its application in the study.
