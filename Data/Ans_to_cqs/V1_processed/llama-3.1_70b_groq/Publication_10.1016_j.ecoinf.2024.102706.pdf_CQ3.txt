I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses various machine learning models, including LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, and their applications in predicting forest canopy cover from satellite images. It also discusses the hyperparameters and optimization techniques used in these models, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
