The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention addressing imbalance issues in datasets, which can be related to data bias. According to the context, one of the approaches used to address imbalance issues is by increasing the quality of the original real-world datasets, such as addressing imbalance issues (Khanmohammadi et al., 2023b).

Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include:

* Oversampling: creating additional instances of the underrepresented class to balance the dataset
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the overrepresented class to balance the dataset
* Stratified splitting: splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias

However, it is essential to note that these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
