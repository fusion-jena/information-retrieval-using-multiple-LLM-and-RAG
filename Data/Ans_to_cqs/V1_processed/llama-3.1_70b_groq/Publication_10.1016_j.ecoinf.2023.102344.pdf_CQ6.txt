Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the architectures of various pre-trained networks, such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, and their performance on a specific task. It also mentions the use of PCA-NCA integration in Approaches 1 and 3, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved.

However, it can be inferred that the images used in Approach 2 were fed directly into the pre-trained networks without manual feature extraction, suggesting that the networks may have performed some form of preprocessing internally. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
