Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process using the TPEBO algorithm for LSTM neural networks. It discusses the importance of hyperparameters, the TPEBO algorithm's approach, and the ranges set for various hyperparameters. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Therefore, I don't know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
