Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on the performance evaluation of various machine learning models, including CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN, with metrics such as R, RMSE, and MAPE. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If additional context or information is provided, I may be able to offer a more specific response.
