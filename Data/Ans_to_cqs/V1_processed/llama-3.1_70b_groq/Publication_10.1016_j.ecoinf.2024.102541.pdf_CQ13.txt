Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the model's architecture, computational complexity, and performance metrics (e.g., FLOPs, FPS), as well as comparisons with other models. It does not provide information on the training process or hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
