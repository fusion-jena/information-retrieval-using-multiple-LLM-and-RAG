Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that a deep learning LSTM model was used for predicting air quality (Navares, R., Aznarte, J.L., 2020) and that an LSTM deep learning model outperformed others for PM2.5 prediction (Gokul et al., 2023), but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
