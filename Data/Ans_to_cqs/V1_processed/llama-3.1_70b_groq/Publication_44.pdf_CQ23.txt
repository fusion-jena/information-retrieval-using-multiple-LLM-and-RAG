Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the performance of different models, such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5s, and the Proposed Method, on a specific task, but it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, it does mention that the best-performing model was saved based on the validation loss, which suggests that some form of validation was used during the training process. Additionally, the context mentions a "large training sample" required for good performance, which implies that a diverse dataset might have been used. Nevertheless, without more information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this question.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
