Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to describe the architecture and components of a soundscape VAE (Variational Autoencoder) model, but it does not mention the datasets used for training or testing the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
