Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, we can infer some information from the context.

In the paper "Mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at large scale from space with deep learning" by Couttenier et al. (2022), the authors mention that they used a semi-automated reclassification approach that leverages cloud-based machine learning. However, they do not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved.

In the paper "A Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana: applying deep learning to shallow mining" by Elmes et al. (2020), the authors mention that they used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect artisanal small-scale mining. However, they do not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved.

The only preprocessing step mentioned in the context is the removal of isolated, small, misclassified pixels (usually 1-2 pixels in size) by selecting mining pixels above 3 pixel sizes (PROCESS) as mentioned in the 18th point. This step is not a traditional preprocessing step, but rather a post-processing step to refine the results.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
