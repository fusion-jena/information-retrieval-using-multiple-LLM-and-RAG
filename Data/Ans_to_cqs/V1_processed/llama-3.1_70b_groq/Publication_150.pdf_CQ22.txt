The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the provided context are:

1. Top-1 accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances in the test dataset.
2. Top-2 accuracy, Top-3 accuracy, Top-4 accuracy, and Top-5 accuracy: These metrics measure the proportion of instances that are correctly classified within the top 2, 3, 4, and 5 predictions, respectively.
3. Macro recall: This metric measures the average recall across all classes in the test dataset.
4. Macro precision: This metric measures the average precision across all classes in the test dataset.

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different deep learning models, including Wide-ResNet101, InceptionV3, ResNet101, and MnasNet-A1. The results are presented in Table 1, which shows the top-1 accuracy, macro recall, and macro precision for each model.
