The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. According to the text, these metrics were computed for the 21-pixel size, which had the highest accuracy of 83.87%. The text also mentions that the accuracy is a measure of the overall correctness, precision is a measure of how many correctly predicted positive instances there are among all instances predicted as positive, recall measures the ability of the model to capture all the positive instances, and the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
