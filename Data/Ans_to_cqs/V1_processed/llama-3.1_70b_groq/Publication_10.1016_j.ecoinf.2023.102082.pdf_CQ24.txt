Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning approaches, specifically convolutional neural networks, for tasks like creating high-resolution CHMs and assessing biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems. It does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
