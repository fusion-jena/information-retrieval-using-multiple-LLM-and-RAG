The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are correct identification rate and processing time. Specifically, the correct identification rate is mentioned as the primary metric used to evaluate the model's performance in various challenges. For example, in Challenge 1, the overall correct identification rate was 94.3%, and in Challenge 3, the overall correct identification rate was 94.1%. The correct identification rate is also broken down for individual species, with some species achieving 100% correct identification rate and others having lower rates.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a confusion matrix to depict the model's initial results in Challenge 1. A confusion matrix is a common tool used to evaluate the performance of classification models, as it provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of precision, recall, or other metrics beyond correct identification rate and processing time.
