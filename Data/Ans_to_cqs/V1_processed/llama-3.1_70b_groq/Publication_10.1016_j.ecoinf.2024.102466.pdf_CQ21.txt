Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The text only discusses the training stage of different object detection models, comparing their performance in terms of mAP scores, and the effect of dataset noise on the algorithm's performance. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
