Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on various topics such as deep learning frameworks, event-stream processing, and ethology, but does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing techniques for addressing bias.

However, I can provide some general information on common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a representative proportion of each class.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of instances of the minority class to match the number of instances of the majority class.
* Undersampling: decreasing the number of instances of the majority class to match the number of instances of the minority class.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.

It's worth noting that these techniques are not mutually exclusive, and a combination of techniques may be used to address data bias. However, without more specific information from the context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
