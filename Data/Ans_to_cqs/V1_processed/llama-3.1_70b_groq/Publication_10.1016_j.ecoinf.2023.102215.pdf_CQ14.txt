The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the Adam optimizer is used with default hyperparameters, which are: betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1.0 Ã— 10^(-8), and weight_decay = 0. However, it does not provide information on whether these hyperparameters were tuned using grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
