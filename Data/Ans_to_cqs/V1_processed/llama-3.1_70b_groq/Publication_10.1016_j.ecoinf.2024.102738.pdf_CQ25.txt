The purpose of the model is classification. Specifically, it is used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. The model is trained using the Random Forest algorithm and is used to classify satellite images into different LULC classes, such as artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forest, scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation, open spaces with little or no vegetation, and water bodies. The model is trained using training points collected in the field and the inputs of the best dataset, and the resulting LULC maps have a spatial resolution of 30-m pixels.
