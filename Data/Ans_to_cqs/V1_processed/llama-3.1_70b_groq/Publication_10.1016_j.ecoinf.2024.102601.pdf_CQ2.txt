The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of S2 satellite imagery, which suggests that image data is used in the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions the use of spectral data and reflectance composites, which are also related to image data. There is no mention of audio or video data formats. It is also possible that CSV files are used to store and process the data, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the answer is that image data is likely used in the deep learning pipeline, but the exact data formats are not specified.
