The provided context mentions that data augmentation proved to be an efficient way to increase the F1 score in a deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it mentions that for images collected by UAV flights at a constant height above ground, small changes in brightness and zoom can help to improve results significantly. However, it also notes that changing the range in height and width can cause all vegetation to appear too close visually and create confusion for the CNN.

In terms of specific data augmentation techniques, the context mentions "random image cropping and patching" as a data augmentation method, referred to as "Ricap" in the reference [26]. This suggests that techniques such as cropping and patching are being applied to the images.

While the context does not explicitly mention flipping, rotating, or scaling as data augmentation techniques, it does mention that small changes in zoom can help to improve results. This could potentially include scaling as a data augmentation technique.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data augmentation techniques that can be inferred to be applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

* Random image cropping and patching (Ricap)
* Small changes in brightness
* Small changes in zoom (potentially including scaling)

However, it is not possible to confirm whether flipping or rotating are being applied as data augmentation techniques based on the provided context.
