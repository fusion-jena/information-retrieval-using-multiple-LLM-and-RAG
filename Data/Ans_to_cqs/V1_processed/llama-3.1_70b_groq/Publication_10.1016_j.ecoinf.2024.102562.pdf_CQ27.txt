Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text focuses on the development and training of the model, including data annotation, augmentation, and training with ResNet-101 network. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
