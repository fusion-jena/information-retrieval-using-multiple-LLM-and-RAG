Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and applications of deep noise reduction methods, as well as the challenges and limitations of applying these methods to bioacoustics applications. It does not provide detailed information on the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
