Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, ecology, and computer vision applications, with references to MODIS, Landsat, and other satellite imaging datasets. However, these datasets are not typically used in deep learning pipelines for tasks like image classification.

The context does mention some deep learning-related papers, such as "LeafNet: a computer vision system for automatic plant species identification" and "Hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent: plant species identification by using hybrid deep learning". However, these papers do not mention the use of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
