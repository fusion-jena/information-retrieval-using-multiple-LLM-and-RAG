The provided context does not mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. In fact, the context appears to be discussing the use of Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) for species distribution modeling, using camera trap data. There is no mention of deep learning or the specific datasets mentioned in the query. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
