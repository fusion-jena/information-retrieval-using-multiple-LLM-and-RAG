I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, ecological niche models, and resource selection functions, with discussions on data, methods, and results. There is no mention of model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
