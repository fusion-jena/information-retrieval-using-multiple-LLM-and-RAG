Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of transfer learning models, such as BirdNet, for audio classification tasks, and the application of active learning strategies for efficient annotation. It also discusses the evaluation of these models on various datasets.

There is no mention of model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.

If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any points related to the provided context, I'll be happy to help.
