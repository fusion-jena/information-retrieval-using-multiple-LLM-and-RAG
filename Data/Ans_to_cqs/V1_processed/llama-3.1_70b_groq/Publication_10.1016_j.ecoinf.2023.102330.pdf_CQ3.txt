Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the use of data augmentation to estimate the number of non-detections and the application of a Bernoulli distribution to model the total number of calls, including false positives.

However, it is mentioned that the researchers used a data augmentation variable zi,j to indicate whether an observation was a true call or not. This suggests that some form of labeling or annotation was performed on the data, but the specific techniques used are not described.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for acoustic detection, but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used to train the CNN.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
