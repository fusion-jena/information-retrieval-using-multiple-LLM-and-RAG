Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on text processing, data cleaning, and theme perception technology using machine learning methods, specifically the ERNIE model. It discusses text filtering, Chinese text segmentation, and lexical analysis, but does not delve into techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it does mention data cleaning, which includes filtering out unnecessary symbols, noise, and user-generated text that deviates from the theme. This process might help reduce some forms of bias, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The context does not mention Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
