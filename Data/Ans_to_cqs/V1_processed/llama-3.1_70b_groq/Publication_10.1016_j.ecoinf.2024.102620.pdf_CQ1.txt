The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does list various data sources used in the study, which can be inferred as the methods for collecting raw data. These data sources include:

* Remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine (https://code.earthengine.google.com/)
* Vegetation type data from the Resource and Environment Science Data Center (https://www.resdc.cn/)
* Meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite/) and the Copernicus Climate Data Store (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/)
* Road data from OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
* GDP and population data from the Resource and Environment Science Data Center (https://www.resdc.cn/)

It can be inferred that the study utilizes a combination of remote sensing data, publicly available datasets, and existing data repositories as the methods for collecting raw data. However, it does not mention surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data.
