The context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models after training. These metrics include R2 (coefficient of determination), RMSE (root mean square error), and REP (relative error percentage). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models on both the training set and the validation set.
