The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is 3D point cloud data. The pipeline involves converting the point cloud data into superpoints, which are then processed by a network for superpoint embedding and segmentation based on PointNet and GRU. The point cloud data is not converted into traditional formats like images, audio, or video, but rather processed directly as 3D point cloud data. However, it is mentioned that some methods convert point clouds into 2D images and further process the images by CNNs.
