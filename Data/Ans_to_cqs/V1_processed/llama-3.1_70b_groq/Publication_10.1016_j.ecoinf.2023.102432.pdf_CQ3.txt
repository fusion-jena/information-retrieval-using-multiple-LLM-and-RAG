Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on multiple-instance learning, remote sensing, and machine learning approaches, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

However, it does mention that the authors used a random pixel from the pixels in closest proximity to the training location for analysis, which suggests that some form of data selection or sampling was used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of metadata records and spectra, which may imply some form of data labeling or annotation. But the specific techniques used for data annotation are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
