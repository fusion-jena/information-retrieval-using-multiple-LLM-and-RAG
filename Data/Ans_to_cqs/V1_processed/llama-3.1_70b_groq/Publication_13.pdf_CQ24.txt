Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in biodiversity estimation, domain adaptation, and image segmentation, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of scaling the model with the size and complexity of the training data to fully learn the structure of the data. This implies that the authors may be aware of the potential issues with randomness and variability in the data, but they do not provide specific strategies for addressing these issues.

In general, common strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques such as data augmentation and regularization, and employing ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
