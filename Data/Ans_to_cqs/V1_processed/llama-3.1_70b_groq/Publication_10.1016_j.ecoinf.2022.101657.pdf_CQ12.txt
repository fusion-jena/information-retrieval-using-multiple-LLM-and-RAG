Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a neural network for species identification and animal detection, and references several papers related to computer vision and deep learning, including Scaled-YOLOv4 and MobileNetV3. This suggests that the pipeline may be using a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a variant of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
