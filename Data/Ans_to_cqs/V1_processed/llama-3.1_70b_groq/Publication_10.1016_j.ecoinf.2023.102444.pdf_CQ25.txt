The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the model is used for species distribution modeling (SDM), which involves predicting the distribution of species based on environmental variables. The context mentions that Deneu et al. (2022) used a convolutional neural network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution, suggesting that the model is used for classification or regression tasks, such as predicting the presence or absence of a species in a given area. However, without more information, the exact purpose of the deep learning model cannot be determined.
