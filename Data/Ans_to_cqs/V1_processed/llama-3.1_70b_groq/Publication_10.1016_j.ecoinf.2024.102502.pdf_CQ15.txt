Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on data filtering, scaling, and processing using Google Earth Engine (GEE), but it does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
