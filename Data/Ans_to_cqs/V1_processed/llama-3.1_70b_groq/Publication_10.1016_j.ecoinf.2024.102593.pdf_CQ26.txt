The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the challenges of working with scarce and unbalanced datasets in the bioacoustics field.

The context mentions the use of active learning to progressively increase the training data by selecting samples most likely to improve model performance. This approach can help to reduce the extent of manual annotation and may help to address data bias by selecting a more diverse set of samples.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of dimensionality reduction to display model predictions in a lower-dimensional space, which can help to identify patterns and relationships in the data. However, this is not a technique specifically used to address data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as techniques used to address data bias. It also does not discuss diverse data collection as a technique to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be said that active learning is one approach that may help to address data bias by selecting a more diverse set of samples.
