Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to environmental science, hydrology, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. If you have any additional information or context, I would be happy to try and help further.
