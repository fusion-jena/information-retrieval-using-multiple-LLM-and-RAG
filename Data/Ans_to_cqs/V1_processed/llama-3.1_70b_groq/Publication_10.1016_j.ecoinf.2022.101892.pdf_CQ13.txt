Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only discusses the model architecture, dataset, and experimental setup, but does not provide information on the training hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
