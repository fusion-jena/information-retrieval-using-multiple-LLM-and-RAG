The text does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the model training process involved an iterative approach to extract the weights assigned to the fully connected layers of the model, thus enabling the identification and analysis of evolving patterns in the weights associated with each specific influencing factor. Additionally, it mentions that the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set improved by about 20% after embedding LSTM into the CNN, suggesting that the model's performance was evaluated on a testing set. However, the specific strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training is not mentioned.
