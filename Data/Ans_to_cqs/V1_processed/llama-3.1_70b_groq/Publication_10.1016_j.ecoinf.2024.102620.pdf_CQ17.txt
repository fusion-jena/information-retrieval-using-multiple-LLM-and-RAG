Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land use modeling and cellular automata, and does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
