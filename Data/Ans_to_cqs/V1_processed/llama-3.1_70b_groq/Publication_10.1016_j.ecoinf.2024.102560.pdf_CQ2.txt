I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline. It appears to be a research study focused on analyzing satellite-based datasets, specifically MODIS and CMAP datasets, for drought monitoring and land cover variations. The context mentions the use of various data formats such as images (Landsat frames, MODIS images) and gridded data (CMAP), but it does not provide information on a deep learning pipeline or the specific data formats used in such a pipeline.
