Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of remote sensing data, machine learning techniques, and GIS to create fire risk maps. It discusses the classification of fire risk maps, the use of various machine learning algorithms, and the evaluation of their performance. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
