Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be discussing Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique used for time series alignment, and its application in ecological informatics.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
