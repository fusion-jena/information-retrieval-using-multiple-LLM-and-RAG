The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are:

1. F1-score: This is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the model. The F1-score is a measure of the model's accuracy, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. A higher F1-score indicates better performance.

2. Precision: Although not explicitly mentioned as a standalone metric, precision is mentioned as part of the F1-score calculation. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.

3. Recall: Similar to precision, recall is also mentioned as part of the F1-score calculation. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

4. Training accuracy: This metric is mentioned in the context of evaluating the performance of large deep learning networks, such as ResNetV50 and InceptionNetV3. However, it is noted that high training accuracy does not necessarily translate to high validation F1-score, indicating potential overfitting.

5. Validation F1-score: This metric is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. A lower validation F1-score compared to the training accuracy indicates overfitting.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model and to compare the performance of different architectures.
