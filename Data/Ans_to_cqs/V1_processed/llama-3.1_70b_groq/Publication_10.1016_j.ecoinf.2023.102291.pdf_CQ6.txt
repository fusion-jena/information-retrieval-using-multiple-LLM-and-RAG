Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used, the training process, and the hyperparameters employed. It does mention that the models were trained on datasets with specific characteristics (e.g., 2-second window size, 90 dpi), but it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the data before training.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to apply preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning to the data before training a model. These steps can help improve the stability and performance of the model. But without explicit information in the provided context, we cannot determine the specific preprocessing steps that were used in this case.
