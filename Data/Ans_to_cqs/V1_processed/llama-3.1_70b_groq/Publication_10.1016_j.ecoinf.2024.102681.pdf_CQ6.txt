Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN-LSTM hybrid model, its application to drought propagation time series data, and the benefits of using this model. It does not provide information on data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study.
