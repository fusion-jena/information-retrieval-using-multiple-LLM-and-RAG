Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the configuration and training of various machine learning models, including CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN, as well as their performance evaluation using metrics such as R, RMSE, and MAPE. It also provides details on the hyperparameters and structural architecture of the models.

However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
