Based on the provided context, it appears that after model training, the following postprocessing steps were involved:

1. **Confusion matrix**: A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the performance of the model on the test data. This is mentioned in the text: "Fig. 9 shows a confusion matrix for the test data not seen during training."
2. **Score-to-posterior-probability transformation**: A 10-fold cross-validation was used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function, which provides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observations.

There is no mention of saliency maps or other metrics calculation in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these steps were involved in the postprocessing pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context provides some information about the model training and evaluation, but it does not provide a comprehensive overview of all the postprocessing steps that may have been involved.
