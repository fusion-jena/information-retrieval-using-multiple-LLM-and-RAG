Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks, in improving the predictability of Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM). It also touches on ensemble techniques, including heterogeneous ensemble learning, but does not delve into the details of data splitting for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
