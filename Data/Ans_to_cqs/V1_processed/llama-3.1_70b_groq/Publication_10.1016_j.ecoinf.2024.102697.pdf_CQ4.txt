I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on machine learning methods, specifically random forest models, and their application in remote sensing and wastewater treatment plant influent quality prediction. It also discusses the training methodology used for machine learning models, including cross-validation approaches. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
