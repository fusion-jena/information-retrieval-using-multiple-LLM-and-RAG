The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the calculation of metrics such as True Positive, False Positive, and False Negative, as well as the calculation of Recall (Eq. 2) and Precision (Eq. 3). These metrics are likely used to evaluate the performance of the model.

There is no mention of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these postprocessing steps are involved after model training.

It appears that the primary focus of the postprocessing steps is to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, but the exact steps involved are not fully described in the provided context.
