Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions the use of the pre-trained "ERNIE" model, the LSTM-CNN framework for sentiment analysis, and the HRNet model for semantic segmentation, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used for these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
