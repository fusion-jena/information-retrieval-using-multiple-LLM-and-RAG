Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily discusses the performance of different object detection models, such as Cascade RCNN, FCOS, and Faster RCNN, on a bird detection dataset, as well as the number of training epochs and images used. It does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline, including regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
