The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the new dataset annotated by the partially trained model contains 540 training images and 141 validation images. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or ratio used for the split is not specified. There is no mention of a test set.
