Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, data fusion, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model.

However, it does mention the use of cross-validation accuracy as a metric to evaluate the performance of the model in Section 4.1, specifically in the context of feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. The context mentions that the relationship between the number of features and cross-validation accuracy is depicted in Fig. 12, and that the optimal number of feature combinations is determined based on the highest cross-validation accuracy.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a meta-model (RF) to generate prediction results, and the use of voting to obtain the final classification result. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
