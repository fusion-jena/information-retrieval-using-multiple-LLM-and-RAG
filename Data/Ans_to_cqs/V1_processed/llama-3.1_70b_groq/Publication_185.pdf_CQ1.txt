Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the feasibility of using small datasets to train deep learning models, the architecture of the AlexNet model, and its application in image classification tasks. It also mentions the use of a small-size dataset without data augmentation for experiments, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the experiments might be related to butterfly classification, as mentioned in the keywords section. But the specific methods used for collecting the data are not mentioned. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
