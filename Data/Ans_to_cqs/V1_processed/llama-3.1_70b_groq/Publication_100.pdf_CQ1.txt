The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of optical images and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, which are likely collected through remote sensing technologies such as satellite or airborne sensors. Additionally, it mentions the use of a Norway-wide timber volume map from NIBIO, which suggests that public datasets or existing maps may be used as a source of data. It also mentions the use of vegetation points with a certain height (𝐷𝑧 > 1.3 m), which could be collected through field surveys or other methods, but the specific method is not mentioned.
