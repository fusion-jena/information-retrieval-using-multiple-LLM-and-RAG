Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the performance of the BEiT model, its comparison with other models, and some general information about deep learning techniques. It does not provide specific details about the optimization techniques used in the pipeline.

However, it does mention the use of class weights to address class imbalance, which is a technique used to improve the performance of the model. But it does not provide information about the optimization algorithms used, such as SGD or Adam.

Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
