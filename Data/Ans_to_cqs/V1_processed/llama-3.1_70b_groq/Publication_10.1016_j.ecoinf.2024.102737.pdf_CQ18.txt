Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, results, and discussions related to the upper-, left-, and right-pose models. It provides information on the training and test set sizes, precision results, and some discussions on the initial experiments and their evaluation. However, it does not delve into the specifics of how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
