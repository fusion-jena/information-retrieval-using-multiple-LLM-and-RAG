Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions that a backpropagation learning algorithm was used during the training phase of the MLP ANN model, but it does not provide further details on the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
