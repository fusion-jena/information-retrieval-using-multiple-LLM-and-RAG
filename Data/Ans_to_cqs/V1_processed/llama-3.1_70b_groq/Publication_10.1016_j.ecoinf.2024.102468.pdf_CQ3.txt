Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on audio signal processing and machine learning techniques for detecting whale vocalizations, rather than computer vision or image processing tasks that would typically involve annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

However, the context does mention manual detections of whale calls, which suggests that some form of annotation was performed on the audio data. Specifically, it mentions that Bm-Ant-A calls had the highest number of manual detections, totaling 24,363, while Bm-Ant-Z calls had the lowest, with a total of 2515 manual detections. But it does not provide further details on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
