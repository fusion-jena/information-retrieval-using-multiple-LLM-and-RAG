The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used in classification, as seen in the paper "Understanding data augmentation for classification : when to warp ?" by Wong et al. (2016). 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of subsampling to create limited datasets, as seen in the experiment where the dataset T0 is subsampled to 250 and 500 images per class. However, this is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

The context also mentions the use of meta-transfer learning for few-shot learning, which may be related to addressing data bias, but it is not explicitly stated.

Other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are not mentioned in the provided context. Diverse data collection is also not explicitly mentioned, but the context does mention the creation of a large benchmark for fish recognition in the wild, called Wildfish, which may be related to diverse data collection.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query, and some techniques mentioned in the query are not mentioned at all in the context.
