The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses image data. The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and references ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database. Additionally, the context discusses the classification of species based on traits extracted from images, suggesting that image data is being used. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
