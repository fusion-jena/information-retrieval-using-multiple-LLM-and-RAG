The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps. However, it does mention the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.

According to the context, the overall accuracy (OA) is calculated, and a confusion matrix is created to evaluate the performance of the model. The confusion matrix is used to calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (Grassland, Savanna, and Forest). 

For example, in Table 5, the confusion matrix is shown for the first level of classification using the RGB+EVI2 dataset. The precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for each class, and the overall accuracy (OA) is reported to be 92.8%. 

Therefore, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the context include the calculation of metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy) and the creation of a confusion matrix. However, other postprocessing steps like Saliency maps are not mentioned.
