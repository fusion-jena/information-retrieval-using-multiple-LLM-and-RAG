Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses the use of CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and RFR (Random Forest Regression) models for bathymetry retrieval, and the fine-tuning of model parameters such as 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes' for CART, and 'n_estimators' for RFR. It does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
