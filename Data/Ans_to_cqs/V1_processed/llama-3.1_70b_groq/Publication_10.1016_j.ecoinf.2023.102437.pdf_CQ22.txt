The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R2 (coefficient of determination) as metrics to evaluate the performance of the models. Specifically, it mentions that R2 was >0.5 for all three models (LSTM, Lasso, and RF), with LSTM and Lasso models exhibiting the highest correlation coefficients. Additionally, it provides RMSE values for the three models, but it does not provide a clear explanation of how these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
