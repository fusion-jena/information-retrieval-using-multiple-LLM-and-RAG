Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on cellular automata and machine learning, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning or preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
