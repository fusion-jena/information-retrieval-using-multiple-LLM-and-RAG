The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that CNN approaches require a large corpus of high-quality annotated data, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used. It does mention that features extracted from visual spectrogram representations of foreground species recordings were used to train CNNs, but it does not provide information on how the visual spectrograms were annotated. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
