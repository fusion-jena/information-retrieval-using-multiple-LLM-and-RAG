The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include:

1. Random changes of RGB channels of the original images: This involves applying random changes to each RGB channel, with the absolute value of the change not exceeding 0.1. This is implemented using the "apply_channel_shift" utility function from the Keras package.

2. Random vertical and horizontal flips: This technique provides additional variability to the images used for training and helps reduce overfitting.

It is also mentioned that small random rotations were considered as a potential augmentation technique, but it did not improve the network performance and was therefore not used.

There is no mention of scaling as a data augmentation technique in the provided context.
