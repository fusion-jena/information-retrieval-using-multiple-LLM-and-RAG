The text does not mention the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. In fact, it mentions the use of Weka (Frank et al., 2016) for implementing the Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) cross-validation and the SUS (Sequential Univariate Selection) algorithms. Additionally, it mentions the use of Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) as a supervised classification model, but it does not provide information on the specific framework used to implement it.
