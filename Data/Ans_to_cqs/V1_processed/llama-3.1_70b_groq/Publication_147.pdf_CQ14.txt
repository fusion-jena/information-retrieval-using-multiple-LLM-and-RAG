The hyperparameters of the XGBoost model are optimized using grid search functions. This is mentioned in the provided context, which states that "The XGBoost model parameters were tuned using grid search functions to find the optimal value when judged by the test error metric." This indicates that the model's hyperparameters were systematically varied over a predefined range of values, and the combination of hyperparameters that resulted in the lowest test error was selected as the optimal set.
