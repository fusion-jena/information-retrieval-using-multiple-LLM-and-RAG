According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Random horizontal and vertical flips
2. Random rotations up to thirty degrees
3. Modifications in brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue

These techniques are applied to boost the diversity of the dataset and improve the robustness of the model in different conditions. Additionally, Gaussian noise is also incorporated to further enhance the model's robustness. 

There is no mention of scaling in the provided context, but it is mentioned that the images are reduced to a workable scale of 224 Ã— 224 pixels initially.
