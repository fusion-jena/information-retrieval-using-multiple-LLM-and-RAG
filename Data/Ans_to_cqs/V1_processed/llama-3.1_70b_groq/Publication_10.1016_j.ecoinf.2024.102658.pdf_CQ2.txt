The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or specific data formats used in such a pipeline. It appears to be discussing a study on species distribution models (SDMs) and climate datasets, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
