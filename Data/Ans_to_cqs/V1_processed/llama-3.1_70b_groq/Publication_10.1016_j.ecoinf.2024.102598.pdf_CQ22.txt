The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models (MLMs) are:

1. Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) Curve (AUC)
2. True Skill Statistics (TSS)
3. Kappa
4. Phi
5. Sensitivity
6. Specificity

These metrics are used to assess the predictive capabilities of the MLMs, including their accuracy and reliability. The AUC, TSS, Kappa, and Phi values are used to evaluate the performance of the models, while the Sensitivity and Specificity values are used to assess the model's ability to correctly identify positive and negative cases.

Note that the context does not specifically mention a deep learning model, but rather machine learning models (MLMs) in general. The metrics listed above are used to evaluate the performance of the MLMs, which include Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
