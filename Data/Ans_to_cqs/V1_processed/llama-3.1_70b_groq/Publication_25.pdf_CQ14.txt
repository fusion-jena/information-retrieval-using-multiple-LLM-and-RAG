The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of the full model, which combines self-supervised and hand-annotated datasets, and its limitations in segmenting small clusters of trees. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or other methods are used.
