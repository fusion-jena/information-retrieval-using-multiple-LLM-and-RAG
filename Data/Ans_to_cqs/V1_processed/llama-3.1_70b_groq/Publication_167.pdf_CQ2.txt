The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the input data is likely in a tabular or numerical format, such as CSV, rather than image, audio, or video.

The context mentions that the input data is 40-dimensional, which suggests that it is a numerical representation of various features, such as land use type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables. The use of batch normalization and the calculation of mean and variance also imply that the data is numerical in nature.

Additionally, the context mentions that the data is used to train a deep learning model to predict land use distribution probabilities, which further supports the idea that the data is in a numerical or tabular format. However, without explicit mention of the data format, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
