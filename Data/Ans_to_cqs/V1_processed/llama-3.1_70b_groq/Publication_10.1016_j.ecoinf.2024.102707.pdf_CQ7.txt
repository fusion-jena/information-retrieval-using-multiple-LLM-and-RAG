The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the data was split into training, validation, and test sets, and that there are also specific test sets such as "test-over_time", "test-over_location", and "test-over_source". 

This suggests that the data may have been split based on different factors such as time, location, and source, but the exact criteria used for splitting the data is not specified. The context only provides the mean F1 scores obtained per dataset split, but does not provide further details on how the data was split.
