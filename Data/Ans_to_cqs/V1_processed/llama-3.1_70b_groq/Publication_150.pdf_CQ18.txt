The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the models were trained for 150 epochs and the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10 after steps of 30 epochs. This suggests that the model performance was likely monitored at certain intervals (every 30 epochs) to adjust the learning rate, but the specific metrics or methods used to monitor performance are not mentioned.
