Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the SDP-EPL model was trained for up to 400 epochs, with incremental generation of presence and absence data every 100 epochs. Additionally, it mentions that the AUC of SDP-EPL on the validation set was used to select the value of K (the number of iterations) empirically.

It can be inferred that the performance on the validation set, specifically the AUC, was used as a metric to evaluate the model's performance during training. However, it is not clear if a specific stopping criterion, such as a plateau in validation loss, was used to determine when training was complete.
