Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the model's parameters and settings, such as the Model Proportion for best fitting, MS (maximum number of segments used for fitting), and RT (threshold of the fast recovery event). It also briefly mentions the accuracy evaluation, but does not provide details on the specific postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
