Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on evaluating the performance of different models (DCT-PLS, ESTARFM, SOWCEM) using metrics such as R2, MAE, RMSE, and ERGAS. It also provides formulas for calculating some of these metrics.

However, I can suggest some common postprocessing steps that are typically involved after model training, although I must emphasize that these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context:

1. Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc. to evaluate the performance of the model.
2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It provides a summary of predictions against actual outcomes.
3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are used to visualize the importance of input features in predicting the output. They can help identify which features are most relevant to the model's predictions.
4. Model interpretation: This involves analyzing the model's predictions to understand how it is making decisions. Techniques such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, and SHAP values can be used for model interpretation.
5. Model refinement: Based on the results of the evaluation metrics and model interpretation, the model can be refined by tuning hyperparameters, selecting different features, or using different algorithms.

Again, I must emphasize that these are general postprocessing steps and not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
