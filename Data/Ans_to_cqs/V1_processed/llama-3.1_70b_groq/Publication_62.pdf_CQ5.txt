The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being applied to digitized natural history collections (NHCs) and specifically to classify images of unstained/stained and clubmoss/spikemoss specimens. 

It can be inferred that the datasets used are likely custom datasets created from the digitized natural history collections, rather than publicly available datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context mentions that the billions of specimens in NHCs could provide greater social and scientific insight, suggesting that the datasets are derived from these collections.
