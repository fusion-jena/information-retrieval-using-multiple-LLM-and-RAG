Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, specifically the use of the MaxEnt model to estimate the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables to the distribution of certain plant species. It discusses the results of the model, including the percentage contribution and permutation importance of various variables, but does not mention anything about deep learning or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
