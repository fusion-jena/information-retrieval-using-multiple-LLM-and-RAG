The study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting to monitor the model performance during training. This approach involved splitting the data into training and test sets 100 times, and for each split, the hyperparameters were tuned on the training set. The model was then trained using the optimal hyperparameter setting. This process allowed for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data (the test set) and helped to prevent overfitting. Additionally, various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and cross-validation R2 were used to assess the model's performance.
