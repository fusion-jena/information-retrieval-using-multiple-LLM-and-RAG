Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the FIREMAP workflow, the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE), and the BA algorithm for burn area mapping. It does mention the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
