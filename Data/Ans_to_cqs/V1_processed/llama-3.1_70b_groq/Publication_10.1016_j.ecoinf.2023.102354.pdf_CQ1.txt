The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that SMS data was obtained using GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) observations from 2002 to 2017. This suggests that the data may be collected from existing datasets or models, rather than through surveys or sensors.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of GRACE-derived TWS (Total Water Storage) data, which is likely obtained from satellite observations. The context also mentions the use of various climate indices and datasets, such as ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, and IOD, which are likely obtained from publicly available datasets.

Overall, it appears that the data collection methods used in this study rely on existing datasets and models, rather than primary data collection through surveys or sensors. However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
