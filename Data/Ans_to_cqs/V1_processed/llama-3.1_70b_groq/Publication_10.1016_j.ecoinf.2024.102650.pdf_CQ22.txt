The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the ERNIE model achieved significant results in previous studies and performed better than the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformer model proposed by Google AI. Additionally, it mentions that the ERNIE model earned first place for a mixed-language emotional analysis task at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020.

The context also mentions the use of perplexity (P(D)) as a metric, which is a measure of how well a model predicts a test set. The perplexity is calculated using the formula:

P(D) = exp(∑M d=1 logDp(wd) / ∑M d=1 Nd)

However, it is not clear if this metric is used to evaluate the performance of the ERNIE model specifically.

Overall, the provided context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query, and it is not possible to determine the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
