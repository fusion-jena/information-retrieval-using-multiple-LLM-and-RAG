I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. In fact, the context mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) models, which is a type of machine learning algorithm, but it does not mention deep learning or any specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
