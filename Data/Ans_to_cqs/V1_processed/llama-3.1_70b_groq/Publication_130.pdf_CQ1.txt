The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include:

1. PIT tags and RFID readers fitted to a nest: This technology can automatically record data, such as the identity of birds visiting the nest, but has limitations in capturing additional information like the type of food brought to the chicks or the purpose of the visit.

2. Camera traps connected to a Raspberry Pi: This setup can collect a large number of labelled pictures, which can be used to train deep learning models. The camera traps can be used to capture images of birds at different times of the day and in various lighting conditions, increasing the variation in the training dataset.

3. Manual observation and labelling: Although not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that manual observation and labelling of data are also used, as the context mentions the importance of having a large labelled dataset for training deep learning models.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. The focus is on collecting data through automated means, such as RFID technology and camera traps, which can provide a large amount of labelled data for training deep learning models.
