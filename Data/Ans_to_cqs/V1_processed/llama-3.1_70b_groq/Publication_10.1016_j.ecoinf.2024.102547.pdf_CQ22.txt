The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model on both the training and testing datasets. The RMSE and MAE values are provided in the context for different models, including FDA, GAM, and FGSAM. 

Additionally, the coefficient of determination (R2) is also used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model. The R2 values are provided in the context, indicating the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). 

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context, which are commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of classification models. The context suggests that the model is a regression model, and therefore, RMSE, MAE, and R2 are used as evaluation metrics.
