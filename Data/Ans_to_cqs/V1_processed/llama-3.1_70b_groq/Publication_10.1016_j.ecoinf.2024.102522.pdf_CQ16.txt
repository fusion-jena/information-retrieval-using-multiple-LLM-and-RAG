Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the results of model validation and the accuracy of the model in predicting "present" and "absent" sample points, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
