Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the challenges of handling large amounts of data, particularly in the field of ecology, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images.

However, it does mention the importance of making well-informed and intentional decisions about which methods to use based on study-specific conditions, which could imply the need for careful consideration of data preprocessing techniques to address potential biases.

Some of the mentioned techniques, such as "painstaking manual human review of images," could potentially help identify and address data biases, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
