The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline primarily deals with image data, specifically raster bands from satellite images. The text mentions the use of spectral channels from satellite images, such as the Landsat-8 stack of visible color range, which suggests that the pipeline is designed to process and analyze image data.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, while CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common data format used in machine learning, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically raster bands from satellite images.
