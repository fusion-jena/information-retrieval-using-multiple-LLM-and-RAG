Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of data structures for machine learning classification, the use of RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and the evaluation metrics used for assessing the model's performance. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
