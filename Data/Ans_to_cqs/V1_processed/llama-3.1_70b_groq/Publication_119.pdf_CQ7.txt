The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that "independent testing data, i.e., same for all models, is used for model evaluation" in section 2.7. Accuracy Assessment. This suggests that the data is split into at least two parts: training data and testing data. 

Additionally, the context mentions hyperparameter tuning and optimization, which often involves splitting the data into three parts: training data, validation data, and testing data. However, the specific criteria used to split the data (e.g., 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing) are not mentioned in the provided context.
