Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on human-wildlife conflicts, and the references provided are mostly related to ecological and conservation biology topics. There is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.

However, I can see that one of the references mentions an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
