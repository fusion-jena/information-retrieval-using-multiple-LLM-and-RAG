Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to image processing (Zhang et al., 2015) and the mention of PCA-SVM and KNN confusion matrices for zebrafish and rat behavior (Fig. 11-14), it can be inferred that the data formats used might include image data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of machine learning for predicting behavioral patterns and mapping animals' actual movement trajectories, which could potentially involve the use of CSV files for storing and processing data. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
