The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a Python application was designed to train the CNN based on a selected dataset, and that the cyber system is responsible for interacting with a final user (biologist) who is responsible for ordering the new trainings of the CNNs and new updates of the trained CNNs on the physical nodes or on their digital twins.

It also mentions that the communication between the cyber and the physical system was made using the TCP/IP protocol, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed or serialized.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
