Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the training of models using multitask learning and transfer learning, and the evaluation metrics used to assess their performance. 

However, it does mention the calculation of metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as the calculation of standard deviation (SD) for these metrics. This suggests that some form of metrics calculation is involved in the postprocessing steps. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of validation loss and bias to evaluate the model's performance, which may be part of the postprocessing steps. However, it does not provide information on the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include metrics calculation (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score), but it is unclear if saliency maps or confusion matrices are used.
