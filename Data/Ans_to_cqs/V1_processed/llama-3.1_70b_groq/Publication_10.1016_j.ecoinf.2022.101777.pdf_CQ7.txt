Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a study on image classification using Random Forest (RF) and does not mention deep learning models. It discusses the use of RF for classification, the parameters used to calculate the total number of training samples required, and the importance of acquiring large-scale training data. However, it does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
