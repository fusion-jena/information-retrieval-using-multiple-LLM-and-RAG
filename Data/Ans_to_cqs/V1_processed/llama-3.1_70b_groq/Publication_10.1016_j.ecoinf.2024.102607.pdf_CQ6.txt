Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using random forest and other machine learning techniques, rather than deep learning.

However, it does mention the use of a "vegetation index feature dataset" and the potential incorporation of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep neural networks (DNN) in future studies. But it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that would be involved in preparing the data for these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
