According to the provided context, two metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the object-tracking algorithm: precision and success plots. The precision plot evaluates the center location error of the tracking algorithm, with higher values indicating more accurate center location. The precision plot is calculated as the average Euclidean distance between the centroid locations of the tracked targets and the manually labeled ground truths. Additionally, the percentage of video frames with Euclidean distance values within a specified threshold is also calculated. There is no mention of accuracy, recall, or other metrics in the provided context.
