The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. This is mentioned in the provided context: "The hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based (Akiba et al., 2019) hyperparameter optimization procedure." This suggests that the authors used the Optuna framework, which is a next-generation hyperparameter optimization framework, as described in the reference by Akiba et al. (2019).
