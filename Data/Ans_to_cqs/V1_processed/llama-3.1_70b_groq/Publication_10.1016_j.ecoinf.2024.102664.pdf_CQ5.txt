Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the development and evaluation of deep learning models for algal bloom forecasting, specifically in the Zhoushan fishery in 2022. It discusses the architecture of the CNN and LSTM models, as well as their performance on algal bloom forecasts, but does not mention any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
