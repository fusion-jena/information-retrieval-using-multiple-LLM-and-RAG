The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the system used resnet 50 and resnet 101 as backbone structures and used anchor boxes of ratio 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. It also mentions that the width and height of images in this research is fixed, therefore [a,640,640,3] becomes the image shape here and [a,640,640,1] becomes the mask shape where a is the number of training images and true masked images.

Additionally, the context mentions that the system is most compatible with tensorflow version 1.14.0 and keras version 2.2.4 along with python 3.6. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

It does mention data-augmentation in reference [27] "Effect of data-augmentation on fine-tuned CNN model performance" but does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved in the specific model being discussed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
