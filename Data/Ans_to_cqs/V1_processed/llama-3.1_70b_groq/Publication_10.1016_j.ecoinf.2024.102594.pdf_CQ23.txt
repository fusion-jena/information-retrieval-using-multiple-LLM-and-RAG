To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was split into training and validation sets, with 70% of the dataset used for training and the remaining 30% for validation. This split helps to prevent overfitting and allows the model to be evaluated on unseen data.

Additionally, data augmentation techniques were applied to the training set to increase its diversity. These techniques included flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels while keeping the labels unchanged, randomly rotating the images and labels by 90 degrees, and randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged. These techniques help to increase the size of the training set and expose the model to different variations of the data, making it more robust and generalizable.

Furthermore, the model was trained on a diverse dataset, which included images from different sources (e.g., UAV and GF1) and with different spatial resolutions (e.g., 2m). This diversity helps to ensure that the model can generalize well to different types of data.

However, it is not clear from the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. Therefore, I do not know if these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
