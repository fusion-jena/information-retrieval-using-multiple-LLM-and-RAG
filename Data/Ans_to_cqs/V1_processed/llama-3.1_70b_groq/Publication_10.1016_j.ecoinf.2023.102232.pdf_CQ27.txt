I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of a high-performance computing centre for calculations, the use of Python 3.6.8 and the Ray package for parallel configuration, and the development of an algorithm for estimating model parameters using a combination of least squares methods and genetic algorithms. However, it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model.
