Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. The text discusses the use of various models, such as ViT-B/16, DenseNet-161, and ResNet-50, and mentions the adaptation of pretraining approaches like BERT for birdsong classification. However, it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of these models.

The context does mention the use of a consolidated overview of evaluation and performance metrics for machine learning and computer vision, but it does not provide specific details on the metrics used in this particular study.

Therefore, I do not know the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this context.
