Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model building process, including feature selection and training of different classification models (Random Forest, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, Na√Øve Bayes). It also discusses the performance of the models and forecast distribution, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention the validation of the trained models, and the results are shown in Table 5, which is not provided in the given context. It can be inferred that some form of evaluation or validation is performed, but the specifics are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
