The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It discusses data augmentation and few-shots learning algorithms as solutions to tackle the problem of lack of data, and presents some experimental results using a ResNet DL model. However, it does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used during training.
