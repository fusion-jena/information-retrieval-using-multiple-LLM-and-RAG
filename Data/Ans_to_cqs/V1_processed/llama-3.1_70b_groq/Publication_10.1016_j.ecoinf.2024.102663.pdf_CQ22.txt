The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Precision, Recall, and mAP (mean average precision). 

Precision provides information about the projected segment's accuracy. Recall measures the ability of a model to identify all relevant instances of a particular class. mAP (mean average precision) is the measure of choice for object detection algorithms, which is calculated by plotting a series of precision-recall curves with increasing difficulty levels in IoU and computing the area under the curve.

Additionally, other metrics such as accuracy, IoU (Intersection over Union), and R2 (coefficient of determination) are also used to evaluate the performance of different models. For example, the YOLOv4 model has an accuracy of 91.52%, while the mYOLOv8 model has a recall rate of 0.997 and an mAP of 0.899 (IoU 50-95%). 

Other metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Percentage Error (MPE) are used to evaluate the performance of regression models. For instance, the Partial Least Square model has an RMSE of 7.10 g and an MAE of 5.36 g.
