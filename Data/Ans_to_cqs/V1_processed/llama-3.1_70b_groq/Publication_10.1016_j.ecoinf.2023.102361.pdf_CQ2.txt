The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image classification, as mentioned in section 2.4. Performance metrics, where it is stated that "The performance of image classification models can be evaluated using several metrics...".

Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, and others, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the pipeline is likely images.

However, it is not possible to determine the specific image format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) or whether other data formats such as CSV are used in the pipeline.
