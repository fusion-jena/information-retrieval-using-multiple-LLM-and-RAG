The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it mentions the use of pre-trained CNN architectures such as Inception, Residual Neural Network (Resnet), and Dense Convolutional Network (Densenet). Additionally, the pipeline utilizes a Region Proposal Network (RPN) and a Faster R-CNN approach, which are also based on CNNs. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
