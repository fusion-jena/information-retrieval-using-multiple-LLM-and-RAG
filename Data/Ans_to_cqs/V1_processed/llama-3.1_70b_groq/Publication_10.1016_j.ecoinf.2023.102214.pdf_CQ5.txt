The provided context does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it mentions that the researchers have compiled the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research, which is contributed to Whiskerbook.org. This dataset is specifically used for training machine learning algorithms, such as PIE, and is used for individual ID and image classification tasks. The context also mentions that the dataset is curated and enhanced through a process of graph matching and manual observer verification, but it does not provide information on the use of other specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
