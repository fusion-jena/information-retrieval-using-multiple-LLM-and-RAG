Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including the mini-batch size, GPU memory limitations, and the use of MATLAB and the ResNet-50 pre-trained model. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
