Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and articles related to machine learning, remote sensing, and environmental science, but it does not provide information about the specific code repository of the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question. If you need to find the code repository, you may want to try searching online or contacting the authors of the papers directly.
