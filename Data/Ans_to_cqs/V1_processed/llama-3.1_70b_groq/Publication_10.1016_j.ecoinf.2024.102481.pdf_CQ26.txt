Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in fisheries biology, ecology, genetics, and climate change, with a focus on Random Forests and other ML algorithms.

However, it does mention the use of Random Forests for classification and regression tasks, which can be affected by data bias. But it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

That being said, the context does mention the use of different algorithms and techniques in various studies, such as Boosted Regression Trees, Convolutional Neural Networks, and morphometric measurements of sagittal otoliths. But it does not specifically discuss techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or would like to know more about the topics discussed in the context, I would be happy to try and help.
