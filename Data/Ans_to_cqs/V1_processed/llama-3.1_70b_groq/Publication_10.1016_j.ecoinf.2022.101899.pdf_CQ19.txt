Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context only mentions that Halgamuge et al. (2020) used deep learning technology to estimate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks employed. Similarly, the context does not mention the frameworks used by Dowdy (2020) or Coen et al. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
