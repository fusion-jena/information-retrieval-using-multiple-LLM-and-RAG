Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on audio processing and bioacoustics applications, discussing the use of deep learning methods for noise reduction and audio enhancement. It mentions the use of audio spectrograms and raw waveform data, but does not provide information on specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
