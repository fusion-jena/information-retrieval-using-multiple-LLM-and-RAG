I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to groundwater-climate interactions, drought, and hydrological studies, with references to various research papers and studies. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
