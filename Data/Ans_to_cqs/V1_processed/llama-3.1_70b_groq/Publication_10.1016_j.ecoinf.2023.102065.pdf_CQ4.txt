The data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is splitting the merged .wav training file for each species in half and then adding these two halves sample-wise. This augmented .wav file was then split into 2-s increments and mel-spectrograms were computed. This technique is used to regularize models and provide more robust features.

There is no mention of other data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the provided context. These techniques are commonly used in image classification tasks, but the context provided is focused on sound classification using mel-spectrograms.
