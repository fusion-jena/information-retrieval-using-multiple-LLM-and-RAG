Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically the YOLOv5 model family, for detecting alates on sorghum leaves, but it does not provide information on the regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
