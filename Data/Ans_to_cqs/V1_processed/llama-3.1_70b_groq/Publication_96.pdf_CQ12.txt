The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. According to the provided context, the DNN model is a learning algorithm based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers. It uses hierarchical data processing, where the input data in each module (called the hidden layer) results in an output that is an input for the next module, connected through weights and biases whose values were learned during the training of the network. However, it does not specify whether the DNN model is a specific type such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
