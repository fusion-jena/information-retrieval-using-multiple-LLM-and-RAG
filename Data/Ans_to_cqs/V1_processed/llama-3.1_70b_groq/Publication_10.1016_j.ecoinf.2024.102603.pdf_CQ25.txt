Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. The context discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. However, it does not specify the specific task or purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
