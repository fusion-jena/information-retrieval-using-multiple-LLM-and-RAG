Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the experimental setup, system requirements, model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related details. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
