Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. The context mentions various computer vision tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and image classification, which typically involve image data. Specifically, the context mentions the use of image sizes such as 512, 640, 768, etc., and the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale image classification dataset.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, while CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common data format, it is not explicitly mentioned in the context as being used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
