The provided context mentions the following datasets used in deep learning pipelines:

1. COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset: This dataset has 121,408 images and a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. It is a widely used dataset to train computer vision models and sets a baseline to benchmark their performance.

No other datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are mentioned in the provided context. However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of open image datasets, which have pushed the evolution of segmentation, but it does not specify which ones.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only dataset that can be confirmed as being used in the deep learning pipeline is the COCO dataset.
