I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings, the preprocessing of training data, and the challenges of applying deep learning in acoustic monitoring. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
