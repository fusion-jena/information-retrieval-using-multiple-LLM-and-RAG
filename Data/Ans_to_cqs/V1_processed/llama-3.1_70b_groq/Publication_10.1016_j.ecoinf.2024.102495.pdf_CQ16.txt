Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that the model was trained using epochs and batch sizes of 10 and 32, respectively, and that the model was evaluated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training.

The text does mention that the model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and area under the curve (AUC) score, but it does not specify how these metrics were used to determine when training was complete.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
