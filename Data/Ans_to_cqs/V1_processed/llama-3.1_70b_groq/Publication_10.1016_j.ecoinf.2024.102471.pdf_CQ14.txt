Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the architecture and training process of the wav2vec model, including the pre-training and fine-tuning phases, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
