The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses image data. 

The context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the AlexNet architecture, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of band reflectance of water quality monitoring, which suggests that the pipeline may be working with remote sensing or satellite imagery data. 

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. While CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are commonly used in machine learning pipelines for storing and processing tabular data, there is no explicit mention of CSV files being used in this specific pipeline. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses image data, but the exact data formats used are not explicitly stated.
