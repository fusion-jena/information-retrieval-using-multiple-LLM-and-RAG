Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and comparison of the CNN and XGB models, as well as the input variables used in the models.

However, it does mention that the training and prediction were done on a desktop with 64 Gb of RAM and one Titan X (Maxwell) GPU. This suggests that the deployment was likely done on a local machine or a similar setup, but the exact process is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the prediction time can be reduced by distributing the prediction to more cores or more machines, which implies that the model can be deployed in a distributed manner. However, the specific details of the deployment process, such as model serialization and platform selection, are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
