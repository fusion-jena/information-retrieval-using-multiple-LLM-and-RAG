The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context is ImageNet. Specifically, the U-Net model implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python is pretrained on ImageNet. This pretraining on ImageNet is mentioned as a factor that improves the classification accuracy of the model and reduces the requirement for a large dataset. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets being used in the pipeline.
