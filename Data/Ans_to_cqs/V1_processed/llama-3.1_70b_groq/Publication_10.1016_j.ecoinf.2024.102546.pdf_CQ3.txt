Based on the provided context, it appears that bounding box annotation is one of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the mention of "bounding box instances" and "bounding box annotations" in the context. For example, the CropAndWeed dataset has 5,764 bounding box instances, and the dataset by Sudars et al. (2020) has 7,853 bounding box annotations.

However, there is no explicit mention of instance segmentation as a data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline. While bounding box annotation is a common technique used in object detection tasks, instance segmentation is a more advanced technique that involves segmenting individual objects within an image. Without further information, it is unclear whether instance segmentation is used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that bounding box annotation is one of the data annotation techniques used, but it is unclear whether instance segmentation is used.
