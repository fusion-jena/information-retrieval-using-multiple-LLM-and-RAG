Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms for habitat suitability prediction and species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information on the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

However, it does mention the use of various performance metrics such as AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values to evaluate the performance of the models. It also mentions the use of ensemble modeling approaches and the evaluation of model mean performances.

But, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
