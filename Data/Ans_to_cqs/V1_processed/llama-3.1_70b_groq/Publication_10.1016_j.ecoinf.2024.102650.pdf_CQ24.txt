Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling in natural language processing, specifically in the context of analyzing tweets about contaminated sites. It discusses the LDA algorithm, its advantages, and its application in topic modeling, but does not touch on deep learning or randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
