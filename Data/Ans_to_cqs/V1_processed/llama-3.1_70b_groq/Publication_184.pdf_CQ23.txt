To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the following measures were taken:

1. **Data Augmentation**: The text mentions that data augmentation was used to extend the amount of data. This technique helps to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to the existing images. This can help the model generalize better to new, unseen data.

2. **Random Selection of Images**: For each epoch, 64 images were randomly selected and used to train the model. This random selection can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided text. It is also not clear if the dataset is diverse or if any other measures were taken to ensure generalizability.

It is worth noting that the model was trained on a limited number of samples, and each image was used multiple times due to this limitation. This could potentially affect the model's ability to generalize to new data.
