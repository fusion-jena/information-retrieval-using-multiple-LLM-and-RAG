Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning models for estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) and mentions various studies that have used different machine learning techniques, such as random forest, support vector regression, and k-nearest neighbor. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps used in these studies.

The only relevant information that can be inferred is that the studies used different datasets, such as ALS data, Landsat imagery, and LiDAR data, which may require different preprocessing steps. However, the specific preprocessing steps used in these studies are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
