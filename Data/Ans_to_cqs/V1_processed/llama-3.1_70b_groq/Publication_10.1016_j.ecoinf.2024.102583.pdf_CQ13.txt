Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions that the authors plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in the future, pending data availability. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in these models.
