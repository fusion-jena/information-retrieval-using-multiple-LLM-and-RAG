Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the model selection process, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation of various machine learning models, including deep learning models. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that were taken before training these models.

The context does mention that the dataset was divided into training and test sets, and that random sampling was used to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset. However, it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps that may have been taken to normalize, scale, or clean the data before training the models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question. If you have any further context or information, I would be happy to try and help.
