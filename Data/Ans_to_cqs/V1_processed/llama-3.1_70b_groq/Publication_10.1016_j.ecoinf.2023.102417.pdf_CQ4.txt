Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the importance of training data resembling the data the model will be applied to, the concept of data drift or domain drift, and the need for domain adaptation. It also discusses the Joint Energy-Based Semantic Segmentation (JESS) model and its methodological workflow, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
