Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context only mentions that Huang et al. (2019) used high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning to monitor ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
