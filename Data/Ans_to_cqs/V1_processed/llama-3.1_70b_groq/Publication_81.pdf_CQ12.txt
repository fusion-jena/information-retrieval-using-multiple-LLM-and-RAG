The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE). This model is a type of neural network that combines the benefits of Elastic Net regularization with the feature learning capabilities of a Stacked Autoencoder. The EN-SAE is used to learn deep features from the DNA barcode sequences and obtain an outgroup score for each fish.
