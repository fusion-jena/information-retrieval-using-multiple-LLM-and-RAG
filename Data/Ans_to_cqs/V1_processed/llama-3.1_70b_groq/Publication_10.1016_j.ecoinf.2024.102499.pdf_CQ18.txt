The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is k-fold cross-validation. The context mentions that "For each fold, the frames from Trainingclips were used to train the models." This indicates that the dataset was split into multiple folds, and the model was trained and evaluated on each fold separately. This approach allows for assessing the robustness of the method on short sequences centered around the presence of fish presence. Additionally, the Testingstations, common to all k-fold, were used to assess the robustness of the method on 1-h videos, corresponding to real use-case scenarios of ecological studies.
