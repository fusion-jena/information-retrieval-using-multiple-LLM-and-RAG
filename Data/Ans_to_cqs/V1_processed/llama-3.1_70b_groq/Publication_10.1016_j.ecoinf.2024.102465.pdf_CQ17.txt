Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of HRNet for semantic segmentation, NLP models for text data sentiment scoring, and other topics such as sustainable development goals and crowdsourcing. It does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of HRNet, which is a deep learning model that has been shown to be effective in various tasks. HRNet may have built-in regularization mechanisms or techniques to prevent overfitting, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
