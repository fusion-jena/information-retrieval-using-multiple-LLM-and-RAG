The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. The context mentions the use of the PlantVillage dataset, which is a dataset of images of plants. The experiments involve training and testing deep learning models on these images, with the goal of classifying them into different classes. The context also mentions the use of color, grayscale, and leaf-segmented images, but it does not mention the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats.
