I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its performance metrics. It discusses the analysis of urban acoustic environments using complex network measures, specifically the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL). The context also mentions the use of machine learning approaches for sound event classification, but it does not provide information on the performance metrics used to evaluate these models.
