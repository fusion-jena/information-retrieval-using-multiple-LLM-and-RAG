Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the dataset, annotation process, and training data for bat echolocation call detection using CNNs. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention the use of a test set (iBats Romania and Bulgaria) to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not elaborate on the evaluation metrics or postprocessing techniques used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
