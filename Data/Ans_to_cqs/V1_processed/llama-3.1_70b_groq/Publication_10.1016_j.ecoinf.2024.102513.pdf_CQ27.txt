Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, the architecture of the convolutional neural network, and the calculation of classification accuracy. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
