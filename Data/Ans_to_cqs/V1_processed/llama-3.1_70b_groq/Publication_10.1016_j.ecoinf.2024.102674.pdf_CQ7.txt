Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on the evaluation of different machine learning algorithms (RFs, GBMs, ANNs, and GAMs) for interpolating weather station data and downscaling climate data. It discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate the models, such as KGE, pbias, MAE, and RMSE, but does not provide information on the data splitting criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context.
