I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF), but does not provide information about the specific architecture of the ANN, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context only mentions that the trained ANN is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a hidden layer, but this is not a deep learning model in the same sense as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
