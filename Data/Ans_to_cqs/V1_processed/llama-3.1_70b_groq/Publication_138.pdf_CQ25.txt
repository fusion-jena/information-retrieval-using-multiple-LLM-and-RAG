The provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, based on the information given, it appears to be a classification model. The model has a Softmax activation function layer with 2 neurons, which is typically used for binary classification problems. Additionally, the model's architecture is compared to other classification models such as LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, which further suggests that the model is designed for classification tasks.
