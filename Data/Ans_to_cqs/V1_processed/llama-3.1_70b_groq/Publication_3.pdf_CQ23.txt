The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was calibrated using different numbers of training steps and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow: correct identification rate and processing time. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a dataset with 20 species for Challenge 1 and 41 species for Challenge 3, which suggests that the dataset may have been diverse in terms of the number of species. However, it does not provide information on whether the dataset was diverse in other aspects, such as geographic location, environmental conditions, or time of year.

The context also mentions that the model was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which suggests that some form of evaluation was performed to assess the model's performance. However, it does not provide information on whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Overall, while the context provides some information on the model's performance and calibration, it does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
