The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily video. According to the provided context, the researchers used 175 underwater high-definition videos, which lasted between 5 and 21 minutes, to train and test their CNN model and post-processing method. These videos were recorded in 1920 Ã— 1,080 pixels with GoPro Hero 3 + black and Hero 4 + black cameras. Additionally, the researchers extracted fish images from these videos, suggesting that image data is also used in the pipeline. However, there is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
