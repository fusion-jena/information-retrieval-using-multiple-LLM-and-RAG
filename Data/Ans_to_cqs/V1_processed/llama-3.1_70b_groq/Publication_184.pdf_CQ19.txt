The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the YOLO model, specifically YOLOv3, and its architecture, but it does not mention the framework used for implementation. Therefore, I do not know which framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is used to build the model.
