The text mentions that the authors resorted to purely deterministic variants of architectures, but it does not explicitly state the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors attempted to use a Transformer version for video prediction, similar to Liu et al. (2020), but encountered significant memory limitations. Additionally, it mentions the use of Convolutional LSTM networks in the context of precipitation nowcasting. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors experimented with both Transformer and Convolutional LSTM (a type of RNN) architectures, but the specific model used in the pipeline is not clearly stated.
