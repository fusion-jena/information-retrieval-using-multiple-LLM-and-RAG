Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on drought characteristics, drought indices, and the calculation of drought severity and duration. It does not provide information on machine learning model training or postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
