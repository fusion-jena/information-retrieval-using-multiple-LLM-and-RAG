I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It mentions the MI's metadata repository, known as the Data Catalogue, which is an online infrastructure that supports the storage of datasets, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Additionally, it mentions GitHub, but only in the context of open-data principles, not as a repository link for a deep learning pipeline.
