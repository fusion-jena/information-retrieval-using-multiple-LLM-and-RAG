Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the performance of different models (GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS), the importance of environmental variables in predicting habitat suitability, and the use of sensitivity analysis to address uncertainties in movement behavior and dispersal data. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
