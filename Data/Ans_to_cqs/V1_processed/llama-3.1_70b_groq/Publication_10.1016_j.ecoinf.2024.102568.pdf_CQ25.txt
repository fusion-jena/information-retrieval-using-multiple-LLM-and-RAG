The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, is to predict the concentration of pollutants in the air, based on the context provided. The model is trained on a dataset of measurements from air quality stations and is used to forecast future concentrations. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean relative error (MRE). The goal of the model is to provide accurate predictions of air quality, which can be used to inform decision-making and policy development.
