Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the model parameters were tuned on an independent dataset, collected with the identical instrumentation but at a different location, and that the obtained parameters were found to be sufficiently robust on the dataset used in this work without any fine-tuning.

However, it does mention that the model parameters were tuned, and the values of the hyperparameters [a, b, w1, w2, w3, w4] were found to be a = 0.2, b = 0.05, w1 = w2 = 1.2, w3 = 0.9, and w4 = 1.1. But it does not provide information on the optimization method used to obtain these values.

Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
