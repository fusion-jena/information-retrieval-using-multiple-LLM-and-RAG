Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that field measurements and manual classification of fuel types were limited to data collected at Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL), which were used for training and testing the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm. Additionally, data collected at Conklin (CK) were used solely for independent validation.

This suggests that the data was split into at least three sets: training, testing, and validation. The training and testing sets were likely derived from the data collected at PM and CL, while the validation set was derived from the data collected at CK. However, the exact criteria used to split the data, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set, is not specified in the provided context.
