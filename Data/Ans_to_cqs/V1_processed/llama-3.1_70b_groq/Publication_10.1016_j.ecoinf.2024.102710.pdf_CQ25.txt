The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically BirdNet, is classification. According to the text, BirdNet is a "deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" (Kahl et al., 2021) and is used for classifying bird species based on their sounds. The model is also used for feature embedding, where it is used to generate embeddings that can be used for classification tasks. Additionally, the text mentions that the model is used for active learning, where it is used to select the most informative samples for annotation to improve the model's performance. However, the primary purpose of the model is classification, specifically for avian species classification.
