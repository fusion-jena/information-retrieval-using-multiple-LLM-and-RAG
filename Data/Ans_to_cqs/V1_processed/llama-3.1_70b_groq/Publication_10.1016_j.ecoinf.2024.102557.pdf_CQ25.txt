Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific purpose of a deep learning model. However, based on the various applications of machine learning in ecology mentioned in the context, it can be inferred that deep learning models are likely used for tasks such as classification, detection, and possibly segmentation.

For instance, the context mentions the use of machine learning for species identification through imagery (Gao et al., 2024), which could involve classification or detection tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the characterization of land use change (Gelabert et al., 2021), which could involve segmentation tasks.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact purpose of a deep learning model. The context provides a general overview of the applications of machine learning in ecology, but it does not provide detailed information on the specific tasks or purposes of individual deep learning models.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the purpose of a deep learning model in this context is likely related to tasks such as classification, detection, or segmentation, but the exact purpose is not explicitly stated.
