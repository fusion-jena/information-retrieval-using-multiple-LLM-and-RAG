Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data augmentation method used to create effective variation in training data, the training process of the EfficientNet model, and the evaluation metrics used.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for training the EfficientNet model consists of images, as the context mentions preparing 4000 images for each category and using data augmentation methods to create variation in the training data. The source of these images is not specified, but it can be assumed that they might have been collected through various means such as public datasets, camera traps, or field observations.

The context also mentions a "test video" which suggests that video data might be used for evaluation purposes. However, the method of collecting this video data is not mentioned.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
