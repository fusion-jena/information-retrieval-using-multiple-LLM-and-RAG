The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Bias Error (MBE). Additionally, their normalized counterparts, MAE%, RMSE%, and MBE%, are also calculated by dividing the respective metrics by the corresponding mean values over the training data. These metrics measure the average deviation between model prediction and reference data, with RMSE giving a higher penalty to large deviations. The MBE serves to identify systematic biases in the predictions.
