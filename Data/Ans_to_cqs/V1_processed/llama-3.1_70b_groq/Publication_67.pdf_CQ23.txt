The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the use of a larger number of training samples, which can contribute to the model's generalizability. 

The context also mentions the use of different CNN-based models with varying training datasets, including continuous tree cover classes and a larger number of training samples. This suggests that the researchers may have explored different approaches to improve the model's performance and generalizability. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a diverse dataset, including images from Google, Maxar, and the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize to different scenarios. However, without more information, it is unclear whether the researchers used techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting to further ensure the model's generalizability.
