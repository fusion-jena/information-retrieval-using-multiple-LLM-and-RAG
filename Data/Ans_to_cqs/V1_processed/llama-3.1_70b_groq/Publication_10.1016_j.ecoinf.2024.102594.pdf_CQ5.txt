Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing image classification using the DeepLabV3+ algorithm, and it mentions the use of remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
