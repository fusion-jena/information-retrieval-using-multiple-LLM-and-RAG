Based on the provided context, it appears that the study utilizes airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and PlanetScope imagery as the primary sources of raw data. The ALS data is used to collect high-resolution topographic information, while the PlanetScope imagery provides spectral information related to vegetation and water content.

Specifically, the ALS data is collected using a system with the following parameters:

* Date of acquisition: 18.04.2020
* Altitude system: PL-EVRF2007-NH
* Number of points per m2: 25
* Mean height error: 0.2

The PlanetScope imagery is used to collect spectral information, which is then combined with the ALS data to predict volumetric water content (VWC) in post-mining landscapes.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used as sources of raw data in the provided context. Sensors are not explicitly mentioned either, but it can be inferred that the ALS system and PlanetScope imagery are types of sensors used to collect the raw data.
