Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text only discusses the performance evaluation of different deep learning algorithms for bird object detection and the conclusion that deep learning-based approaches have the potential to detect wild birds in camera traps efficiently. It does not provide information on model deployment, model serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
