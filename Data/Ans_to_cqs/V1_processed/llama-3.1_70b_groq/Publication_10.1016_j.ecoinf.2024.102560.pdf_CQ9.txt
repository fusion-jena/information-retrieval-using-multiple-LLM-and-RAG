I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of satellite-based datasets, such as MODIS and CMAP, for drought monitoring, and mentions that the CMAP data can be downloaded from the NOAA repository. However, it does not provide information about a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.
