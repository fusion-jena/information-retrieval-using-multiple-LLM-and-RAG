The provided context mentions several methods utilized for collecting raw data, which can be potentially used in a deep learning pipeline. These methods include:

1. Field surveys: The context mentions a field survey design (Section 2.3) and field investigation (Fig. 1d), indicating that on-ground surveys are used to collect data.
2. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology: The context mentions the use of LiDAR for deriving tree canopy height heterogeneity (Torresani et al., 2023) and for creating digital terrain models (DTM) and flood risk mapping (assessment of deep learning based classification of LiDAR and UAV points clouds).
3. UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) data: The context mentions the use of UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data for individual tree segmentation and tree species classification (Qin et al., 2022).
4. Remotely sensed imagery: The context mentions the use of remotely sensed imagery for estimating crown biomass of Pinus pinaster stands and shrubland above-ground biomass (Viana et al., 2012).
5. Forest inventory data: The context mentions the use of forest inventory data for estimating crown biomass of Pinus pinaster stands and shrubland above-ground biomass (Viana et al., 2012).

It is likely that these data collection methods are used to gather raw data for a deep learning pipeline, but the context does not explicitly state this.
