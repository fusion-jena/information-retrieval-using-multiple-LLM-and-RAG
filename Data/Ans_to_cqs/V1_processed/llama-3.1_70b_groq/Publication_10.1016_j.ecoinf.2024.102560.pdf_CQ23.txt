Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The text only mentions the use of CMAP precipitation datasets and Landsat satellite datasets for investigating water surface area and salinity variations, as well as land cover variations. It also mentions radiometric calibration to minimize radiometric effects, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
