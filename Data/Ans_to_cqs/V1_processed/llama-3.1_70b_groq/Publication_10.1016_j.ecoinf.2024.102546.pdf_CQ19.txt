Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context mentions various papers and research studies related to deep learning, computer vision, and robotics, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of "model architectures" and "training efficiency," which suggests that the researchers may have used popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. But without explicit mention, it is impossible to confirm which frameworks were used.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
