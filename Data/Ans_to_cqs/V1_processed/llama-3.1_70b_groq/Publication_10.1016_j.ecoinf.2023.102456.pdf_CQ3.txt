Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on a survey on missing data in machine learning, forest fires, and a research paper on an intelligent cellular scheme using machine learning. 

However, it does mention the use of spatial inputs, such as data extracted from a figure related to the states of each cell, with dimensions 257 × 257 × 9, denoted as M (masks of states). This suggests that some form of data annotation or preprocessing is being used, but the specific techniques are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
