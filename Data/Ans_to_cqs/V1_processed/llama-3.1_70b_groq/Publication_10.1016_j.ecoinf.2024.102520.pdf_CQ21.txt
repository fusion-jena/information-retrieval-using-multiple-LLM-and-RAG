Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article, focusing on image acquisition and processing, data curation, and validation. It includes a list of contributions from authors, some data points, and a mention of kriging variance and RMSE of residuals. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
