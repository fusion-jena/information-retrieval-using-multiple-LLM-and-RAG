The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F-score. Precision is the proportion of recognizer hits that are true detections of the target species, calculated as tp/(tp + fp). Recall is the proportion of target species vocalizations detected as hits by a recognizer, calculated as tp/(tp + fn). The F-score is a combination of precision and recall, calculated as ((β^2 + 1) * precision * recall)/(β^2 * precision + recall), where β is a user-defined metric that allows prioritization of one of the two. In this case, β = 1, so precision and recall are evenly balanced in importance.
