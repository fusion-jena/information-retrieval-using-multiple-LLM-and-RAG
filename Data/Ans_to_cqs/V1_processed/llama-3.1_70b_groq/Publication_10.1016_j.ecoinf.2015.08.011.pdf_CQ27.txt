Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and training of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, including the selection of the number of layers, neurons, learning rates, and epochs. It also discusses the use of a trial-and-error method to determine the optimal number of neurons and learning rate, as well as the application of early stopping to prevent overfitting.

However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
