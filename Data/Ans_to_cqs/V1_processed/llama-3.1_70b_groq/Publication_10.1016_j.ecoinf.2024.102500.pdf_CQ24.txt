The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. However, it does mention the use of randomness in the context of machine learning algorithms, particularly in the Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT) algorithm and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm.

In the context of ERT, the paper mentions that "bootstrapping for tree construction enhances diversity and randomness." This suggests that randomness is intentionally introduced into the tree construction process to improve the diversity of the trees.

In the context of RF, the paper mentions that the "bootstrap parameter in ensemble methods like BG, RF, and ET is crucial." This suggests that bootstrapping is used to introduce randomness into the RF algorithm.

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the "randint" command in Python to pick integers within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. This suggests that randomness is used to select hyperparameter values.

However, the paper does not discuss the use of random seed values or strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
