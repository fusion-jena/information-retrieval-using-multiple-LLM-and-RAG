Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques used to artificially increase the size of the dataset, such as Random crop, Mosaic, Color distortions, and others. These techniques are used to reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.

However, it does not provide information on techniques specifically used to address data bias, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this query.

If you're looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I can provide more details on the techniques mentioned in the context. However, for techniques specifically addressing data bias, I would recommend consulting additional resources or literature on deep learning pipelines.
