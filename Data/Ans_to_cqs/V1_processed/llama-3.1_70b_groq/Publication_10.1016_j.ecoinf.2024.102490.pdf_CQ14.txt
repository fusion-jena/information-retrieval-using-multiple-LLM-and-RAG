Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a list of references related to ecological niche modeling, species distribution modeling, and biodiversity conservation, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization methods used for hyperparameter tuning.

Some of the references mention the use of algorithms and models, such as predictive distribution models and ensemble models, but they do not provide details on the hyperparameter optimization methods used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
