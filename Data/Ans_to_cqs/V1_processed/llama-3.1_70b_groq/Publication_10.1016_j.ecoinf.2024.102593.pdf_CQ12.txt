Based on the provided context, it appears that the pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically a ResNet152 model, which is a type of CNN. This is mentioned in the text: "The ResNet152-architecture is based on the ResNet152 model (He et al., 2015) developed for image classification, but we did not use pre-trained weights." Additionally, the text mentions the use of a dense layer and mel spectrograms as input, which is consistent with a CNN architecture. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
