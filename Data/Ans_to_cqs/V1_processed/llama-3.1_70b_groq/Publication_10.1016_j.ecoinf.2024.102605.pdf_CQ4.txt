Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
