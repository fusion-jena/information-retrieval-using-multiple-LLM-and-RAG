The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the validation set is utilized during training to "fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring generalization." This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning is performed, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
