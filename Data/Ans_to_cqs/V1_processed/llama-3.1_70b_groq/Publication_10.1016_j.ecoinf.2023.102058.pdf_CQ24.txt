Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, and it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a grid search to find the best number of trees (ntrees) for a machine learning model, which is a hyperparameter tuning technique. But it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
