The provided context does not specifically mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of ensemble models and the optimization of hyperparameters using the Optuna algorithm. Additionally, it mentions that 80% of the data was used for training ensemble models, while the other 20% was used to validate each model to obtain individual optimized model hyperparameters.

It also mentions the use of randomized subsets of training data to estimate the effect of measurement uncertainties on chlorophyll-a predictions, which could be related to ensuring generalizability. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or a diverse dataset.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as using a separate validation set and optimizing hyperparameters.
