Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions the use of the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model for automated bird species monitoring by their vocalizations, but it does not provide details on the data augmentation techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
