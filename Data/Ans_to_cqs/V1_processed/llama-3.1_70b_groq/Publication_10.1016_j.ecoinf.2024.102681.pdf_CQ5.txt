The provided context does not mention the use of specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it mentions that the study compiled a comprehensive dataset to delve deeper into the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propagation. This dataset encompasses various influencing factors alongside an extensive drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020. The dataset was then divided into forty-two distinct datasets using a sliding window method with a window size of 30 years and a step size of one year. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not mention the use of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets in the deep learning pipeline. The study appears to be using a custom dataset related to drought propagation.
