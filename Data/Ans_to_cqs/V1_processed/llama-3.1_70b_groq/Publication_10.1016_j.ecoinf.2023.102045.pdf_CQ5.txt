I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, color blindness, and mapping, but it does not provide any information about deep learning or specific datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful answer to this query.
