The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of accuracy metrics on separate testing data, or withheld known classes. This testing data consists of 25% of the samples, which is a randomly sampled split that is standard modeling practice. The performance metrics used include the true positive rate or sensitivity, which measures the number of predicted observations that were accurately assigned to a class, and the true negative rate or specificity, which measures the number of predicted observations where the response variable of interest did not occur. This approach allows for the evaluation of the model's performance and the identification of the most accurate final model configuration.
