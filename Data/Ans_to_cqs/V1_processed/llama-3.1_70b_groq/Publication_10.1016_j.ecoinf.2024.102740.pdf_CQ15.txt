I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on random forest techniques, machine learning, and remote sensing applications, particularly in the context of grassland management and conservation. The papers and references cited are related to these topics, but do not mention deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
