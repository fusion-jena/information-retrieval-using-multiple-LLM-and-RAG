Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the integration of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. It also discusses the selection of distance metrics, hyperparameter tuning, and the evaluation of model performance.

However, it does mention that the selection of the distance metric was predicated on the data's characteristics and specific analytical prerequisites. But it does not provide any information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know what specific data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
