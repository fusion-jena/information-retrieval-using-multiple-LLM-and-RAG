The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that "temporally-precise and fine-grained annotation of audio demands expertise, and is thus costly and time-consuming." This suggests that the annotation process is challenging and requires specialized knowledge.

Additionally, the context mentions that the template-matching method uses ranges directly inherited from the 5 annotated events, but it does not provide further details on the annotation techniques used. It also mentions that some systems use explicit methods to control the duration of the detected events, such as post-processing predictions to delete/merge very short events, or estimating the typical duration from the examples.

Overall, the context does not provide a clear answer to the query, and it seems that the annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned.
