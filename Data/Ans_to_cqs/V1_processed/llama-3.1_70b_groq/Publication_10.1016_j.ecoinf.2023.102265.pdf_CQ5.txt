The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the ImageNet database. According to the text, "The image features are extracted from the fully connected layers pre-trained with the ImageNet database (https://image-net.org/index.php)". This suggests that the ImageNet database was used to pre-train the ResNet-50 model, which was then used for feature extraction in the pipeline. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets being used in the pipeline.
