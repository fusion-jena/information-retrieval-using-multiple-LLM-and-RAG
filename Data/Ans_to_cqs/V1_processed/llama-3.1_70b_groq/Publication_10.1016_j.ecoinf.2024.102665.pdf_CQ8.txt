I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of academic papers and publications related to coral reefs, marine biology, and ecology. There is no mention of a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
