The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of robust statistical measures and a rigorous validation methodology. Specifically, the performance of each machine learning model (MLM) was assessed using several metrics, such as Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistics (TSS), Kappa, and phi. Additionally, the models were evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design, where 70% of the data was used to train the model and 30% was reserved as a validation set. This process was repeated 10 times, resulting in 50 models, consisting of 10 models for each machine learning algorithm. This approach allowed for the evaluation of the models' predictive capabilities and the identification of any potential overfitting or underfitting.
