The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data-augmentation techniques used to artificially increase the number of samples in the training set. These techniques include rotation, flipping, translation, cropping, or changing the brightness of the pixels. 

While data-augmentation can help increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, it may not directly address data bias. However, it can help reduce the impact of bias by providing a more diverse set of examples for the model to learn from.

The context does not mention Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning to address class imbalance and data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that data-augmentation techniques are used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, but it does not provide information on techniques specifically used to address data bias.
