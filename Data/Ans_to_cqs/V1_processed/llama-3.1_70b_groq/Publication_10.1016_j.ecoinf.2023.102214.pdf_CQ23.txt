Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It mentions that the model was trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs and inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting, but it does not provide information on techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset.

However, it does mention that the dataset used is the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research, which suggests that the dataset may be diverse and representative of the population. Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance was evaluated using top-k accuracy on a test set, which implies that the model was tested on unseen data. Nevertheless, without further information, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
