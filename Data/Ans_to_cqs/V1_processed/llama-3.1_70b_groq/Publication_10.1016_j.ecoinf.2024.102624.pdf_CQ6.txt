Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on classification and regression training, accuracy assessment, and remote sensing applications, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it does mention some general strategies for improving classification accuracy, such as training data augmentation, post-classification, segmentation, and filtering, which may be relevant to preprocessing steps. Additionally, it mentions the importance of refining the training samples and changing the proportion of the training and test data.

But, specifically, it does not mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.

If you're looking for general information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I can tell you that common steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, handling missing values, and data augmentation, but this information is not present in the provided context.
