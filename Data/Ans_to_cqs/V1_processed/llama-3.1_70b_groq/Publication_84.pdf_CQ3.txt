Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE), for remote sensing image classification, specifically for detecting invasive species like Spartina alterniflora. It discusses the comparison of SAE with traditional machine learning methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the potential benefits of incorporating phenological knowledge into deep learning methods. However, it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
