Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, the application of deep learning for detecting artisanal small-scale mining, and the processing of satellite images. However, it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context does mention the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud processing platform for accessing, selecting, and processing satellite images. It also mentions the use of Landsat images and the processing of images in seconds to minutes. However, it does not provide information on how the trained deep learning model was deployed.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including model serialization and platform selection.
