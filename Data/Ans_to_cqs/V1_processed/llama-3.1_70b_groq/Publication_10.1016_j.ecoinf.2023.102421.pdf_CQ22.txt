The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2). These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in estimating Above-Ground Biomass (AGB). Specifically, the RMSE is used as the objective function (loss function) to optimize the hyperparameters of the models.
