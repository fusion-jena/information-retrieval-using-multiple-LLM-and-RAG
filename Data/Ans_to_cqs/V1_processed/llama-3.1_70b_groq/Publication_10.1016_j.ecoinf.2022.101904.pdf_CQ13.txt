I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the architecture of the models, including the Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer (ST), CoAtNet, and 3DUNetGSFormer, and provides results of their performance on a wetland mapping task. It also mentions the hardware configuration used for the experiments, but does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for training the models.
