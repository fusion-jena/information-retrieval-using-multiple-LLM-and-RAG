Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses Random Forest (RF) algorithms, their advantages, and their application in species distribution modeling. It also mentions Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) but does not delve into deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
