Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the use of random forest models in ecology, specifically for predicting mushroom productivity, and the training of species-specific models using the R package "ranger". It also mentions the tuning of model hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of confusion matrices, or generation of saliency maps.
