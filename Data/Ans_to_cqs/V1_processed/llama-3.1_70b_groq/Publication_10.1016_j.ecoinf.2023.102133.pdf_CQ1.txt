The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include:

1. Weather stations: The context mentions the use of weather stations to record weather data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.
2. EC towers: The context mentions the use of EC towers to acquire micro-meteorological data, such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity, at sub-hourly time-steps.
3. Sensors: The context mentions the use of low-cost sensors to collect data, although the specific type of sensors is not specified.
4. Public datasets: The context mentions the use of public datasets, such as the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a CR3000 datalogger to store high and low-frequency data collected by the EC tower.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of surveys as a method for collecting raw data.
