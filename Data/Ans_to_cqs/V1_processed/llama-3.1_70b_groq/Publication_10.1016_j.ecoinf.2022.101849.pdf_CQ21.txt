Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to focus on the concept of weakly supervised learning, different types of weak labels, and the performance of predictive models. It discusses the importance of using incompletely labeled data in model training and compares the performance of different approaches.

However, it does mention the calculation of performance metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the evaluation of prediction accuracy. It also mentions the use of tables (Tables 2-4) to summarize the performance of compared predictive models, but it does not provide details on the specific postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
