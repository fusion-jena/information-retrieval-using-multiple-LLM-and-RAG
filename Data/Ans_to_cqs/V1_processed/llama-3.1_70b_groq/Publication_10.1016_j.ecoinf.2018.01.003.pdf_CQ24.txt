Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be a collection of references and citations related to ecological informatics, machine learning, and deep learning, but it does not provide specific information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as random weight initialization, dropout, and data augmentation. To handle randomness, researchers and practitioners often employ strategies such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like batch normalization and regularization to reduce the impact of randomness
* Averaging the results of multiple models trained with different random seeds
* Using ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds

However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, and I couldn't find any specific information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines within the given references.
