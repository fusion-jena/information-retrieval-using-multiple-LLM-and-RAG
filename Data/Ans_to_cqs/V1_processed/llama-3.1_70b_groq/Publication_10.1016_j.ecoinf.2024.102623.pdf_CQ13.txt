The deep learning model uses the following hyperparameters:

* Learning rate: 0.0001
* Optimizer: AdamW
* Batch size: 256
* Number of epochs: 30
* Weight decay: 0.0001
* Learning rate scheduler: exponential decay with a rate of 0.95
* Dropout is also used, but the specific dropout rate is not mentioned.

Additionally, the model uses a multi-label classification setup with a sigmoid activation function in the final layer. The model architecture consists of four layers, each with 512 neurons, and residual connections are used between layers. Batch normalization and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function are used in all layers except the final one.
