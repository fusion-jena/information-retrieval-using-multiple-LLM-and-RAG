Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references related to movement ecology, machine learning, and statistical modeling, but it does not provide information on the development or evaluation of a specific deep learning model.

However, some of the references mention techniques that could be used to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation (e.g., Ladds et al., 2017) and the use of diverse datasets (e.g., Patterson et al., 2009). Additionally, some references discuss the importance of evaluating model performance using techniques such as hidden Markov models (Patterson et al., 2009) and state-space models (Thomson et al., 2013).

Overall, while the context provides some general information on machine learning and statistical modeling, it does not provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
