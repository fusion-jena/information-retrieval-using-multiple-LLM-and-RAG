The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on the optimization of model parameters for various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost.

However, it does mention the optimization of the "C" parameter in SVR, which balances margin width and misclassification tolerance. Additionally, it mentions the use of grid search to find optimal values for parameters such as "ntree" and "mtry" in RF, and "nrounds", "max depth", "min child weight", "gamma", and "subsample" in XGBoost.

But it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. If you're looking for information on deep learning optimization techniques, I would recommend looking into other sources that specifically focus on deep learning.
