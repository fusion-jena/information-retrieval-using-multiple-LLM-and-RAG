The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM)" and "Regularized Autoencoder" in passing, but it does not provide further details on the specific regularization methods used.

It can be inferred that the context is discussing the use of regularization in the context of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Deep Learning algorithms, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only mention that RELM is mentioned as a method that uses regularization, but I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
