The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention "hard negative mining" which is a technique used during the training process to selectively mine challenging negative examples. This technique can help the model learn to better distinguish between objects and background regions, leading to improved overall performance.

Additionally, the context mentions "precision and recall trade-offs" which suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated based on its precision and recall metrics. This implies that the model's performance is being monitored and evaluated during training, but the specific strategy used to do so is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, while we can infer that the model's performance is being monitored and evaluated during training, the exact strategy used to do so is not clear from the provided context.
