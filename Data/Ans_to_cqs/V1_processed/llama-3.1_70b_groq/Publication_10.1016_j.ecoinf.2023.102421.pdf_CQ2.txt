The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is tabulated format, specifically CSV (Comma Separated Values). According to the text, "The training dataset, including 268 sample plots with 39 features in a tabulated format, was used as input during the training process..." This suggests that the data is in a structured format, with rows and columns, which is typical of CSV files. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the pipeline.
