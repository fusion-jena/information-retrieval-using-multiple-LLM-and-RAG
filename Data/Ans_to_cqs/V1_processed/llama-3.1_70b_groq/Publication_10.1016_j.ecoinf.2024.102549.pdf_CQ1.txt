Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the authors are working with remote sensing data, possibly from satellite or aerial imagery, as they mention the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and feature extraction.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of water quality monitoring data, which may be collected through sensors or other monitoring systems. However, the specific methods used for collecting this data are not specified.

Therefore, while we can infer that remote sensing data and possibly sensor data may be used in the deep learning pipeline, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
