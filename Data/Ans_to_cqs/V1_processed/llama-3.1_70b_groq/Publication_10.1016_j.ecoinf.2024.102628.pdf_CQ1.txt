The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a ground-based profiling canopy LiDAR (PCL) multi-temporal dataset sourced from a small yet representative region in the central Amazon. This suggests that LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology is used to collect data on the forest structure and terrain variation.

Additionally, the context mentions that LiDAR surveys were conducted at high, medium, and low points along the topographic gradient, which implies that the data collection process involved some form of field survey or measurement. However, it does not provide further details on the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that LiDAR technology is used to collect data, but the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified.
