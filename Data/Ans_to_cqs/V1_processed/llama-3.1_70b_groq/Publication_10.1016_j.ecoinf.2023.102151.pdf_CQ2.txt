Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on soil mapping, visualization, and machine learning techniques, but it does not delve into the specifics of data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data formats used might include spatial data, such as soil texture and moisture data, which could be in formats like CSV, GeoTIFF, or other geospatial data formats. Additionally, the context mentions the use of remote sensing data, which could include image data formats like TIFF, JPEG, or other raster formats.

But without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query. The context does not mention audio or video data formats, so it is unlikely that these formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
