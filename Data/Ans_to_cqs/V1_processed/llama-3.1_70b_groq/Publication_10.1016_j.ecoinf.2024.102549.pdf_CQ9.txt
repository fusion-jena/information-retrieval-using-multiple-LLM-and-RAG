Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or a study that leverages remote sensing data and CNNs to study algal blooms in Lake Dianchi, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question. The context does not provide enough information to determine where the data repository is available, and I do not want to make an incorrect assumption.
