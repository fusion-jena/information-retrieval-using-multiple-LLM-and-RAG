Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on the use of satellite images, machine learning techniques, and geospatial computations for land use and land cover analysis, as well as forest fire area estimation. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
