The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the learning algorithm used is usually stochastic gradient descent, which is a common optimization algorithm used in deep learning.

In general, stochastic gradient descent is often used in conjunction with other techniques to determine when training is complete, such as early stopping or validation loss plateau. However, the specific implementation details are not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I do not know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete in this specific case.
