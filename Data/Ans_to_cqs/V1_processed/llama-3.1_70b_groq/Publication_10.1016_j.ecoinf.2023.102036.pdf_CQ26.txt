Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the application of deep learning in computer vision, particularly in the field of fisheries, and mentions the use of existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals to overcome limitations in dataset size. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

That being said, the context does mention the concept of "K labelled images in each category", which suggests that the dataset may be imbalanced, and techniques such as oversampling or undersampling might be relevant. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer, and it would be necessary to consult additional sources to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
