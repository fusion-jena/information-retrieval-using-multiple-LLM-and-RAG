The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe a data augmentation procedure that introduces randomness in the training process. The three-step data augmentation procedure involves:

1. Randomly flipping the image horizontally.
2. Scaling the contrast of each image channel by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2.
3. Randomly cropping the image to a square with side lengths equal to the image height.

These random augmentations are applied to the images during training, which helps to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting. However, the context does not provide information on how the randomness is controlled or whether a random seed value is used to ensure reproducibility.

Additionally, the context mentions that the training set is split into a validation set and a test set, but it does not provide information on how the splitting is done. It only mentions that the naive approach of randomly sampling images from the full data set may not be suitable due to the potential for information leakage between the data sets.

In summary, while the context describes some random processes in the data augmentation procedure, it does not provide information on strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of a random seed value.
