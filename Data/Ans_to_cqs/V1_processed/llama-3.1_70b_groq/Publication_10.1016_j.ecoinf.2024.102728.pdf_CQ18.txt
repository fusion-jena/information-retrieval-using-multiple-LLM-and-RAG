I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of academic references and a mathematical description of a classification methodology, specifically the NHC methodology. However, there is no mention of a model or its training process, let alone a strategy for monitoring its performance during training. The context seems to be focused on ecological and botanical studies, and the mathematical equations appear to be related to classification and sorting of data. Therefore, I couldn't find any relevant information to answer the query.
