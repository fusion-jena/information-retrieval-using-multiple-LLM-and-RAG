Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) and various machine learning models used for this purpose, such as weights-of-evidence, frequency ratio, weighted overlay, analytical hierarchy process, and evidential belief function. It also mentions the use of remote sensing and geospatial analysis technologies, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

However, it can be inferred that remote sensing and geospatial analysis technologies might be used to collect data, as they are mentioned as being used in LSM. Additionally, the context mentions the use of various data types, such as soil, land cover, lithology, and distance to streams and roads, which might be collected through surveys, sensors, or public datasets. But without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
