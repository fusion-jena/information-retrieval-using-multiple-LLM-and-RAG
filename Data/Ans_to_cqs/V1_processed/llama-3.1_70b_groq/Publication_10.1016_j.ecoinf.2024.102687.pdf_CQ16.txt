The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that fine-tuning was performed for 100 epochs, with one epoch corresponding to 500 episodic tasks. This suggests that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being based on a specific stopping criterion such as a validation loss plateau.
