Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the network, including the SRC3 block, CBS block, SPPF block, and CRFPN, as well as the feature extraction and fusion processes. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the network. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
