Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses various aspects of the system, including the use of YOLOv4 for animal detection, the evaluation of different pipeline configurations, and the power consumption of the system. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

The context does mention that further research is needed to identify and automate a process that, given a set of species of interest, outputs a robust and reliable neural network model with suitable weights (Section 7.1.3). This suggests that the hyperparameter optimization process may be an area of ongoing or future research, but the current context does not provide any details on how it is done.
