The purpose of the deep learning model is object classification, specifically for identifying species of plants from images. The model is designed to analyze images and identify the most frequent and common species of plants within them. The use of Region of Interest (ROI) pooling in the Faster R-CNN model suggests that the model is also capable of localizing specific regions within the images for accurate object classification. The model is trained on a large and complex image dataset, such as the one provided by the PlantCLEF challenges, to improve its performance in identifying plant species from images.
