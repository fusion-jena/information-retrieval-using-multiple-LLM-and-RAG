The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of random erasing as a data augmentation technique to improve the performance of the EfficientNet model.

Random erasing is a technique where a random portion of the input image is erased or masked during training. This helps the model to learn more robust features and reduces overfitting. The context mentions that random erasing was applied to the training dataset of the EfficientNet, and it moderately improved the performance of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Adagrad as the optimizer for training the EfficientNet model. Adagrad is an adaptive learning rate optimizer that can help to reduce the impact of randomness in the training process by adjusting the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient.

Overall, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it does describe the use of random erasing as a data augmentation technique and Adagrad as an optimizer, which can help to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
