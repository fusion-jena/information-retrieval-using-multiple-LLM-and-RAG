Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the design of a deep-learning architecture for toxicovigilance, performance metrics, and hyperparameters used for training a Recurrent Neural Network model. It also discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning in agriculture, entomology, and honey bee research. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in this deep learning pipeline.
