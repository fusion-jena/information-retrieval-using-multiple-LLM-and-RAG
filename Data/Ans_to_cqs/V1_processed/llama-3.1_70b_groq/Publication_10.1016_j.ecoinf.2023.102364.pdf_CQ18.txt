Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be focused on data compilation, processing, and model diagnostics, but it does not provide information on the specific approach used to monitor model performance during training.

However, it can be inferred that the model training data (Fig. 2) and external model assessment data (Fig. 3) might be used to evaluate the model's performance, but the exact strategy or metrics used to monitor performance during training are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
