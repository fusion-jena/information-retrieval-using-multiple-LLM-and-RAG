Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and references to various tools and technologies, but it does not include a direct link to a code repository.

However, some of the references mention specific deep learning frameworks and tools, such as Theano, Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow, and deeplearning4j, which are mentioned in the paper by Kovalev et al. (2016). Additionally, the context mentions AWS Kinesis and Apache Kibana, which are event-stream processing tools that could be used in a deep learning pipeline.

If you are looking for a specific code repository, I would recommend searching online for open-source deep learning pipelines that use the mentioned frameworks and tools. Some popular code repositories for deep learning pipelines include GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket, but without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a direct link.

In summary, I don't know the specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline, but I can suggest some possible resources and tools that may be helpful in finding one.
