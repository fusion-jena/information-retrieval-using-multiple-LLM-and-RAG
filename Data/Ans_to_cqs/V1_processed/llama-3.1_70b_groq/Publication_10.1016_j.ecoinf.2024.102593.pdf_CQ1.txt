According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) involve setting digital recorders in the field, which are serviced at regular intervals to retrieve sound data (i.e., bioacoustic recordings). This method allows for the collection of large amounts of data, which can then be processed using deep neural networks (DNN) to detect the presence of sound-producing animals.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the scarcity of labelled data is a challenge in this field, and active learning is used to progressively increase the training data by selecting the most informative samples from predictions made by a model on unlabelled data.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a specific dataset called NIPS4Bplus, which is a detailed-labelled dataset used for training DNN models. However, it is not clear if this dataset is publicly available or if it was specifically collected for the purpose of the research.
