Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Landsat 8 imagery and Google Cloud computing. It discusses the study region, methodology, and results, but does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

However, it does mention that the authors used geometrically corrected and preprocessed Landsat data available on the Google Earth Engine Platform, which suggests that some form of preprocessing was performed. Nevertheless, the specific techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context.
