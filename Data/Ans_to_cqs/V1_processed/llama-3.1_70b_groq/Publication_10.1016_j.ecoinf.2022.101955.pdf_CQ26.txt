The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the predictor variables were "equally centered and scaled" to reduce sampling bias. This suggests that some form of normalization or standardization was used to preprocess the data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the algorithms can be trained using both balanced datasets and imbalanced datasets without major classification uncertainties. This implies that the algorithms may be robust to some forms of data bias, but it does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, I do not know if these specific techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
