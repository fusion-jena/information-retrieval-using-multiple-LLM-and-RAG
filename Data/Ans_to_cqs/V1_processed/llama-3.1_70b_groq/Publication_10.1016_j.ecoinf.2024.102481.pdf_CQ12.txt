None of the mentioned deep learning models (CNN, RNN, Transformer) are used in the pipeline. The study actually uses a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which is a type of machine learning model, but not a deep learning model. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is used in this study to classify the maturity of Chilean hake based on histological staging.
