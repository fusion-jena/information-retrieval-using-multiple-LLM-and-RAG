The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images. The context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting image features, and the application of deep learning techniques to herbarium sheets and plant photos. This suggests that the primary data format is likely to be image data. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of datasets such as ImageNet, which is a large-scale hierarchical image database. This further supports the idea that image data is the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is also not mentioned as a data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV files may be used to store metadata or annotations associated with the image data.
