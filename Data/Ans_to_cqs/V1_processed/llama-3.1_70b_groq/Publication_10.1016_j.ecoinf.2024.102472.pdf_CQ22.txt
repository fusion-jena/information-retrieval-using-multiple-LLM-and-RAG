The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention some metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models, specifically:

* R2 (coefficient of determination)
* RMSE (root mean square error)
* MAE (mean absolute error)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the XGBoost and ANN models in predicting reforestation carbon stock. The context does not provide information on accuracy, precision, and recall, which are typically used to evaluate classification models. The models in this context appear to be regression models, as they are predicting continuous values (carbon stock).
