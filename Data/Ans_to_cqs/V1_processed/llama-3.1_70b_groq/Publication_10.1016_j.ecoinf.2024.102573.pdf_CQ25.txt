The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is classification, specifically bird species classification. The text mentions that recent years have seen impressive progress in bird species recognition and related tasks, and that deep learning has emerged as the most successful method for large-scale bioacoustics analysis. The model is trained on various types of input features, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), visual features extracted from the Constant-Q Transform (CQT) time-frequency representation, and waveform, to classify bird species.

The text also mentions that the model is used to capture all the relevant information from bird vocalization, and that training a neural network directly on the CQT was the best choice among the features. Additionally, the text mentions that other successful contemporary works have explored various types of neural networks as species recognizers by leveraging Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT or spectrogram) and its relatives.

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning model is to classify bird species based on their vocalizations, which is a classification task.
