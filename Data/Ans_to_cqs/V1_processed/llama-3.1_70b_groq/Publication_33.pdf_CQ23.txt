The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of two independent databases: T0 for training the classification model and T1 for tuning the risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class. This suggests that the model was trained and validated on separate datasets, which is a common practice to ensure the generalizability of a model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a second and independent database (T1) for tuning the risk threshold, which implies that the model was validated on a separate dataset after training. However, it does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

Therefore, while the use of separate datasets for training and validation is mentioned, the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
