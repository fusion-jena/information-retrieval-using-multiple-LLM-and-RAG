The purpose of the deep learning model is detection, specifically for detecting artisanal small-scale mining. According to the context, the model uses a Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network to detect artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana. The model's flexibility also allows it to be deconstructed for urban reclassification, but its primary purpose is mining detection. Additionally, the model is designed to classify mining areas, as evidenced by the step "Select Mining Pixels Above 3 pixel sizes" which aims to remove isolated, small, misclassified pixels and only select mines above a certain size.
