The provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model. However, it does discuss hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning models, including LightGBM (LGBM), Gradient Boosting (GB), Decision Tree, and Random Forest (RF).

For the LGBM model, the hyperparameters mentioned include:

* n_estimators
* learning_rate
* max_depth
* random_state
* subsamples
* min_child_samples
* reg_lambda

For the GB model, the hyperparameters mentioned are not explicitly listed, but it is mentioned that the same hyperparameters as the LGBM model are used.

There is no mention of a deep learning model or its associated hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
