Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the analysis of urban acoustic environments (AE) and the use of machine learning approaches for sound event classification, but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
