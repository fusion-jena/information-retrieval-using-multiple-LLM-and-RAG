Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of processing large amounts of data, particularly images, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images.

However, it does mention that the model, MegaDetector, is likely to detect animals when they occupy at least 60px in an image, and that other image characteristics such as complex vegetation, poor lighting, low image resolution, and unique camera angles are likely to decrease MegaDetector's overall performance.

It does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used to train the model or improve its performance. If you're looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I would recommend consulting additional sources or research papers on deep learning and computer vision.
