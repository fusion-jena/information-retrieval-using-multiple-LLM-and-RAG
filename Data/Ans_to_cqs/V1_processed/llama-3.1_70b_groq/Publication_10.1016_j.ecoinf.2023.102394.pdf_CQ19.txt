The provided context mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP), for modeling soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS). However, it does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model.

However, one of the references listed is "Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., et al., 2016. Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning." This suggests that TensorFlow may be the framework used to build the deep learning model, but it is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of R, a programming language and environment for statistical computing, and the Keras package, which is a high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow, among other frameworks. However, it does not provide enough information to confirm whether TensorFlow or another framework is used to build the deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that TensorFlow might be the framework used, but it is not explicitly stated, and other frameworks like PyTorch are not mentioned at all.
