The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Specifically, it is a feedforward neural network with one or more hidden layers. The configuration of the MLP model used in the pipeline includes 10 neurons per hidden layer, an Adam solver, a constant learning rate, and a rectifier activation function (ReLU).
