The provided context mentions the use of GPUs for training autoencoders for bird sound data processing. Specifically, it references the paper "Gpu-based training of autoencoders for bird sound data processing" by Guo et al. (2017). This suggests that GPUs are used as the hardware resource for training the deep learning model. There is no mention of TPUs or other hardware resources being used for training.
