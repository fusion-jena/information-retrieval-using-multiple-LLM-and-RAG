Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, color blindness, and scientific communication, with a focus on the use of color in maps and data visualization. It does not provide information on deep learning or data splitting criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
