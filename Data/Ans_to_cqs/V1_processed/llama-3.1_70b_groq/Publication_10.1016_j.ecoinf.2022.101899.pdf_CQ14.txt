I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to consider model uncertainty, the interpretation of Bayes factors, and the correlation between model parameters. It also describes the prior distributions on the model parameters and the use of a multivariate normal distribution to represent the correlations between the parameters. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized.
