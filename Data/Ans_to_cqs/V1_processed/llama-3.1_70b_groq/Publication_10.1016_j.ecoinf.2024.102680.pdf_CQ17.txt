Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various techniques such as dilated convolution, depthwise separable convolution, and reweighting strategy to address specific challenges, but it does not provide information on regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it is mentioned that the batch size of all networks is set to 16 uniformly, which might be a way to prevent overfitting by reducing the effect of individual samples on the model's parameters. But this is not a traditional regularization method.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
