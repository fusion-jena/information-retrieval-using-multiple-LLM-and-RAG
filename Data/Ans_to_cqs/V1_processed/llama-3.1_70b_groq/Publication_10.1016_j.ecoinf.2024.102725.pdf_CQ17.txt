Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on NDVI reconstruction and time-series analysis, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
