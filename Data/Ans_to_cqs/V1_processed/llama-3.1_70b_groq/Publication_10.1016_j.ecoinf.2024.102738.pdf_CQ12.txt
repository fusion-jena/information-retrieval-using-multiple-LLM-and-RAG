I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It discusses various topics such as datasets, spectral bands, vegetation indices, soil indices, water indices, and land use/land cover (LULC) classification, but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model used. The only mention of a machine learning model is Random Forest, which is mentioned in the abstract as a keyword, but it is not clear if it is the model used in the pipeline.
