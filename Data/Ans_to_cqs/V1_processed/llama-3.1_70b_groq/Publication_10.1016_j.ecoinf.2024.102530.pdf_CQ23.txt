Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model, specifically the Apis-FIS model, which is used for evaluating the suitability of areas for beekeeping. The context mentions the use of field data and validation data for model validation, but it does not provide information on the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
