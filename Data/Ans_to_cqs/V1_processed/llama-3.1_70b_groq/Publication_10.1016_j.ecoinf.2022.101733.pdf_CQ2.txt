The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses multi-source remote sensing (RS) images, including optical and radar time series data, as well as derived features such as spectral indices and textural features.

Specifically, the context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 data, which is a type of satellite imagery, and Sentinel-1 data, which is a type of radar imagery. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a cloud-based platform for analyzing satellite and other Earth observation data.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data formats used in the pipeline are likely to be image-based, such as GeoTIFF or other raster formats, rather than audio, video, or CSV files. However, without more explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
