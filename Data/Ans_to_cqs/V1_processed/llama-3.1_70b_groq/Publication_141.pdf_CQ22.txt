The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are accuracy and misclassified images. The accuracy is reported as a percentage, indicating the proportion of correctly classified images. The misclassified images are also reported as a number and a percentage of the total number of images in the training and validation sets.

Specifically, the accuracy is reported at different taxonomic levels, including species, genus, and subfamily. The accuracy is also reported for both the training and validation sets. For example, the accuracy for the species model is 99.47% for the validation set, while the accuracy for the genus and subfamily models is 100% for the validation set.

There is no mention of precision and recall in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if these metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
