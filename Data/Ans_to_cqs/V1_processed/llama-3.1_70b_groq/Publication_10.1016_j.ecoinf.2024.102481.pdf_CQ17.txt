Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the use of Random Forest (RF) machine learning method for classification of reproductive condition in fish, specifically Chilean hake. It discusses the advantages of using RFs over traditional methods, such as macroscopy and histology, and mentions the high accuracy and specificity of the RF classifier. However, it does not mention deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
