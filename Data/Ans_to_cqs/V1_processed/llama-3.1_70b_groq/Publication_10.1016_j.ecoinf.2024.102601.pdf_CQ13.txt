I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. It discusses the use of RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library for hyperparameter optimization of a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, but it does not provide information about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
