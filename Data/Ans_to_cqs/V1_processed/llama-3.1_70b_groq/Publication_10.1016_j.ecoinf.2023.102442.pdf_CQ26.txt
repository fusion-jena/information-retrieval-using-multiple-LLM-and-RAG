Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning techniques for detecting artisanal small-scale mining, Amazonian rainforest phenology, and other environmental monitoring tasks.

However, it does mention the use of semi-automated reclassification and data-fusion reclassification approaches, but these are not directly related to addressing data bias during preprocessing.

The context also mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which provides a cloud-based environment for geospatial analysis, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
