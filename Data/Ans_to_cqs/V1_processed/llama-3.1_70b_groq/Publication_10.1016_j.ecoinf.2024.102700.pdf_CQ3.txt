I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that deep learning strategies, including neural networks, have been used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques employed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
