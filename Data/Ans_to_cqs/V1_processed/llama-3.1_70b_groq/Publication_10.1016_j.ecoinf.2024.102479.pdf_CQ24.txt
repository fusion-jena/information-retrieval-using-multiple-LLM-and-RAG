Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on various topics related to machine learning, remote sensing, and ecology, but it does not specifically address the management of randomness in deep learning.

However, I can provide some general information on this topic. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as weight initialization, dropout, and data shuffling. To handle this randomness, researchers often employ strategies like setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques like stratified sampling, or utilizing methods like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the results.

Unfortunately, without more specific information or context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question.
