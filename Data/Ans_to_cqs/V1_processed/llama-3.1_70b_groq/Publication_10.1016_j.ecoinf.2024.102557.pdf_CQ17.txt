Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning and machine learning in ecology, conservation biology, and environmental science, highlighting various studies and their findings. 

However, it does mention the use of deep learning techniques in ecology, citing Christin et al. (2019), which discusses the applications of deep learning in ecology. While this study might touch upon regularization methods, the provided context does not specifically mention them.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the given context. If you're looking for information on regularization methods in deep learning, I recommend consulting a more comprehensive resource or the original study by Christin et al. (2019) for more details.
