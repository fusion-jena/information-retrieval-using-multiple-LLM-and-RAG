Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data include:

1. Gauge data and satellite-based precipitation data from the CMAP (Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation) dataset, which can be downloaded from the NOAA repository.
2. Landsat satellite datasets, which were used to investigate water surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time (1985-2020).
3. UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images, which were used to collect near-map images using UAV-carried spectrometers.

Additionally, the context mentions that radiometric calibration was done for the selected Landsat images to minimize radiometric effects.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention surveys as a method for collecting raw data. The focus appears to be on remote sensing data from satellites and UAVs.
