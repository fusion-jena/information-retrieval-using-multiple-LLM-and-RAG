Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to a study on marine organism acoustics and functional data analysis, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used after model training.

However, based on general machine learning practices, common postprocessing steps after model training may include:

* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), R2 (Coefficient of Determination), etc. to evaluate the performance of the model. The provided context does mention RMSE and MAE values, but it does not explicitly state that these metrics were calculated as part of the postprocessing steps.
* Saliency maps: These are visual representations of the importance of input features in predicting the output. However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context.
* Confusion matrix: This is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. However, the provided context does not mention a confusion matrix or any classification-related metrics.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. If you need more information, please provide more context or clarify your question.
