The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a Wide ResNet. This is mentioned in the text as "Our model is based on a residual network or ResNet" and "We followed the original Wide ResNet design". The use of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation also supports the fact that the model is a CNN.
