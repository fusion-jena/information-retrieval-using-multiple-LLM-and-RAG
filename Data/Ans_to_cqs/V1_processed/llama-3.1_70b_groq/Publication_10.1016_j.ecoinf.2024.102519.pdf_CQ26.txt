Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and data sources, but it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

The context mentions data sources and characteristics, such as spatial resolution and data type, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques or strategies for addressing data bias. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
