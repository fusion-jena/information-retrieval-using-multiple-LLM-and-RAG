The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention the use of 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions to assess the accuracy of the models. This suggests that the training process may be evaluated based on the performance of the models on the validation sets, but the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified.

The context does mention that the goal of the 10-fold cross-validation is to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy (OA) and to reflect the resulting distribution of OA values. This implies that the training process may be considered complete when the models have achieved a satisfactory level of accuracy, but the specific criteria for determining this are not provided.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
