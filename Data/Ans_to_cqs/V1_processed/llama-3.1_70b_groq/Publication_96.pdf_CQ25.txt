The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is classification. Specifically, the model is used to classify areas as either burned or non-burned in the Cerrado biome in Brazil. The model uses spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas to learn the differences between the two classes and then applies this knowledge to map burned areas in the study region. The model's output is a classification of each area as either burned or non-burned, allowing for the creation of a map of burned areas in the Cerrado biome.
