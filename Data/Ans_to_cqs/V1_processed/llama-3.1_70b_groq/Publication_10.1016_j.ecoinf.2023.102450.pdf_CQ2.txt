The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the study consists of images and videos. 

Figure 7 shows examples of images used in the dataset, and Table 2 provides details about the dataset, including the number of videos, duration of videos, and number of images. The table also mentions specific video numbers (e.g., video 6, video 7, etc.), which suggests that the dataset includes video data. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning techniques for detecting actions in wildlife videos, which further supports the idea that video data is used in the pipeline. However, it does not provide information about the specific data formats used (e.g., MP4, AVI, JPEG, etc.). 

There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that the dataset used in the study includes image and video data, but the specific data formats are not specified.
