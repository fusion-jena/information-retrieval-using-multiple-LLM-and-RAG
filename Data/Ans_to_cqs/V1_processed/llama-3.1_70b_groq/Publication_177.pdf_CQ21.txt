The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on the information given, we can infer that some metrics calculation was performed.

The context mentions the calculation of performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score for the models trained on the UBD_45 and VP_200 datasets. The formulas for precision and F1-score are also provided.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of validation and testing data for evaluating the classification accuracies of the models, which suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation was performed. However, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, while we can confirm that some metrics calculation was performed, we do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
