Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly discusses the training and testing of the model, the architecture used, and the tools and platforms utilized, such as TensorFlow and Microsoft Azure. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The context does mention that the model training and prediction procedures were executed on Microsoft Azure using instance NV12s v3 with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM, but it does not provide further details on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
