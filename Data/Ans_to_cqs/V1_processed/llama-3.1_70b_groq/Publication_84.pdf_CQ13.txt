The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. It only discusses the parameter setting method of SVM, including the kernel type, gamma, and cost parameters. For the deep learning model, specifically the SAE method, it mentions the use of Ppf-CM and the benefits of deep learning in capturing complex information, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used.
