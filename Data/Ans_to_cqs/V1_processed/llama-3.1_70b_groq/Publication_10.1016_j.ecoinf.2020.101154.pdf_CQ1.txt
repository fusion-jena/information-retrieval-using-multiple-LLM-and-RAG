Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. In-situ observations: The context mentions "in-situ observations" as a source of data, which suggests that data is being collected through direct observations or measurements in the field.

2. AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer): The context mentions that the Reynolds Optimally Interpolated SST (Sea Surface Temperature) is derived from AVHRR, which is a satellite-based sensor that collects data on sea surface temperature.

3. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory: The context mentions that the Reynolds Historical Reconstructed SST data is available from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which suggests that this data is being collected through a combination of satellite and in-situ observations.

4. MET Office Hadley Centre EN4 quality controlled ocean data: The context mentions that this dataset is being used, which suggests that this data is being collected through a combination of observations and modeling.

5. Random splitting of individual observations: The context mentions that individual observations are being randomly split into training and test datasets, which suggests that this data is being collected through a combination of observations and machine learning techniques.

Overall, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include a combination of in-situ observations, satellite-based sensors, and public datasets.
