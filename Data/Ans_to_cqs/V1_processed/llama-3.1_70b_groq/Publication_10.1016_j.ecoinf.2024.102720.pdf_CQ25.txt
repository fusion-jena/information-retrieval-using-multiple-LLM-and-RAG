Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that scholars have started to base their research on deep learning algorithms for strategic planning (Report 1998) and that improvements have been made in deep learning models for improved fusion (Ren et al., 2021; Wu, 2022). This suggests that the deep learning model might be used for tasks such as prediction, forecasting, or analysis, but the specific purpose (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) is not specified.
