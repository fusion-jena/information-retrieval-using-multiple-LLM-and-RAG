Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the collection and analysis of data from various satellite instruments, such as Sentinel, VIIRS, and MODIS, and the development of a monitoring system. There is no mention of a deep learning model or any efforts to ensure its generalizability.

The context does mention the use of a crawling tool to collect historical and near real-time data from different SRS products, and the importance of having a high temporal resolution for the development of a monitoring system. However, it does not provide any information on the use of techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the context.
