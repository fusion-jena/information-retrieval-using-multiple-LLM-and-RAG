According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Image augmentation: This involves applying transformations to the images to increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting. The specific augmentations used include:
	* Horizontal flip
	* 0.2 degree counter-clockwise shear
	* Random zoom between 0 and 0.2
2. Normalization: The images are normalized to ImageNet mean values.
3. Rescaling: The pixel values are rescaled to the range of [0, 1].

These preprocessing steps are applied to the images before they are fed into the deep learning model for training. The specific model used is a ResNet50, which is a pre-trained model that is fine-tuned for the target species (red kites).
