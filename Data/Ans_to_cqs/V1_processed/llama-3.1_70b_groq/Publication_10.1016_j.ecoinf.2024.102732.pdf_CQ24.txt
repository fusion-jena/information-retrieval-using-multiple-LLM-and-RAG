Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, remote sensing, and machine learning, specifically random forests, for estimating aboveground biomass in forests.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in machine learning pipelines. In machine learning, randomness can be handled through techniques such as:

* Setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques such as cross-validation to reduce overfitting
* Employing ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance
* Using regularization techniques to prevent overfitting

But, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
