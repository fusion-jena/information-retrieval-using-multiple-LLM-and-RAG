I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything related to training or validation loss plateau. The context appears to be discussing drought characteristics, severity, duration, and intensity, and how they are calculated and evaluated using various formulas and indices. There is no mention of training or machine learning concepts, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
