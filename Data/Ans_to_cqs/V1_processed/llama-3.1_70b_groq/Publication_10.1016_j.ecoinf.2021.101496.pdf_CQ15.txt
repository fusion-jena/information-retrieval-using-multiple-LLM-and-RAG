Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only mentions that the artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed empirically and that a random number generator was used for numerical optimization of the model. However, it does not provide further details on the optimization techniques employed.
