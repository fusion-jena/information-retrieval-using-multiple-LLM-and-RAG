I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model being used in the pipeline. It appears to be discussing a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network, which is a type of unsupervised neural network, and a Random Forest (RF) model, which is an ensemble learning method. However, it does not mention any deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
