The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a residual neural network, specifically the ResNet50V2 model, which is a variant of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context as the chosen architecture for the fish classification by species task. Additionally, the segmentation model is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that the base model is obtained from TensorFlow Object Detection API, which typically uses CNNs for object detection tasks.
