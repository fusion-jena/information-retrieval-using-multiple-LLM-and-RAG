The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is early stopping. According to the provided context, the model stops training once the loss increases in 10 consecutive epochs (early stopping) or after 10 epochs with no improvement over the validation set. This approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is trained until it reaches optimal performance.
