I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, specifically the use of Maxent models, and discusses parameters used in Maxent, such as regularization multiplier, but does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or regularization methods used in deep learning.
