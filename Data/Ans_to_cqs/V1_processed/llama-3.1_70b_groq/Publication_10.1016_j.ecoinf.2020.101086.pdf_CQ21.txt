Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, specifically discussing correction methods for sampling bias and parameterization of these methods. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
