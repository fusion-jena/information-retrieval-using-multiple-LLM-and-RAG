The text mentions that the authors plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in the future. However, it does not specify that these models are currently used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided text, I don't know what type of deep learning model is currently used in the pipeline.
