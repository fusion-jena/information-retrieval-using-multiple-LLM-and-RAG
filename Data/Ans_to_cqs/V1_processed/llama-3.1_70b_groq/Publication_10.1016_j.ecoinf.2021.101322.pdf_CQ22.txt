The performance of the CNN models is evaluated using four different metrics: 

1. Test loss
2. Mean squared error (MSE)
3. Mean average percentage error (MAPE)
4. Accuracy (Acc)

These metrics are used to assess the performance of the CNN models in predicting river age, sea age, and spawning. The accuracy of the regression tasks is calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it with the ground truth, which is the labelling provided by human readers.
