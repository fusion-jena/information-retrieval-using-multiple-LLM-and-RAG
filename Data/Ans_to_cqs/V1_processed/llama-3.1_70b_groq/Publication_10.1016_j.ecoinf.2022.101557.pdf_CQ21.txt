The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does describe the post-processing steps involved in transforming the result of the CNN into an easy-to-access GIS resource.

According to the context, the post-processing steps involved are:

1. Rounding the pixel predictions from the CNN, where all predictions with a value larger than 0.5 are considered as wetlands and all predictions below are considered as non-wetlands.
2. Converting the raster representation into a vector representation to enable further analyses, minimize storage space, and make it easier to distribute.

These steps are primarily done to produce and refine the material covering southern Sweden and make it easily accessible for further analyses.

There is no mention of Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know the specific post-processing steps involved after model training, beyond the two steps mentioned above.
