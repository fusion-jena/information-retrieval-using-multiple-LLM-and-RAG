The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are image and audio. According to the provided context, the audio data is converted into images that represent the audio energy of a certain record in a time and frequency graph. These images are then used as input for the deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for audio pattern identification and classification.
