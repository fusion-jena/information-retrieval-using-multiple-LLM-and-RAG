The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of fusion methods (average or max voting) to combine the softmax outputs of the networks during the validation phase. This suggests that some form of ensemble method or model combination was used, which can help improve the generalizability of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a validation set for deconvolution results, which implies that some form of validation or testing was performed to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. However, it does not provide details on whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used.

The context also highlights the limitations of the PlantClef2015 dataset, which has a relatively small number of images compared to other datasets. This could potentially impact the generalizability of the model, as it may not have seen enough diverse examples during training.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the evaluation and validation of the model, it does not provide a clear answer to the question of what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
