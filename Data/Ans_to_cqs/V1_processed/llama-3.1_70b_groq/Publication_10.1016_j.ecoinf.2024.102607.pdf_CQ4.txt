Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses sampling techniques for addressing unbalanced training data in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, including undersampling, oversampling, and combinations of both. It also mentions a hexagonal random-sampling strategy and a tile model, but these are not traditional data augmentation techniques.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of image presegmentation, which is a technique used in object-based classification, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
