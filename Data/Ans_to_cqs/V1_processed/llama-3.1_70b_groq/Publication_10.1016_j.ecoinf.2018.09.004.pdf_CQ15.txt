Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on feature selection methods, classification algorithms (e.g., K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree), and the use of machine learning algorithms for a specific environmental application. It does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
