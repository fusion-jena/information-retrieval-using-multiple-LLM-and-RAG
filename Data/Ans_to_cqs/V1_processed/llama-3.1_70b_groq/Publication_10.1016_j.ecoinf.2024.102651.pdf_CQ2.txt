The text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses image data. The text mentions the use of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and ViT (Vision Transformer) modules, which are typically used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the text mentions the classification of microorganisms and Cervidae, which suggests that the pipeline is working with image data. However, the specific format of the image data (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) is not mentioned.
