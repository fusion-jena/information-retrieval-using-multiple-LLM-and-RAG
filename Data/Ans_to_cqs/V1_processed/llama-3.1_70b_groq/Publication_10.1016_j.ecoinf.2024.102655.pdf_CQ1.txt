Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the data is related to water quality parameters, and the study involves monitoring sites along a river.

From the context, it can be inferred that the data might be collected through sensors or monitoring equipment, as the study mentions "online water quality monitoring" and "monitoring network". Additionally, the context mentions "sampling points" and "monitoring sites", which suggests that the data might be collected through field measurements or sampling.

However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
