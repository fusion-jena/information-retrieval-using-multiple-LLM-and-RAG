Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including the use of k-fold cross-validation, the training data, and the evaluation metrics (mAP50, precision, recall). It also provides a summary of the trained models, including their performance and training time. However, it does not provide any information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
