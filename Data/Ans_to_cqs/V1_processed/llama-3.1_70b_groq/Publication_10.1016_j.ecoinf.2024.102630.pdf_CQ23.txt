I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any information about a deep learning model, its development, or the measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, NDVI data, and land cover changes, but it does not provide any details about a deep learning model or its evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
