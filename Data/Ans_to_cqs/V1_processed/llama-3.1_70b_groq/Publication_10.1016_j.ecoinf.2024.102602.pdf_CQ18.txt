The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of an early stop approach with a patience value of 16. This approach is used to regularize the model and minimize the loss function (binary cross entropy). The early stop approach is a common technique in machine learning that halts the training process of a model prematurely if performance on a validation dataset fails to improve beyond a predefined threshold, thereby preventing overfitting and conserving computational resources.
