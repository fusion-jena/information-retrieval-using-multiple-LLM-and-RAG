Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the "recent availability of powerful hardware" as a factor contributing to the growth of deep learning, but it does not provide details on the type of hardware used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
