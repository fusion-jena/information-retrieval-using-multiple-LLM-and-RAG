The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information on the composition of the experiments' data sets in Table 3. 

The table shows that the data sets are split into training, validation, and test sets, with varying observation times and frame counts. For example, the first row shows that the training data set has 271,909 frames, the validation data set has 90,639 frames, and the test data set has 90,636 frames, all with an observation time of 30 seconds and 120 frames.

While the exact criteria for splitting the data are not specified, it appears that the data sets are split into roughly 75% for training, 25% for validation, and 25% for testing, based on the frame counts. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used for splitting the data.
