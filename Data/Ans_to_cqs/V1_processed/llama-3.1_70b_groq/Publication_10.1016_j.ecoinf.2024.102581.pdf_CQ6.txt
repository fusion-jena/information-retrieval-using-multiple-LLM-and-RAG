Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a proposed approach and compares the performance of various pre-trained CNN models on different datasets.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed on the datasets (Mendeley and CVIP100) used for training and testing the models, as the context mentions the use of labeled training data and the application of techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the given context. If you have any further information or clarification regarding the preprocessing steps, I would be happy to try and assist you.
