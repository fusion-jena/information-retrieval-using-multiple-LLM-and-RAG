Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article discussing ecological informatics, specifically focusing on simulation and observation of direct flow (m3/s) over a period of time. There is no mention of model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
