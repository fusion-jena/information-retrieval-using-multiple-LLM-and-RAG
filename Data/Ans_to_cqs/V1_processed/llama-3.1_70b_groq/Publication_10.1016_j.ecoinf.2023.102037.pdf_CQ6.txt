Based on the provided context, it appears that the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data splitting and image tiling. Specifically, the images were sliced into smaller tiles of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) to maintain their original pixel dimensions, which is important for detecting small insects. This was done using the Python library "impy" to ensure that the tiles contain the maximum number of complete bounding boxes and exclude image regions without bounding boxes.

However, the context does not mention any specific normalization, scaling, or cleaning steps. It only mentions the tiling process, which is a form of data preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.

It is worth noting that the context does provide information on the camera settings used to capture the images, including aperture, ISO, shutter speed, focal length, and white balance. However, it does not explicitly state how these settings were used in the preprocessing steps.
