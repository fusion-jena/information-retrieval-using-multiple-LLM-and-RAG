Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, we can make some inferences based on the information provided.

In the paper "A Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana: applying deep learning to shallow mining" by Gallwey et al. (2020), the authors mention that they used a large-scale dataset, but they do not provide details on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.

In another paper, "Mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at large scale from space with deep learning" by Couttenier et al. (2022), the authors mention that they used a diverse dataset, but again, they do not provide details on cross-validation or stratified splitting.

The paper "Google Earth engine: planetary-scale geospatial analysis for everyone" by Gorelick et al. (2017) provides an overview of the Google Earth Engine platform, which is used for large-scale geospatial analysis, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability of deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
