Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the deep learning models used for alate detection on sorghum leaves, the dataset splitting ratio, and the hyperparameters used for training. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection, that are used to address data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions that the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets in a ratio of 80:10:10, which is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on a representative sample of the data. But it does not provide information on whether any techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
