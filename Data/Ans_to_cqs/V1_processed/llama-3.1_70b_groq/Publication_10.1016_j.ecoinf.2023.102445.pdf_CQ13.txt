The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Batch size: 16
* Input image resolution: 640 Ã— 640
* Number of epochs: 150
* Learning rate: 0.01
* Optimizer: Adam
* Depth_scale parameter: 0.33
* Width_scale parameter: 0.25

These hyperparameters were used in the experimental training parameter settings for the 10 ablation experiments conducted in the paper.
