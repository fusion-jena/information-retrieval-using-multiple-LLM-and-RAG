The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various data sources and types used in the study, such as:

* Land Use/Land Cover Map (LULC)
* Database of parcels and declared agricultural production (BDPPAD)
* Geobase of the Quebec hydrographic network (GRHQ)
* Geobase Adresses Quebec
* Weather data
* MNT-Lidar data

These data sources are mentioned as being used in the study, but it is not clear if they are used as part of a deep learning pipeline or for other purposes. Additionally, the context mentions a survey conducted with beekeepers in Quebec, which may be used to collect raw data, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only mention the various data sources and types used in the study, but I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.
