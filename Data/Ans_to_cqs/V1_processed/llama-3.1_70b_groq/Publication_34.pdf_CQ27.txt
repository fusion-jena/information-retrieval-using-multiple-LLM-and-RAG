Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the training process, including the initialization of model parameters, the optimization algorithm used (stochastic gradient descent with momentum), and the evaluation metrics. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
