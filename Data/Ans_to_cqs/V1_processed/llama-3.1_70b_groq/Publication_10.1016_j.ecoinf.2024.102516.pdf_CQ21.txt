Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the 3-phase processing pipeline for training the network, including the use of classification networks, segmentation networks, and transfer learning. It also discusses the motivation behind the segmentation pre-training approach and the potential benefits of utilizing external training data.

However, it does mention the use of class activation mapping to generate weak segmentation maps during the first phase of the training pipeline. This could be related to the generation of saliency maps, but it is not explicitly stated as a postprocessing step.

Regarding metrics calculation and confusion matrix, there is no mention of these in the provided context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
