Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the training settings for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with and without overfitting, and discusses the importance of generalization in deep learning models. It also mentions the use of batch normalization in the no-overfitting setting, but this is not a preprocessing step per se, rather a technique used during training to normalize the inputs to each layer.

Therefore, I don't know what specific preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
