I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) in the pipeline. The context appears to focus on data modeling, vocabularies, and data management for fish scale and otolith samples, but it does not provide information on the specific machine learning or deep learning techniques used in the pipeline.
