Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that batch normalization was performed using the adaptive normalization operator proposed by Chen et al. (2017) within the network architecture. This suggests that some form of normalization was applied, but the specific details of the preprocessing steps are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network was trained on a dataset of bird sound signals, but it does not provide information on how the data was preprocessed before training. It is possible that the data was cleaned, scaled, or normalized in some way, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that batch normalization was used within the network architecture, but we do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
