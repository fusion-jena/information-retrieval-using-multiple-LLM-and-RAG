Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text explains the XGBoost model and its ensemble approach, as well as the division of the training and validation sets, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
