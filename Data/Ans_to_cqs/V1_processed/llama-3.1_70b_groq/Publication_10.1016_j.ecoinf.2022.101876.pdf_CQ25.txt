The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the MegaDetector, is object detection and classification. It is designed to detect and classify objects in images, particularly in the context of wildlife camera trap images. The model uses a two-step process, first identifying regions in an image that contain an object, and then examining the attributes of those regions to assign objects to a particular class. The model classifies objects as either an animal, human, or truck, and provides a confidence value indicating the model's confidence in the selected object class. The primary purpose of the MegaDetector is to automate the task of detecting and classifying wildlife in images, thereby expediting the processing of large volumes of camera trap data and reducing the time-consuming burden of manual review and labeling.
