Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the optimization of model training parameters, the use of TensorBoard for performance analysis, and the application of deep learning in the field of fisheries. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
