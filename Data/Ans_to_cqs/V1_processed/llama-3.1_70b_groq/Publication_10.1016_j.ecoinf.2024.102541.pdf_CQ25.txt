The purpose of the deep learning model is species recognition, specifically for wildlife conservation efforts. The model is designed to aid in rapid analysis and real-time recognition of species, enabling conservation efforts through efficient and accurate identification. The model is also applied to plant disease classification and detection, as mentioned in the references provided. However, the primary focus of the model discussed in the context is on wildlife conservation and species recognition.
