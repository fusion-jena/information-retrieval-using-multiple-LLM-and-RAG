Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the architecture and components of various deep learning models, such as LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, as well as the inception module and other layers used in the ICSNet model. It also briefly mentions the use of the ILSVRC dataset, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
