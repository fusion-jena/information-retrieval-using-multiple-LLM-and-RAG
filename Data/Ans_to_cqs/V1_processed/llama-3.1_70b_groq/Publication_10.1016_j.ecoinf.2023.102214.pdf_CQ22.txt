The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include top-k accuracy, precision, recall, and Average Precision (AP). 

Top-k accuracy is used to assess the efficacy of the various techniques, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of the correct match within a list of proposed matches. 

Precision-Recall performance curves are also calculated to evaluate the trained model's accuracy and comprehensive detection success. The Average Precision (AP), as measured by the area under the curve, is a standard approach for summarizing accuracy. 

In the context of the snow leopard recognition model, the best-performing configuration achieves an AP of 94.45%. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated at a fixed recall of 80% to determine the best possible accuracy across all possible configurations.
