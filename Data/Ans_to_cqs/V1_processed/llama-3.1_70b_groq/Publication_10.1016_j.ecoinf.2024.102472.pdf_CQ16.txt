The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the network was trained until reaching a target minimal error. Specifically, it states that "Iterative error back-propagation adjusted connection weights until reaching a target minimal error." This suggests that the training process was stopped when the error reached a certain threshold, but the exact criteria used to determine this threshold are not specified.
