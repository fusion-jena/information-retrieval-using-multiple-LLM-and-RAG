I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that deep learning methods, specifically CNN, can be used for future LULC analysis, but it does not provide any details about the model's architecture or hyperparameters. The context appears to be focused on the supervised learning workflow, data collection, and results of a study, rather than the specifics of a deep learning model.
