Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and land cover classification, with references to various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed common techniques used to handle imbalanced datasets and reduce bias. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class.

Diverse data collection is also an important aspect of reducing bias in machine learning models. Collecting data from diverse sources and ensuring that the data represents the population of interest can help reduce bias and improve model generalizability.

It's worth noting that the context does mention the use of a "graded proportion method of training sample selection" in the paper by Liu et al. (2020), which may be related to addressing data bias. However, without more information, it's unclear how this method is specifically used to address bias.
