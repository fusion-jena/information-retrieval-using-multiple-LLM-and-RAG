The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is classification. The model is designed to classify bird songs into different dialects. The CNN is trained on spectrograms of bird songs, and its goal is to identify the dialect of a given bird song. The model is part of a larger system called DialectDecoder, which uses a combination of machine learning and human expertise to classify bird songs.
