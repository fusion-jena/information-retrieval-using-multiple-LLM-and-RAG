I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of deep learning LSTM models for predicting air quality, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The references cited in the context are research papers and articles that discuss various topics related to air quality, pollution, and environmental science, but they do not mention the deployment platform for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
