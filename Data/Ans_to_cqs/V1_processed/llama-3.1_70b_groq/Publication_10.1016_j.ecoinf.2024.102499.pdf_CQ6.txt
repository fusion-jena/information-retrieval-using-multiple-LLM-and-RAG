According to the provided context, before training the deep learning model, the images were resized to 1333 Ã— 800 pixels to match with the pre-training data (COCO dataset) used to prepare the first layers of the model and save computing time during the training phase. However, there is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, the only preprocessing step mentioned is resizing the images to a specific size.
