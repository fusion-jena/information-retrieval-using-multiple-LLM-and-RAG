Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on transfer learning, feature extraction, and fine-tuning using pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3. It discusses the challenges of training deep CNNs with limited training samples and how transfer learning can help overcome these challenges. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
