Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text appears to be a research article or paper related to using machine learning for sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model. It mentions the use of R programming language and references various research papers, but it does not specify the hardware resources used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
