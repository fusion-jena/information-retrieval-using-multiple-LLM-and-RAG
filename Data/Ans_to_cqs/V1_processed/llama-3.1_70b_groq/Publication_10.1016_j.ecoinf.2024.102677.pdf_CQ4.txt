Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the use of deep learning methods, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification and landscape type prediction. It mentions the fine-tuning of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including VGG, Inception, and ResNet, but does not provide details on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
