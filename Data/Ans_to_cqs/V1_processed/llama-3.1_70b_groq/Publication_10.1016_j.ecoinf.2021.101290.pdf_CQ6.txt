Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and infrastructure for machine learning, event-stream processing, and automated annotation and analysis, rather than the specifics of deep learning model training.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in deep learning model training, although this is not directly supported by the provided context. Typically, preprocessing steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model stability and convergence
* Feature extraction: selecting and transforming relevant features from the data to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data

Please note that these preprocessing steps are general practices in deep learning and may not be specific to the context provided. If you're looking for specific information on preprocessing steps for a particular deep learning model or application, I recommend consulting relevant literature or documentation.
