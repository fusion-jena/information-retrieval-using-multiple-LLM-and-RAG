I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to wildlife conservation and ecology, specifically focusing on the northern bobwhite bird species. It discusses topics such as population declines, hunting quotas, and methods for estimating population density. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context, so I am unable to provide a relevant answer to the query.
