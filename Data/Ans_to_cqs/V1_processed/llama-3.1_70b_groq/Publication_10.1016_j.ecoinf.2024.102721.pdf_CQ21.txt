Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, some relevant information can be inferred from the text.

The context mentions the use of SHAP values to explain the contribution of features to the prediction, which suggests that some form of feature attribution or saliency analysis may be performed after model training. However, it does not provide details on the specific steps involved.

Regarding metrics calculation, the context mentions the use of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) to evaluate the model's performance. This suggests that these metrics are calculated after model training to assess its performance.

There is no mention of a confusion matrix in the provided context. A confusion matrix is typically used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, but the context does not indicate whether the model is a classification or regression model.

In summary, the postprocessing steps that can be inferred from the context are:

* Calculation of SHAP values for feature attribution
* Calculation of metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R2 to evaluate model performance

However, the context does not provide a comprehensive list of postprocessing steps, and some steps may be missing.
