I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the architecture of a neural network, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), and the HyperBand algorithm for hyperparameter optimization. It discusses the structure of the network, the types of layers, and the hyperparameters that need to be tuned, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
