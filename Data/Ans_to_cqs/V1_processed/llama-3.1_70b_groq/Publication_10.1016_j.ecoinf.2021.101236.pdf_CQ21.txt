Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model design, architecture, and training process, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
