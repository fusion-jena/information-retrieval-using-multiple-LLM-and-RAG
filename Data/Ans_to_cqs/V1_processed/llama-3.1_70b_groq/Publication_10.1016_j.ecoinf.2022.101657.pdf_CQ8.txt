Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and references related to the use of deep learning techniques for species identification in camera trap images, but it does not provide information on where the code is hosted.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question. The code repository might be available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without further information, I cannot provide a specific answer.
