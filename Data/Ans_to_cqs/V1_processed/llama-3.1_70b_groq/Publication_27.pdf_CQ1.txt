Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and numbers, which does not provide any meaningful information about data collection methods.

However, I can provide some general information about common methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These methods may include:

* Surveys: Collecting data through online or offline surveys, which can be used to gather information about user behavior, preferences, or opinions.
* Sensors: Using sensors to collect data from the physical world, such as temperature, humidity, or motion sensors.
* Public datasets: Utilizing publicly available datasets, such as those provided by government agencies, research institutions, or online platforms.
* Web scraping: Extracting data from websites, social media, or online forums.
* IoT devices: Collecting data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart home devices or wearables.
* Crowdsourcing: Collecting data through crowdsourcing platforms, where users contribute data or annotations.

Please note that this information is not derived from the provided context, but rather from general knowledge about data collection methods. If you have any further questions or would like more specific information, please let me know.
