The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, but rather object-oriented nearest neighbor classification and random forest classification. However, it does provide evaluation metrics for these models.

According to the context, the following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the classification models:

1. Producer accuracy: This metric is reported for each class in Tables 7 and 9.
2. User accuracy: This metric is also reported for each class in Tables 7 and 9.
3. Overall accuracy: This metric is reported in Tables 7, 9, and 10.
4. Kappa: This metric is reported in Tables 7, 9, and 10.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the object-oriented nearest neighbor classification and random forest classification models in 2020 and 2021.
