Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on discussing the challenges of working with weakly labeled data, particularly in the context of regression tasks, and introducing a new computational setting for regression with structurally incomplete target labels. It also touches on the application of this setting to predictive modeling of global vegetation cover.

While the context mentions the importance of exploiting target labels in real-world predictive tasks, it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. These steps are typically crucial in preparing data for training deep learning models, but the context does not provide information on this topic.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
