The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the provided context is based on a percentage split. The dataset is divided into two parts: a training dataset and a validation dataset. The training dataset consists of 85% of the images (111,244/130,858), while the validation dataset consists of 15% of the images (19,614/130,858). This split is done using a Python script called Making_dataset.py in Waveman. 

Additionally, the dataset is also balanced to ensure that rare species with small image numbers are not under-represented and under-classified relative to common species. This is done by providing an upper limit for species with too much data and developing a method to increase the number of images for rare species.
