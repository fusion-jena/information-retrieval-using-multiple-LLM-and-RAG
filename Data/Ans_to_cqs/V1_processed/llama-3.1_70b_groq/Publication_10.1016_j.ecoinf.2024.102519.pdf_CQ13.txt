Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that genetic optimization algorithms were used to adjust the hyperparameters, but it does not provide the specific values or settings used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
