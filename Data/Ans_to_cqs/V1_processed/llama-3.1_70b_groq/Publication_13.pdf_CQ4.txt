Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of domain adversarial training (DANN) for between-datasets classification and the performance of within-dataset classification. It also mentions the use of CNN models and the effect of increasing numbers of training images on accuracy. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
