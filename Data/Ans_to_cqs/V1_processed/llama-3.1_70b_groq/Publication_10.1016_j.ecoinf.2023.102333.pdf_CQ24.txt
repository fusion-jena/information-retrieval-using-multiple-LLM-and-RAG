Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a dropout layer to prevent overfitting and reduce statistical noise. The dropout regularization randomly removes different sets of neurons using a predetermined dropout rate, which results in training different neural networks and reduces overfitting.

While this is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that the authors are aware of the importance of managing randomness in their models. However, the specific strategies employed to handle randomness, such as setting a random seed value, are not discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this question. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
