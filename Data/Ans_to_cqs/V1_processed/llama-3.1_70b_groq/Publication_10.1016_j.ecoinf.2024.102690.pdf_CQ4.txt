I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological source identification, spatial analysis, and landscape ecology, but it does not discuss deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
