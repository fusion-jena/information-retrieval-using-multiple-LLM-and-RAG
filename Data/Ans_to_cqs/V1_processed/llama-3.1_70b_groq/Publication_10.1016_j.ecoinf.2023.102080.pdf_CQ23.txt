The text does not mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does describe the use of various statistical models, including GLM, GAM, and RF, and the measures taken to ensure their generalizability.

According to the text, the generalizability of the models was ensured through a split-sample strategy, where the data was split into training and validation sets. Specifically, 30% of the data was kept aside for validation, and the remaining 70% was used for training. This process was repeated 100 times to obtain an average "Score" value.

Additionally, the text mentions that the models were fitted using a 10-core central processing unit strategy with AMD EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster, but it does not provide information on cross-validation or stratified splitting.

It is also worth noting that the text mentions the use of random covariate sets in the model fitting process, which may help to ensure the generalizability of the models by reducing the impact of any particular covariate set. However, the text does not provide further details on this aspect.
