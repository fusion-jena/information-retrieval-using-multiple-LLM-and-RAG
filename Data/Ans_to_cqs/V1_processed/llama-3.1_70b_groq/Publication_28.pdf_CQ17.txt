Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the structure of Variational Autoencoder (VAE), the reparameterization trick, and the performance validation of the proposed PTDLEN-VAE model for satellite imagery analysis.

However, it does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on backpropagation (BP) and the employment of the BP technique for learning the entire network parameters. But it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
