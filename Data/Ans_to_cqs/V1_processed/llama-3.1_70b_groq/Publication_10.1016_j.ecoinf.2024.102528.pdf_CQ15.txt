Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only mentions the use of the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model and its application to bird species monitoring, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
