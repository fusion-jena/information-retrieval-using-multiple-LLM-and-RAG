The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for analyzing the urban acoustic environment. However, it does mention that the analyses were performed using Python 3.8.5 and corresponding packages, and that a list of packages and their versions, as well as Python code for the analyses, are provided on GitHub.

That being said, the context does mention the steps involved in constructing complex networks from large-scale acoustic data, which includes:

1. FCM (Fuzzy C-Means clustering)
2. Thresholding
3. Construction of the adjacency matrix
4. Network representation

These steps are part of the process of analyzing the urban acoustic environment, but they may not be directly related to the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
