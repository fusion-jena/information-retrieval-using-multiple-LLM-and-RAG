Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the Faster R-CNN approach, including the Region Proposal Network (RPN), feature extractor network, and Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer. It also discusses the loss function used for training the CNN detection network, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used.
