The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of several satellite image datasets, including:

1. SAT-4 and SAT-6 datasets, which were presented by Liu et al. (2020) for high-resolution satellite imagery classification.
2. UCM Dataset and AID Dataset, which were used to evaluate the performance of various deep learning methods, including CNN, CNN-RBFNN, CA-CNN-BiLSTM, and others.

These datasets appear to be specific to remote sensing and satellite image classification tasks, rather than general-purpose image classification datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
