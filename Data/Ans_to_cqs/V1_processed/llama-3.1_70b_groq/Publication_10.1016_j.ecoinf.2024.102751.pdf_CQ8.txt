I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or a thesis that discusses the use of remote sensing data and topographic indices to estimate soil moisture on reclaimed spoil heaps. While the text mentions the potential use of machine learning or deep neural networks to increase the accuracy of prediction, it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or implementation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
