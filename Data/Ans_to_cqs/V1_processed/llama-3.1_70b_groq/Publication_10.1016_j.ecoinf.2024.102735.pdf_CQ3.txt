Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning models, including deep learning, for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). It discusses the use of various machine learning models, such as random forest, multilayer perceptron, long-short term memory, and support vector regression, but does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
