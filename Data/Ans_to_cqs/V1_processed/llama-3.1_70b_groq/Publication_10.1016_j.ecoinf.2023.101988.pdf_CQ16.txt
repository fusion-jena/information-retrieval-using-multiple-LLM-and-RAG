I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a research study on ecological informatics, specifically a study on bird species identification using observer and audio methods in different habitats. The context includes tables with data on species identification, survey types and methods, and seasonal conditions during fieldwork sessions. However, there is no mention of training or validation loss plateau, which suggests that the context is not related to machine learning or model training. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
