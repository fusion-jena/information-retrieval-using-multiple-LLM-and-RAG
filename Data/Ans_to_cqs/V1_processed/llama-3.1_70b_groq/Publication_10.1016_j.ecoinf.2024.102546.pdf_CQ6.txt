Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include resizing the images to a compatible size with the model architecture and training efficiency. Specifically, the original weed images, which were mostly with high resolutions (over 10 megapixels), were resized to 800 Ã— 800 pixels. The resizing was done by rescaling the long side of each image to 800 and adding padding to the short side to maintain the original image aspect ratio.

Additionally, jitter and mosaic augmentations were applied, as well as random crop and scale augmentation in the case of the DINO model. However, there is no mention of normalization or cleaning as preprocessing steps.

It is also worth noting that the context does not provide information on other common preprocessing steps such as data normalization, feature scaling, or handling missing values. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these steps were performed or not.
