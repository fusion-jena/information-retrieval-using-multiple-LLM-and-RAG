According to the provided context, the data was split into training and testing sets using a repeated random sub-sampling method. Specifically, the 12,000 frames extracted from the training and testing dataset were used to generate five different data sets. Each of these sets was then split into a training/testing split of 80/20, containing 9600 frames for training and 2400 for testing. This means that 80% of the data was used for training and 20% was used for testing. There is no mention of a separate validation set, but it is mentioned that the validation performance of one of the CNN models (Model 4) is shown in a confusion matrix.
