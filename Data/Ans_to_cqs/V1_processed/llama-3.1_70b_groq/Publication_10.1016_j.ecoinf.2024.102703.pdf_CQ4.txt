I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a specific study that used a three-layer back propagation artificial neural network to predict Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) based on input data from water samples. The context mentions the architecture of the neural network, the training parameters, and the evaluation metrics used, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.
