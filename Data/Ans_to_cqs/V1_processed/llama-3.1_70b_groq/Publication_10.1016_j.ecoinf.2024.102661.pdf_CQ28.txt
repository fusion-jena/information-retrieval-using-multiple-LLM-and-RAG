I don't know. The provided text does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only discusses the methodology and results of the study, including the use of deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and the Tree-structured Parzen estimator Bayesian optimization (TPEBO) approach, but does not provide information on the deployment platform.
