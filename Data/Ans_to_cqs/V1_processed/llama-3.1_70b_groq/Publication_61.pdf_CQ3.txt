Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the methodology for building the dataset, the importance of including more examples in the dataset, and the experimental characterization of the proposed approach. It also discusses the use of a CNN for cactus recognition in aerial images and the challenges associated with background textures.

However, it does mention the use of a segmentation and crop method, based on Fourier transformations and a K-means algorithm, proposed by Xiao et al. (2018) to generate a region of interest in the images. This method is used to train a CNN for different plant species classification. But it is not clear if this method is used in the proposed approach.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
