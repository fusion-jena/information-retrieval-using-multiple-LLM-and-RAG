The context mentions that the parallel computing power provided by graphical processing units (GPUs) has led to rapid improvements in the performance of multilayer deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Additionally, the context mentions the use of libraries such as TensorFlow, which is often used with GPUs for deep learning tasks. However, it does not explicitly state that GPUs were used for training the specific deep learning model in this work. Nevertheless, based on the context, it is likely that GPUs were used for training the model. There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) being used.
