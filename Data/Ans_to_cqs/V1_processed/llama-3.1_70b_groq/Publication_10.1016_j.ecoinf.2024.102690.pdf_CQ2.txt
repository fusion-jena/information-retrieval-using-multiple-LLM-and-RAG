Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the study appear to be primarily raster and vector formats. Specifically, the following formats are mentioned:

* Raster formats:
	+ MODIS image MOD13Q1 (used for NDVI calculation)
	+ GlobeLand30
	+ ALOS World 3D-30 m
	+ China soil map based harmonized world soil database (HWSD) (v1.1)
* Vector formats:
	+ Railway and expressway data (used as a vector layer)
* Spreadsheet format:
	+ Grain prices data (used to calculate output value per unit area of grain crops)

There is no mention of image, audio, or video formats being used in the study. The study appears to focus on spatial analysis and ecological source identification using geospatial data, which is typically represented in raster and vector formats.
