The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of convolutional layers, max pooling, batch normalization, and local response normalization (LRN) layers, all of which are typical components of a CNN architecture. Additionally, the context mentions the use of inception modules, which are a type of building block commonly used in CNNs, particularly in the GoogLeNet architecture. There is no mention of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, which are typically used for sequential data or natural language processing tasks, respectively.
