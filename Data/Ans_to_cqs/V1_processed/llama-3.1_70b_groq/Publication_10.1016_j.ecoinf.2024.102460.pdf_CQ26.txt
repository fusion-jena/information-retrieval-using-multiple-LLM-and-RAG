Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on land use change modeling, ecosystem services, and deep learning applications in environmental studies. It discusses various models such as LSTM, DynaCLUE, and FMOP, but does not delve into data preprocessing techniques for addressing bias.

However, it's worth noting that the context does mention the use of random forest (RFC) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, which can be used for handling imbalanced datasets. But it does not provide specific information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, I couldn't find any relevant information in the provided context to answer the query.
