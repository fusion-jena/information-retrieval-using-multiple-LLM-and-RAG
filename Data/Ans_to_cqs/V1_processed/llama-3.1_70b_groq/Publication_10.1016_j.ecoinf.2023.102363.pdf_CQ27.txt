Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the model fine-tuning process, data acquisition, and the use of the Google Collaboratory 'Colab' platform for training. It also mentions the use of the Google Cloud Platform in a reference, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed.

However, it does mention that early stopping was set to deploy if the validation loss does not improve within 10 epochs during the fine-tuning process. This suggests that the model was set to stop training and potentially be deployed once it reached a certain level of performance, but the exact deployment process is not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
