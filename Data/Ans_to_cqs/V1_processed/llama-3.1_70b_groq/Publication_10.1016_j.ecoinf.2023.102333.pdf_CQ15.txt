The provided context mentions several optimization techniques that are applied in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it mentions:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Lecun et al. (1998) demonstrated the effectiveness of SGD for DNN training.
2. Momentum: Luo et al. (2021) showed that momentum helps overcome the limitation of SGD getting stuck in local minima by accelerating SGD convergence.
3. Dropout regularization: Gupta and Raza (2020) proved that dropout regularization is essential for controlling overfitting as network depth and complexity increase.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of optimization algorithms to find the highest accuracy from 1,788,160 hyperparameter combinations. However, it does not specify the exact optimization algorithms used.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention Adam, which is a popular optimization algorithm in deep learning. However, it does mention the use of exponential linear unit (ELU) activation functions, which can be used in conjunction with various optimization algorithms.

Overall, the context suggests that SGD, momentum, and dropout regularization are some of the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not provide an exhaustive list of all the optimization techniques used.
