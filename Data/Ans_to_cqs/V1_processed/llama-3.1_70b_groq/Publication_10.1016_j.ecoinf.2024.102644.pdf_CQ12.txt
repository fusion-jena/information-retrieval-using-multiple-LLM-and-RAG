I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine-learning models and big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence, but it does not provide details on the architecture or type of model used. The references listed at the end of the text also do not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
