The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a search process that is categorized into two phases: global search or exploration, and local search or exploitation. The algorithm tries to explore different regions within a given search range in the first phase, and this movement is random to ensure that the entire search space is covered thoroughly. In the second phase, the goal is to find promising solutions or a set of solutions from the area discovered during the first phase.

The algorithm uses a population-based approach, where multiple solutions are evaluated simultaneously, and the best solutions are selected and used to update the population. The algorithm also uses a termination criterion, which is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. The hyperparameters with the current results are saved until better accuracy is achieved.

The search space of CNN hyperparameters to be explored is defined in Table 4, which includes the range of values for each hyperparameter, such as the number of convolution layers, filters, filter size, number of neurons, batch size, epochs, and CNN model optimizer.

It is not explicitly mentioned that the algorithm uses grid search or random search, but it seems to use a more complex optimization algorithm that combines elements of both global and local search. The algorithm's complexity is dominated by the number of iterations and the population size, and the total complexity can be approximated as O(TC*NP).
