Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on ecological informatics, species distribution models, and climate modeling, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
