I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on using machine learning methods to model net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, and it discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) as machine learning methods. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
