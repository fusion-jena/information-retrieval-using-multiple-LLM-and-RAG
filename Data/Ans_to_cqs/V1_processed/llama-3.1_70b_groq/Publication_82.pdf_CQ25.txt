The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the model is being used for classification tasks. The context mentions that the model produces a distribution of values across 38 classes, which can be interpreted as the confidences of the network that a given input image is represented by the corresponding classes. This suggests that the model is being used for multi-class classification, where the goal is to assign an input image to one of the 38 classes.
