Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context appears to be a research paper on using hybrid deep learning models for algal blooms forecasting from satellite data in the Zhoushan fishery. It discusses the adjustment process of the solver for training the network and the input time series length for all deep learning models, as well as the structure and hyperparameters of the models. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training in this study.
