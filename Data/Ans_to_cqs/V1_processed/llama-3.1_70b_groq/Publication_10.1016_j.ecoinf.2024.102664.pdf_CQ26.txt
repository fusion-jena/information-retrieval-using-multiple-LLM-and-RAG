Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of various deep learning models for algal bloom forecasting, including CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models. It discusses the results of these models, their strengths and weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement.

However, it does mention the use of numerical model data integration into deep learning models to improve future forecasts, which might imply some form of data preprocessing or augmentation. Nevertheless, specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
