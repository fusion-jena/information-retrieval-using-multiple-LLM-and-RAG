The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on synthetic data and then tested on real MS point clouds, which suggests that the authors attempted to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained over 1000 epochs for each type of input data, and metrics such as Mean IoU (MIoU) were computed after each epoch to analyze the training performance. This suggests that the authors monitored the model's performance during training and selected the best-performing model based on the MIoU metric.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. It is also unclear whether the real MS point clouds used for testing were separate from the data used to create the ground truth, or whether they were part of the same dataset.

Therefore, while the authors appear to have taken some steps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, the context does not provide enough information to determine the full range of measures taken to ensure generalizability.
