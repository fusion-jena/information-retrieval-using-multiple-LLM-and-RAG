The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is for prediction and classification tasks, specifically for forecasting the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton. The model is also used for early diagnosis and classification of diseases in plants, such as sugar beet and cotton. Additionally, the model is employed for predicting other plant-related parameters, such as bark thickness and hypericin content.
