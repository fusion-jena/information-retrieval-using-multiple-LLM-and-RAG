Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that the model's performance was evaluated using conventional metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve. However, it does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used during training.

The text does mention that the model was trained for a fixed number of epochs (100), but it does not indicate whether the training process was stopped based on a specific validation loss threshold or plateau. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.
