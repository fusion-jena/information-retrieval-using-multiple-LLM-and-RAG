The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is classification. According to the provided context, the CNN is used for urban ecoacoustic assessment, and its task is to classify different classes in datasets without being specified a priori. The model is trained on annotated data and can choose the features that discriminate different classes in the dataset. The classification performance of the CNN is optimized during the training process.
