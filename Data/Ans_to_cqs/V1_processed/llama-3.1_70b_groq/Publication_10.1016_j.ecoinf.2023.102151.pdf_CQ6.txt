Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on digital soil mapping, soil moisture estimation, irrigation management, and node-based programming, but it does not provide specific information on deep learning model preprocessing.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. These steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model stability and convergence.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing or imputing missing values, and removing outliers or noisy data.

It's worth noting that the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture. If you're looking for specific guidance on preprocessing for a deep learning model, I recommend consulting a relevant textbook or research paper on the topic.

In the provided context, there is no explicit mention of deep learning model preprocessing. If you're looking for information on preprocessing steps for a specific task or dataset, I recommend consulting a relevant resource or expert in that area.
