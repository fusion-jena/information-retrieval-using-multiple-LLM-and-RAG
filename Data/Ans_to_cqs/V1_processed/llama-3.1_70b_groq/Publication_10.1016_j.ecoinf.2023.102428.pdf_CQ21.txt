Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the research design, data processing, and model description, specifically the MLPnn-MC modelling approach. It provides details on the MLP parameters and performance, but it does not delve into the postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention "Accuracy Rate" and "Skill measure (%)" in Table 7, which suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is performed. Additionally, the context mentions "Accuracy assessment" in section 2.4, but it does not provide further details on the specific postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query, and I do not want to make any assumptions or provide incomplete information. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
