Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning, model performance evaluation, and data splitting approaches for training and testing machine learning models. It does not provide information on data preprocessing steps.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a grid search to optimize hyperparameters, early stopping to prevent overfitting, and data splitting approaches to evaluate model performance. But it does not provide any details on data preprocessing steps that may have been performed before training the models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query regarding preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
