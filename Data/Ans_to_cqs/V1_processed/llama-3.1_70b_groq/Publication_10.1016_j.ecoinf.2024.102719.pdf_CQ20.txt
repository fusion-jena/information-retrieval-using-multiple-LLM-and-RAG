Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the machine learning models and algorithms used, such as CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and random forest, as well as the bias-variance decomposition and ensemble methods. It does not provide information on the hardware resources utilized for training the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
