The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision (P), recall (R), mean average precision (mAP), and the F1-score metrics. These metrics are calculated using specific equations. Precision gives the ratio of true predictions to the total number of predictions, while recall is the ratio of true predictions to the total number of objects present in the image. The F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, gives the model's test accuracy. Additionally, mean average precision (mAP) is also used as a measure of accuracy for the machine learning algorithm.
