The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the ratio used to split the data into training and testing sets. For both data sets (SSLs' data set and elephants' data set), the data was split into training and testing images with a ratio of 80:20, respectively. This means that 80% of the data was used for training, and 20% was used for testing. There is no mention of a separate validation set or the criteria used to split the data.
