The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and loss. According to the provided context, the evaluation of model performance was based on the accuracy metric, and each model underwent training for 10 epochs. The accuracy is calculated using the formula: Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN), where TP represents the number of true positive predictions, TN corresponds to the number of true negative predictions, FP signifies the number of false positive predictions, and FN indicates the number of false negative predictions.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance is also evaluated using the binary cross-entropy loss metric. The loss values are reported for each model in Table 2, which compares the performance metrics of different models.

There is no mention of precision and recall metrics in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm if these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
