I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and mechanisms of a deep learning model, specifically a Transformer-based model, and its application to predicting multivariate marine chemical data. It discusses the self-attention mechanism, multiscale attention, and attention fusion, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
