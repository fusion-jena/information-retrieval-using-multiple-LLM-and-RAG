The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that users should "anticipate iteratively training models with different sized training datasets and parameters until suitable performance is achieved." This suggests that the determination of when training is complete may be based on achieving a certain level of performance, but the exact criteria are not specified.
