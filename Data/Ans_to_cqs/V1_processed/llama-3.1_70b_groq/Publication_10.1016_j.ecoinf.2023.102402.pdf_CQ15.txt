I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, species distribution modeling, and conservation biology, with references to Maxent models, AICc values, and goodness-of-fit. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
