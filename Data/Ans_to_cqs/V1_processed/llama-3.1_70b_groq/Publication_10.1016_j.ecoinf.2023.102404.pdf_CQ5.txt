Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and geospatial applications, with references to various studies and papers related to forest classification, biomass estimation, and land cover mapping using satellite and airborne data.

The context mentions the use of datasets such as GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) and ICESat-2 data, as well as Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. However, these datasets are specific to remote sensing applications and are not typically used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
