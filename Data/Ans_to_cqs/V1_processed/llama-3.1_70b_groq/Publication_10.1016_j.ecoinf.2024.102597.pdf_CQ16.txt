Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of different machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, GBDT, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, for estimating water quality parameters (WQP) like Chla concentration and turbidity. It discusses the use of hyperparameter optimization methods like random grid search and Bayesian optimization but does not delve into the specifics of training completion criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this context.
