Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a research study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, it does provide information on the MLP model's parameters and performance, such as the number of input layer neurons, hidden layer nodes, output layer neurons, and training and testing RMS values. It also mentions the use of a sigmoid activation function and the Markov chain, but it does not discuss data splitting.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this study.
