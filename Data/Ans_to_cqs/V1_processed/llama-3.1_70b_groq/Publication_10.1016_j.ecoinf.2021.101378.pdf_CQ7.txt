Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning algorithms, such as random forest and maximum entropy modeling, to predict the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease in South Korea. It does not provide information on the data splitting process for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
