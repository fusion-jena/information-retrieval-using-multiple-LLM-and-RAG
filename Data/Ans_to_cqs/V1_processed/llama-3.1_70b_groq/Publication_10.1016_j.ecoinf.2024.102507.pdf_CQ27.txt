Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the data preparation, model building, training, and testing processes. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.

However, it does mention the use of Keras to build the model and TensorFlow as the underlying framework. It also mentions the use of Python packages or modules in each step of the process, as illustrated in the figure mentioned in the context. But it does not provide any details on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
