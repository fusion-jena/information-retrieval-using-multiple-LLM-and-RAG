The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the "number and spatial distribution of the samples, and influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms" are essential parameters that should be noticed in future studies to create a representative dataset and make a ML-based model with acceptable generalization.

It can be inferred that the authors consider the importance of having a diverse and representative dataset for training and testing the model. However, the context does not provide specific details on whether cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques were used to ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
