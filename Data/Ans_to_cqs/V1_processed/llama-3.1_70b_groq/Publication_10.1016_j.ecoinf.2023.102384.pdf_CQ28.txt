I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and academic articles related to deep learning, object detection, and agriculture, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
