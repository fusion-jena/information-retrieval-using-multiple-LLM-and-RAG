The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model is trained on patches of size 15 Ã— 15 pixels, where a patch is only considered for training if the center pixel is forested. This suggests that the model is using a form of pixel-level annotation, where each pixel is labeled as either forested or not.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model uses a Norway-wide timber volume map as an additional precautionary measure to avoid unnecessary noise from non-forested areas. This suggests that the model may be using a form of semantic segmentation, where pixels are labeled as either forested or not, based on the presence of vegetation points and the timber volume map.

However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if other data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are used in the pipeline.
