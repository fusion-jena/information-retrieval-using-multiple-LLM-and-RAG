I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting. The context appears to be related to a research paper on carbon emissions, energy consumption, and ecological development, and does not provide any information on deep learning or machine learning techniques. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
