Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model's architecture, training process, and optimization techniques, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the use of dropout technology to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model, which is a technique used during training. Additionally, it mentions the use of structural re-parameterization techniques to decouple the training structure from the inference structure, which enables independent optimization of the training and reasoning stages.

But, it does not provide any information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
