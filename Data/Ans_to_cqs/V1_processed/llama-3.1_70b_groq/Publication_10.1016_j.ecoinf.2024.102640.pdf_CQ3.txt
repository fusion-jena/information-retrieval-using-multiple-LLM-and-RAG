The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the proposed dataset, UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset), is used to train the GVI-learning model, and that it is designed to facilitate GVI extraction.

It also mentions that the dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks, which implies that the annotation technique used is likely to be pixel-level annotation or instance segmentation. This is because semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, which requires pixel-level annotation.

Additionally, the context mentions that the SegFormer model, which is used for GVI learning, follows the encoder-decoder structure and is a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation. This suggests that the annotation technique used is likely to be instance segmentation, as SegFormer is designed for semantic segmentation tasks.

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to say for certain what data annotation techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline.
