The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Accuracy
2. Sensitivity
3. Specificity
4. Precision
5. F1-score

These metrics are listed in Table 2, which presents the average evaluation measures over ten independent executions for the four different methods. The table highlights the best result for each metric in bold.
