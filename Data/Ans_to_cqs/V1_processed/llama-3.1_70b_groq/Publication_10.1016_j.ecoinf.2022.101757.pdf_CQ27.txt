Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only mentions that the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset, and that the model was used for inference on landscape photos without being trained directly on them. It does not provide information on how the model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
