Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of high-level image classifiers to filter out non-plant images, the use of keyword searches to gather data, and the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the Pl@ntNet dataset. It does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used.
