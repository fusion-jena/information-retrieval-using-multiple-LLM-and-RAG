The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was fine-tuned on a specific dataset called "Darksound" and its performance was evaluated using metrics such as DBCV, ARI, and AMI scores. 

The context also mentions that the CNN backbones used in the experiment were previously trained on the ImageNet database, which is a large and general dataset. However, it is noted that using features extracted from models trained on smaller but more specific datasets, such as bird sound datasets, could lead to higher quality classification. 

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. The context only discusses the performance of the model on the Darksound dataset and the energy consumption of training the model on different tasks. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
