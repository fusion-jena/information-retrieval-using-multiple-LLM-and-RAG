The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that data augmentation is used to estimate ÏƒARU by adding a number of known 'non-detections' with distance of NA to the dataset of detected or simulated calls. This suggests that the data augmentation technique used is adding artificial non-detections to the dataset, but it does not provide information on other techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
