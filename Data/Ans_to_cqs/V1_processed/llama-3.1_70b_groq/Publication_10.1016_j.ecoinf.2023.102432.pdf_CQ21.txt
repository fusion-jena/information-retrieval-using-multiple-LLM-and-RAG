The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the calculation of certain metrics and the creation of confusion matrices.

According to the context, the confusion matrix was calculated using the 20% of the data not used for training the algorithm (approximately 720 pixels with 50 having Brazilian peppertree present). The overall, producer, and user accuracy are also reported.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of metrics such as overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. However, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps like saliency maps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training appear to be limited to the calculation of metrics (overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy) and the creation of confusion matrices.
