I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions a study on the use of the BirdNET app, which is powered by machine learning, but it does not provide information on where the code for the pipeline is hosted. The context also mentions a paper by Wood et al. (2022) that discusses the development of machine-learning algorithms for bird species identification, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
