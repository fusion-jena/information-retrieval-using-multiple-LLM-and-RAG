I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that deep learning models were used to classify three sympatric otter species, but it does not provide further details on the architecture of the models. The context also mentions the use of machine learning-based methods for missing value imputation, but it does not specify the type of model used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
