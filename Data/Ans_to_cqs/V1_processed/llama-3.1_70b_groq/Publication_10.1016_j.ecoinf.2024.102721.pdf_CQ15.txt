Bayesian optimization.

According to the provided context, specifically section 2.3.4, Bayesian optimization is mentioned as an optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not provide information on other optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. Therefore, I can only confirm the use of Bayesian optimization, but I do not know if other techniques like SGD or Adam are used.
