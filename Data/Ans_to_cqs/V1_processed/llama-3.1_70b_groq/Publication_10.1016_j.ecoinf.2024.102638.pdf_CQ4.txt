Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to machine learning and deep learning applications in earth system science, but it does not specifically discuss data augmentation techniques.

The context includes a list of machine learning algorithms (KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, MLP) and their hyperparameters, as well as references to research papers on topics such as evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and eddy covariance. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
