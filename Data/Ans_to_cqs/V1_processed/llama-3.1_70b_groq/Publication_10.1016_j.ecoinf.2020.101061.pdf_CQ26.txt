The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation of random flips and translations, which was tested and found to have little effect on the final score. This suggests that some form of data augmentation was explored, but it is not clear if it was used to address data bias specifically.

Additionally, the context mentions that the pretraining data is generated using a LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm, which is then used to pretrain a deep learning neural network. The network is then retrained using hand-annotated data. This suggests that the pipeline may be using a form of transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset. However, it is not clear if this is used to address data bias.

The context also mentions that the dataset is split into training, evaluation, and pretraining sets, but it does not provide information on how the data is split or if any techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query. However, it can be said that data augmentation was explored, and transfer learning is used in the pipeline.
