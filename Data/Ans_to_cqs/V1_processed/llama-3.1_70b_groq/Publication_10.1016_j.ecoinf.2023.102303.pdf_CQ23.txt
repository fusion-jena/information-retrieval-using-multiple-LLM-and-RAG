Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of semi-supervised and weakly-supervised models with fully-supervised models, and the description of the proposed models, such as EfficientNet. 

However, it does mention the use of the "FishInTurbidWater dataset" which suggests that the model was trained and tested on a specific dataset. But it does not provide information on whether the dataset was diverse, or if techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.
