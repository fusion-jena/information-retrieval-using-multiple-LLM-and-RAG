Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the proposed models, including the 3D GAN network, U-Net discriminator, feature extractor CNN network, and Swin Transformer classifier. It also discusses the performance of these models on a wetland mapping task, but does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
