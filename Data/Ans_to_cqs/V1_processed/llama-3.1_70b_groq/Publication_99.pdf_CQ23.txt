The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the dataset was balanced, which suggests that the dataset may have been curated to ensure that it is representative of the problem being solved.

Additionally, the context mentions that the models were trained with various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes. This suggests that the models were trained on a diverse set of images, which can help improve their generalizability.

The context also mentions that the models were evaluated using a validation set, and the best model was saved based on the validation loss. This suggests that some form of cross-validation was used to evaluate the models, but it is not clear if it was stratified splitting or k-fold cross-validation.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the measures taken to ensure generalizability, it does not provide a complete picture. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
