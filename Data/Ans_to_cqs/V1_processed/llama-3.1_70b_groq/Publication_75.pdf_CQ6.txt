Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, SeedNet. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the SeedNet model, the experimental setup, and the results of the classification and retrieval tasks.

However, it does mention that the input image size is 224 × 224 × 3, which suggests that the images may have been resized to a uniform size before being fed into the model. But it does not provide any information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the SeedNet model.
