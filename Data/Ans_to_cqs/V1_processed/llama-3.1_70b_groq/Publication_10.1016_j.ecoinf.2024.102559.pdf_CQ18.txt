The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on the tables and data provided, it appears that the model performance is being evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and confusion matrices. These metrics are commonly used to assess the performance of classification models, particularly in remote sensing and land cover classification applications. It is likely that the model performance is being monitored using these metrics during training, but the specific strategy or approach is not explicitly stated.
