Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific purpose of the deep learning models (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) in the context of landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM). However, it does mention that the authors plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in the future.

Based on the general knowledge of deep learning models, CNNs are commonly used for image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks, while RCNNs are typically used for object detection tasks. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of these models in the context of LSM.

Therefore, I can only provide a general answer that the purpose of the deep learning models in this context is likely related to tasks such as classification, object detection, or segmentation, but the exact purpose is not specified in the provided context.
