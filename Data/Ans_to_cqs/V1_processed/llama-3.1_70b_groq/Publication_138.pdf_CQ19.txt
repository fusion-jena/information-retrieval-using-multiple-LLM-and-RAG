Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models (e.g., LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ICSNet, VGG-19, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-152). The context only provides information about the architecture and performance of these models, but does not mention the frameworks used to implement them.
