Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning methods for forecasting ecological water demand in an arid oasis, and discusses various aspects of the methodology, including data-driven machine learning models, LSTM models, and data preprocessing techniques such as the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
