Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for understanding groundwater-climate interactions, rather than delving into the specifics of the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
