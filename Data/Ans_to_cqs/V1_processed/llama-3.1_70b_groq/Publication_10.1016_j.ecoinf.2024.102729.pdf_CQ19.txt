Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions the application of deep learning in water quality management and the use of various machine learning techniques such as Random Forest and Generalized Additive models, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
