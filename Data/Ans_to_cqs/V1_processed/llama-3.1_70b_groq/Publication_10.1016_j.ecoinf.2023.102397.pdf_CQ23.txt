Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context mentions the work of Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) on the effect of sample size on deep neural networks, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset with multiple recordings, as the context mentions the analysis of the target set and the comparison of the software programs. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a training set and a target set, which suggests that some form of splitting or partitioning of the data was performed.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting.
