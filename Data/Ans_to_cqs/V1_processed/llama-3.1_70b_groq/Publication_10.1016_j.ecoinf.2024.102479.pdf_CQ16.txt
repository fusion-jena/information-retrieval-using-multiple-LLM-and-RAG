The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It discusses the use of Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) to identify the most effective set of hyperparameters for a model, and the employment of k-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of the models. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training.

The context does mention that the process of GSCV concludes with the selection of the model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by its optimal hyperparameter combination. However, it does not specify how the training process is terminated or what criteria are used to determine when the optimal hyperparameters have been found.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
