Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to focus on the architecture and components of the encoder and decoder, as well as some references to related research papers. There is no mention of data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

However, it does mention "acoustic surveys" in a passing reference, suggesting that the data may be related to audio or acoustic signals. Additionally, it mentions an appendix B that contains a link to a data repository, which might provide more information on the data collection methods. Unfortunately, this information is not available in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the question.
