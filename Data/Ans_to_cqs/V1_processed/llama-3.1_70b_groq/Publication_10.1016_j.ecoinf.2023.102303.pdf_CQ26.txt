Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development of a semi-supervised contrastive learning approach and a weakly-supervised model for underwater fish video processing in turbid waters. It discusses the collection and labeling of the FishInTurbidWater dataset, the proposed model architecture, and the results of the experiments.

However, it does mention that the authors used a weakly labeled dataset, which might imply that they did not use techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias. Instead, they relied on the contrastive learning approach to learn from the weakly labeled data.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the collection of a diverse dataset (FishInTurbidWater) in turbid waters, which might help to reduce data bias. However, it does not provide explicit information on how the data was collected to ensure diversity.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the query about the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
