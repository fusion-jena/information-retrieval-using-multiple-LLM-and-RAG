The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the dataset should be enhanced to generate more data and solve the overfitting issue, which suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of having a robust dataset for training the model. Additionally, the text mentions that the model was trained on two types of data, but it does not provide further details on the diversity of the dataset or the splitting strategy used. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
