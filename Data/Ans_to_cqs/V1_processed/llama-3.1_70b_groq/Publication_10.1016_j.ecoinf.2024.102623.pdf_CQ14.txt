Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that different species within the same region may have different optimal values for the hyperparameter λ2, and that setting distinct λ2 values per species could improve model performance. However, it does not provide information on the optimization method used to find these optimal values.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
