The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses image data, specifically satellite imagery, as input for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. This is evident from the mention of "satellite imagery" and "high-resolution remote sensing images" in the context.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of spectral features and indices, such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), which are commonly used in remote sensing and LULC classification. This suggests that the pipeline may also use data formats related to remote sensing and geospatial analysis.

However, it is not possible to determine with certainty the specific data formats used in the pipeline, such as CSV, audio, or video, as this information is not provided in the context.
