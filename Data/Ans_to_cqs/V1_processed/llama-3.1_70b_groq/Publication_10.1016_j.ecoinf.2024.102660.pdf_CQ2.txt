The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. Specifically, the study uses UAV water images to train and test the Res_AUNet network for water sun glint detection. The images are cropped to a size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, resulting in a total of 1764 image pairs. These image pairs are then used for training, validating, and testing the network. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
