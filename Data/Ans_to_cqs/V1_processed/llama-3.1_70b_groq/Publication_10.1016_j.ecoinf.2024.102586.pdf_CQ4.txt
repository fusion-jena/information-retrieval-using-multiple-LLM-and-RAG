I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of academic references related to ecology, climate change, and invasive species, with no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques. The references seem to focus on topics such as climate change, plant invasions, and species management, and do not provide any information on data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
