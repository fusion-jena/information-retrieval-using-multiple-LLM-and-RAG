The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the deep learning model is being used for water quality management and prediction tasks.

In the paper "Applications of deep learning in water quality management: A state-of-the-art review" by Wai et al. (2022), the authors discuss the use of deep learning techniques for water quality prediction, classification, and regression tasks. They mention that deep learning models can be used for tasks such as predicting water quality parameters, classifying water quality status, and detecting anomalies in water quality data.

In another paper, "Prediction model of the outflow temperature from stratified reservoir regulated by stratified water intake facility based on machine learning algorithm" by Lu et al. (2023), the authors use a machine learning algorithm to predict the outflow temperature from a stratified reservoir. This suggests that the deep learning model may be used for regression tasks, such as predicting continuous values.

Overall, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated, it appears to be used for tasks related to water quality management and prediction.
