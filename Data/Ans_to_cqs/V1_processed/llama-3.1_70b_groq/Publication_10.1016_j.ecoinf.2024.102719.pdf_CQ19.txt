Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions various machine learning models and algorithms, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression (LR), na√Øve Bayes (NB), CatBoost (CAT), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), LightGBM (LGB), and others, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models.

However, it does mention that the CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost packages were used, along with the Hyperopt package for hyperparameter tuning. But it does not explicitly mention the deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
