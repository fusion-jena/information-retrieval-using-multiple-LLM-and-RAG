The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model's fit to the observed data is assessed using the R2 metric, and that the model achieves an R2 of 0.95 after training. This suggests that the training process may be stopped when the model's performance on the training data reaches a certain threshold, but the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.
