Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning methods in ecology and forest management, specifically in predicting the occurrence of pine wilt disease in South Korea. It discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, including random forest and Maxent models, but does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a relevant answer to this query.
