The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the best model was determined by comparing the MSE and R values for different numbers of neurons in the ANN system. This suggests that the number of hidden layer neurons was optimized through a process of trial and error or manual tuning, but the exact method used is not specified. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other specific hyperparameter optimization technique.
