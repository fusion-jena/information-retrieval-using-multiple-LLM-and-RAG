The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the authors "utilized the recommended parameters for all MLMs, except for Random Forest (RF), where we expressly set the number of trees to 500 as an additional parameter." This suggests that the authors may have used a simple approach to set the hyperparameters, such as using default or recommended values, rather than a more systematic approach like grid search or random search. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer.
