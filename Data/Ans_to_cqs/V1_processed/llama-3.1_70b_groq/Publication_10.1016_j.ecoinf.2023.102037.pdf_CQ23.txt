To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the researchers took several measures. Firstly, they split their data on the sticky plate level, meaning that individual insects that belonged to the same sticky plate image were kept together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). This approach allowed them to validate their model's performance by emulating the way it would be used in practice, i.e., predicting a class for any given object it detected on unseen sticky plate images.

Additionally, the researchers used a technique called "Slicing Aided Hyper Inference" (SAHI) to apply the YOLOv5 model on sticky plate images. They also used image tiling, where they divided the images into regions of interest of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) that contained the maximum number of complete bounding boxes.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether they used cross-validation or stratified splitting. The researchers do mention that they took into consideration the limitations of weak validation procedures, such as random data splitting, which they had previously shown to highly overestimate model performance.
