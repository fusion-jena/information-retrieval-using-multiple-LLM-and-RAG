Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on the results of classification and regression tasks, specifically the performance metrics of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

However, based on the information provided in Table 2, it can be inferred that some metrics calculation was performed as part of the evaluation process. The table reports various performance metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), and Accuracy (Acc %) for each task.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, which provides tools for calculating various metrics and visualizing results, including saliency maps and confusion matrices. However, there is no explicit mention of these specific postprocessing steps being performed in this context.

Therefore, while some metrics calculation was likely performed, the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps and confusion matrices, are not specified in the provided context.
