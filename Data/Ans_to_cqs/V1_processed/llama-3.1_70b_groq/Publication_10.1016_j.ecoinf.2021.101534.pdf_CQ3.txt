Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses data augmentation techniques, spectrogram conversion, and model training, but does not delve into data annotation methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
