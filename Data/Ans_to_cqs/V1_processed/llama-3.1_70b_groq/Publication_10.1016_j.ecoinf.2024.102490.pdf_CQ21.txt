The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the authors used two metrics to evaluate the accuracy of their models: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS).

It can be inferred that the authors calculated these metrics as part of their postprocessing steps, but the context does not provide further details on other postprocessing steps that may have been involved. Therefore, I can only confirm that metrics calculation (specifically AUC and TSS) was part of the postprocessing steps, but I do not know about other potential steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix.
