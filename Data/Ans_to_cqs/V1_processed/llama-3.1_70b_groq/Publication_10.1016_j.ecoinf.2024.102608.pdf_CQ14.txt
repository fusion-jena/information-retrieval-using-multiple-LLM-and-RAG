The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a randomized grid search method. This approach involves randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore, rather than exhaustively searching through all possible combinations of hyperparameters. This method is used to strike a balance between model complexity and the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting. The optimal hyperparameter values for each machine learning model are determined using this randomized grid search technique, which has been shown to be a powerful optimization technique that can find equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, particularly when some hyperparameters are more influential than others.
