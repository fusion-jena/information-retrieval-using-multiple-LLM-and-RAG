The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) mentioned in the context, is to learn to map high-dimensional input data to usually low-dimensional output that is suitable for the target output. In other words, the purpose of the CNN is to classify images by extracting numerical features from the input images and mapping them to a lower-dimensional output that represents the class or category of the image.

The context does not explicitly mention segmentation or detection as the purpose of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the CNN is used for image analysis, which suggests that the model is used for tasks such as image classification, object recognition, or image recognition.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of pre-trained networks, such as ResNet and InceptionV3, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Therefore, based on the context, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is image classification.
