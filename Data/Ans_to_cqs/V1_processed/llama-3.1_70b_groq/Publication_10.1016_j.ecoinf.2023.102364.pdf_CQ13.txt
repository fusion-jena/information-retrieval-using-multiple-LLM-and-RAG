I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text mentions the use of machine learning ensembles and various algorithms such as RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in these models. Additionally, the text does not mention the use of deep learning models at all. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
