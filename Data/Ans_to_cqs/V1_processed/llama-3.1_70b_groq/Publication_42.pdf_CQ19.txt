The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions various architectures such as ResNetV50, InceptionNetV3, EfÔ¨ÅcientNetB0, and DenceNet121, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these architectures. It also mentions the use of R for statistical computing, but this is not related to the deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
