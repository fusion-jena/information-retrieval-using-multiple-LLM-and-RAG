The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to various applications such as image caption generation, gesture recognition, and video prediction, it can be inferred that the data formats used may include image and video data. Additionally, the mention of satellite-derived climatic and vegetation indices in the paper by Zhang et al. (2021) suggests that CSV or other tabular data formats may also be used. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
