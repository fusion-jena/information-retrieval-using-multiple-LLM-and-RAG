The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, but rather a Random Forest (RF) model. However, it does mention some measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the RF model.

According to the context, the training samples were randomly divided into training and test datasets in a proportion of 80% and 20%, respectively. This suggests that the model was trained on a large portion of the data and tested on a smaller portion, which can help to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the context mentions that a grid search method (GridSearchCV) was used with five-fold cross-validation to search for the optimal parameters of the model. This suggests that the model was trained and evaluated on multiple folds of the data, which can help to ensure that the results are not due to chance and can be generalized to new data.

However, the context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting. It does mention that the selected training samples lacked low-value LAI samples, which could affect the model's ability to predict low-value LAI accurately.
