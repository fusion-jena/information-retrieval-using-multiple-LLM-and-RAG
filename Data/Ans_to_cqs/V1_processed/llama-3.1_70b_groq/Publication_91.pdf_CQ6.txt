The provided context does not explicitly mention all the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention a few preprocessing steps that were applied to the training set. 

The images in the training set were centre cropped to an equally sized rectangle. Additionally, the images were augmented in the following ways: 
- Flipped horizontally
- Flipped vertically
- Adjusted in brightness (± 12.5%)
- Adjusted in saturation (± 50.0%)
- Adjusted by contrast (± 12.5%)
- Adjusted in hue (± 20%)

It is not mentioned whether any normalization or scaling was applied to the images. The context also does not mention any cleaning steps that were taken.
