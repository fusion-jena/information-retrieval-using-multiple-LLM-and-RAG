Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the hybrid model, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and its application to drought propagation time prediction. It mentions the improvement in prediction accuracy after embedding LSTM into the CNN, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
