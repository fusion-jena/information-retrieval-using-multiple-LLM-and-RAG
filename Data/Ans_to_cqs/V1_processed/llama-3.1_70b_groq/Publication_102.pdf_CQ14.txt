The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 is used to optimize the model's parameters. Additionally, it mentions that the early stopping technique is applied to avoid over-fitting, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are tuned. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
