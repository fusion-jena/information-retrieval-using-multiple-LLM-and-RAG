The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some strategies that can be used to improve classification accuracy and deal with characteristics of the geometry of the training data.

According to the context, some strategies that can be used to improve classification accuracy include:

* Training data augmentation to enhance generalization capabilities
* Post-classification techniques such as segmentation and filtering to reduce salt-and-pepper errors
* Dealing with the characteristics of the geometry of the training data by excluding outliers, refining training samples, or changing the proportion of training and test data

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) as a variable selection method to determine the most important variables and improve overall accuracy.

However, the context does not specifically mention techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I do not know if these techniques are used in this specific context.
