Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily discusses the BirdNET project, its capabilities, and its application in identifying bird species, but it does not delve into the details of the data splitting process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
