Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to focus more on the processing and evaluation of the data, particularly in the context of image classification and ecological surveys. However, it does mention the use of hyperspectral remote sensing for tracking plant invasions, which suggests that remote sensing technologies may be involved in data collection. Additionally, it references a paper on "Accelerating image-based ecological surveys with interactive machine learning," which implies that image-based data collection methods may be used. Unfortunately, without more information, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer.
