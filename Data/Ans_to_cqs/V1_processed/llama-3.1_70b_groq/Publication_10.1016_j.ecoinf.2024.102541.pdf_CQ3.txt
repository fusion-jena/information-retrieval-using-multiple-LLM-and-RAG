The provided context mentions several data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This is evident from the mention of "bounding boxes" in the context, which refers to the rectangular boxes drawn around objects of interest in an image.
2. Instance segmentation: This is mentioned in the context as "instance maps" and "mask maps", which indicate the location and segmentation of individual objects within the image.
3. Label annotation: The context mentions "label maps", which categorize objects with distinct colors that match their bounding boxes.
4. Heatmap annotation: The context mentions "heatmap overlaying the input image", where brighter pixels signify higher network confidence in object detection.

These annotation techniques are used to provide comprehensive insights into the dataset's structure and diversity, and to train deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and object detection models like YOLOv5.

It's worth noting that the context also mentions the use of ground-truth annotations, which suggests that the annotations are manually created by humans to provide accurate labels for the data.
