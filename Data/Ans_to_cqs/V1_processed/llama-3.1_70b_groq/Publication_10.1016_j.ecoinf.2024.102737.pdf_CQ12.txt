The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Siamese network, which is a type of neural network architecture that is particularly well-suited for learning with a small example set. Specifically, the pipeline uses two Siamese architectures with either 2 or 4 convolution layers with Relu activations and Contrastive Loss (CoL) as a loss function. Additionally, the text mentions that a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used in a separate study, but it is not clear if this is part of the same pipeline.
