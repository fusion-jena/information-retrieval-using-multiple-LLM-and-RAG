Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on presenting the results of the model's performance on a specific task, such as classifying iceplant and other vegetation, across different window sizes and feature sets.

However, it can be inferred that the model was evaluated on a dataset with varying window sizes, which might suggest that the model was tested on different subsets of the data. Additionally, the presence of accuracy metrics such as Overall Accuracy, Producer's Accuracy, and User's Accuracy across different window sizes might indicate that some form of evaluation or validation was performed.

But without explicit information on the use of techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the diversity of the dataset, it is difficult to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
