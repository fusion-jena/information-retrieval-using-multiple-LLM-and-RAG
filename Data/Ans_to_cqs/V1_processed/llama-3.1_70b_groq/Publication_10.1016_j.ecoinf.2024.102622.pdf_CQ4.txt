Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, vegetation indices, and hyperspectral imaging, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, I can suggest that common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

* Flipping (horizontal and/or vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (up or down)
* Cropping
* Color jittering
* Noise injection
* etc.

But I couldn't find any specific information on data augmentation techniques in the provided context. If you have any further questions or need more information, please let me know.
