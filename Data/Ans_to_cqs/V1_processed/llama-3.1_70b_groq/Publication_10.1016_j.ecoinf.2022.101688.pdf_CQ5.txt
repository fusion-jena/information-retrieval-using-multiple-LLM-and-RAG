The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

1. ImageNet: This is a large-scale image recognition dataset that was used to pre-train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used in the study.
2. Birdsongs dataset: This dataset was used to fine-tune the pre-trained CNNs for the specific task of classifying birdsong calls.
3. Hainan gibbon dataset: This dataset was used as one of the bioacoustic datasets to test the performance of the CNNs.
4. Whydah dataset: This dataset was also used as one of the bioacoustic datasets to test the performance of the CNNs.

Note that the context does not mention MNIST or CIFAR datasets, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
