The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the accuracy assessment of the developed model was performed using the 'yardstick' package for R, specifically the 'metrics' function, which calculated three selected model parameters: RMSE, MAE, and R2. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated using these metrics, but the specific strategy or approach used to monitor the model performance during training is not described.
