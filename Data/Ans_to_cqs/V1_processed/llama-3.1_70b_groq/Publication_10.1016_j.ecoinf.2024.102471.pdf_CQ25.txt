The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to classify bird species based on their calls. The model processes audio data to detect subtle differences between bird calls and identify the species. The model can be trained on a wide variety of audio data, allowing it to identify even rare ecological moments of bird species. The classification layer with sigmoid activation function is used to decide on bird categories as output.
