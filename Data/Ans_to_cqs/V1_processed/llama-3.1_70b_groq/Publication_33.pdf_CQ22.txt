The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. It mentions that the proposed post-processing was able to decrease the misclassification rate and increase the accuracy of the model. 

However, it does mention that the calibration of the model consists of a matching between the score predicted by the machine-learning model and the real probability of true positives, which suggests that the model's performance is also being evaluated in terms of true positives. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the unsure classification rate was higher after switching T1 and T2 roles, which implies that the model's performance is also being evaluated in terms of correct classification and misclassification rates. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model appear to be accuracy, misclassification rate, and true positives. However, it is not clear if other metrics such as precision and recall are also being used.
