The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on a systematic approach where samples were collected following a grid of sample blocks of 9 by 9 km with 15 km spacing between blocks. The blocks were assigned as training, validation, and test. 

For the test sample, a column of the sample grid was randomly selected and every fourth column from that added. Only every second row for the selected columns were included in the test sample. 

The distribution of the sample sets is as follows: 
- 39,520 (60%) training samples
- 23,934 (30%) verification samples
- 6,509 (10%) test samples

This approach was used to maximize model performance by focusing the majority of the samples for training and verification.
