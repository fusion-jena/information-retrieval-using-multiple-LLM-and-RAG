Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the processing and analysis of whale sound recordings, specifically discussing data denoising, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
