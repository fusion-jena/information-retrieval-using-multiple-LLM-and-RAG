Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the bounding boxes in the training dataset are within a certain size, suggesting that some form of bounding box annotation may have been used. Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset contains full-resolution images and cropped images of insects, which may imply some form of image preprocessing or annotation. Nevertheless, the specific annotation techniques used are not clearly stated in the provided context.
