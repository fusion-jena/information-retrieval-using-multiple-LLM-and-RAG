I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of the EWT-DSE multiscale method for drought monitoring in the Urmia Lake basin, and the application of the HYSPLIT model to assess changes in dust sources. The context includes mathematical equations and references to various studies, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.
