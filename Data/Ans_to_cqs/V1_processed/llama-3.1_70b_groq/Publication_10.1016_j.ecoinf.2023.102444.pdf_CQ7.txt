Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the use of dimensionality reduction methods (DRM) such as UMAP and tSNE, and mentions the application of clustering to identify groups containing species and near background points. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

The only mention of deep learning models is in the context of Deneu et al. (2022) using a convolutional neural network to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution, but it does not provide details on the data splitting criteria used in that study.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
