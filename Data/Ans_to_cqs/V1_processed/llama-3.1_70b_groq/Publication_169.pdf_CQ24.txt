The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that "A random search was performed over fourth- and fifth-layer models of the leaf features positions." This suggests that the authors used a random search to explore different models, but it does not provide information on how they handled randomness in the pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained with a learning rate that was dropped by a factor of 10 after every 60 epochs, and that the initial hyperparameter training rate was set to 0.001. This suggests that the authors used a learning rate schedule to control the training process, but it does not provide information on how they handled randomness.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the query about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
