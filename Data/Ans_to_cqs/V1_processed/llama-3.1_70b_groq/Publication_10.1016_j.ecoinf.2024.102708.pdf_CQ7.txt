The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is to allocate 70% of the tiles containing Pacific oysters for training and 30% for validation. This split is applied to the tiles containing Pacific oysters, while the tiles without Pacific oysters are not mentioned to have undergone a specific split. Additionally, data augmentation is used to increase the size of the training dataset, where five augmented images are created per original tile, resulting in an additional 5735 tiles split between the two sites.
