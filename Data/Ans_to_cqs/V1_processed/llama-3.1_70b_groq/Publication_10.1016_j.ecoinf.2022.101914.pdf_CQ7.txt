The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the data was split into five folds, with one fold set aside for external evaluation and the remaining four folds used for internal cross-validation during model training. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria used for the split are not specified. Additionally, the context does not mention the use of a test set, but rather an external evaluation set.
