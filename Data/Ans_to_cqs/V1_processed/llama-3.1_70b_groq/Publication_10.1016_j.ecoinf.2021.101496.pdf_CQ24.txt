Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on plant physiology, agriculture, and remote sensing, with some references to machine learning and data analysis. However, it does not specifically address the topic of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

One relevant mention is the use of a "training dataset" and a "testing dataset" in the context of modeling SPAD values, which suggests that the authors may have employed techniques such as data splitting or cross-validation to evaluate their models. However, this is not directly related to handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
