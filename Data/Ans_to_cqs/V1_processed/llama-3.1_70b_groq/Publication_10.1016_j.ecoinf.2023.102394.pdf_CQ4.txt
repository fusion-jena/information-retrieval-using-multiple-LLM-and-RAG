Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning techniques in ecological informatics, soil organic carbon prediction, and agriculture-related elements, but it does not delve into the specifics of data augmentation techniques used in these studies. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
