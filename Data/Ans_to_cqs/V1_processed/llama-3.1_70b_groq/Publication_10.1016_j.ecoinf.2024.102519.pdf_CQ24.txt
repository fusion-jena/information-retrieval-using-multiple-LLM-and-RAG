Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and its application in various fields, including ecological informatics and artificial intelligence. It mentions the use of GA in combination with other optimization algorithms and machine learning methods, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of random solutions, also known as a "population," in the GA optimization process. This suggests that randomness is an inherent part of the GA algorithm, and it is used to generate diverse solutions. Nevertheless, this information is not directly applicable to handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not offer any specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values.
