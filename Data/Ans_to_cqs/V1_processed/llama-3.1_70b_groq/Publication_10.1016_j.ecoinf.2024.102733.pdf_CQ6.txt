Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model, specifically the MLP, uses the following preprocessing steps:

1. **Batch Normalization**: This is applied to the third layer of the MLP, which helps to normalize the input data for each layer.
2. **Input scaling**: The input to the MLP is of size 512, which consists of learned features extracted from a diffusion model. However, the context does not provide explicit details on how the input data is scaled or normalized.
3. **Noise scaling**: The context mentions "noise scaling" as a parameter, but it is not clear how this is used as a preprocessing step.

Additionally, the context mentions that the decoder is composed of layers sized 3 × 128 and 6 × 64, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved in training this model.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention any explicit data cleaning or preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, outliers, or data augmentation. Therefore, it is unclear what specific preprocessing steps are involved before training the deep learning model.
