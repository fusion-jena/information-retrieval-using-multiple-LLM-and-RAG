According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

* Rotation
* Flipping (specifically, horizontal flipping)
* Cropping

These transformations were applied to the existing data samples to artificially increase the diversity of the dataset and help improve the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios and conditions. The specific choice of transformations was made considering the visual characteristics of plant species, as well as the typical properties of citizen-science and social media images.
