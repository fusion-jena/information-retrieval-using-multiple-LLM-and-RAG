The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the network is key to optimizing the parameters in the model using the reference dataset, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. It does mention that the batch size was set to 128, which suggests that some experimentation with hyperparameters was done, but the exact method used is not specified.
