Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing is Random Year (RY) splitting. This approach involves grouping individual observations according to year of capture and then randomly selecting years for inclusion in the train and test datasets. This method ensures that the model is tested using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables, making it a more robust test of model performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that the RY splitting approach may produce systematic differences between the test and train datasets, but it does not introduce any systematic differences between the datasets like other methods might.

There is no mention of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether these techniques are used in this specific deep learning pipeline.
