I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning models are characterized by artificial neural networks with multiple layers, allowing them to accommodate both structured and unstructured data. However, it does not provide information on the specific architecture of the deep learning model used, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context primarily focuses on comparing XGBoost with deep learning models in general, without providing details on the specific deep learning model used.
