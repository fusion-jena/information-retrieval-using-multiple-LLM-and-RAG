I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-based platform for processing big geospatial data, the collection and distribution of training and validation samples, and the analysis of the impact of different feature batches using the McNemars' test. However, it does not provide information about the code repository.
