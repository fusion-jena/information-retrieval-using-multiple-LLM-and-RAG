I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research paper on estimating soil organic carbon using Vis-nir spectral data and various machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
