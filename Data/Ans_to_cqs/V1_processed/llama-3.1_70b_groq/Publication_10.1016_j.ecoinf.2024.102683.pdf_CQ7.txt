The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned in section 2.4 that the data split for training and testing of the proposed models is reported in Table 1, but the table is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data.
