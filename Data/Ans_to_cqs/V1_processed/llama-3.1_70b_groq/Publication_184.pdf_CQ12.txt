The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a YOLOv3 model, which is a variant of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it uses a 53-layered CNN feature extractor called Darknet-53, which is a custom-designed CNN architecture that utilizes 3x3 and 1x1 convolutional layers and skip connections inspired from ResNet.
