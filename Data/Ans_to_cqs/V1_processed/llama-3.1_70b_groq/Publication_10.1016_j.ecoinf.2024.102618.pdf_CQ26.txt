To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the proposed approach uses a class-weighted technique to balance the dataset. This technique is used to counter the bias of deep learning models towards classes with a large number of images. The class-weighted technique is implemented in two steps: first, the compute_class_weights function from the sklearn library in Python is used to calculate the weights that should be given to each class depending on the class numbers. Then, these class weights are used as inputs to train the model by setting the class weight parameters using the previously calculated weights.

It is also mentioned that the data imbalance in the proposed dataset is small, which is why a simple algorithm like class-weighted is proposed. However, other techniques such as data augmentation are also used to increase the number of images from 55,448 to 61,486 images.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context. Diverse data collection is also not mentioned as a technique used in this specific approach.
