Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model's input, parameters, and output, as well as the data collection and classification process. It does not provide information on the evaluation or analysis of the model's performance after training.

However, it does mention that the model's performance was observed and the parameters were adjusted accordingly after the initial run. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was re-run 12 times until all the initial classified maps were reclassified, but it does not provide details on the evaluation metrics or postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
