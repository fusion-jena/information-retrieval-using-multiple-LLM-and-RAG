Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including the network architecture, training parameters, and results. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related details.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
