Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, experimental setup, and performance metrics. It does mention that the dataset is divided chronologically into training, validation, and test sets to prevent data snooping bias, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the context mentions that the input tensor comprises three dimensions: batch size, number of model variables, and future prediction length. This suggests that the data might have been formatted and possibly normalized or scaled to fit the model's input requirements. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this question.

Therefore, I can only say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
