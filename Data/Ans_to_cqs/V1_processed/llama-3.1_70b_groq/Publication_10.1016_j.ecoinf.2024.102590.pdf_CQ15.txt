I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only mentions that deep learning methods, specifically CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), will be used in the future to analyze aerial images of KNP (Kalahari National Park) taken every two years. However, it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
