The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the classification algorithm involves an element of randomness, such as random initialization of weights in Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) or random sampling during training.

To address the randomness, the context suggests that experiments are performed over different runs to help capture the variability introduced by these random factors. This implies that one strategy employed is to run the experiment multiple times with different random seeds or initializations, allowing the model to capture the variability and providing a more robust evaluation of its performance.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a V-algorithm, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in these specific models. 

In general, other strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines may include techniques such as:

* Using a fixed random seed for reproducibility
* Averaging model performance over multiple runs
* Using techniques such as dropout or batch normalization to reduce the impact of random initialization
* Using ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds

However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.
