Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the performance of a CNN model on a specific classification task, citing various research papers and techniques related to image processing and deep learning.

However, I can provide some general information on common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution
* Oversampling: increasing the number of instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the class distribution
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation of underrepresented classes

It's worth noting that the context mentions the use of a CNN model and cites research papers related to image processing and deep learning, but it does not provide specific information on data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.
