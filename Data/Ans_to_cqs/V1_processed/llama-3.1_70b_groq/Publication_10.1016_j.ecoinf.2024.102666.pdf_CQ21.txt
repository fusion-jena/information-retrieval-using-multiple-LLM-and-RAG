I don't know. The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms, remote sensing reflectance, and satellite imaging, specifically in the context of plateau lakes. It discusses the C2RCC processor and L2gen, but does not provide information on postprocessing steps after model training.
