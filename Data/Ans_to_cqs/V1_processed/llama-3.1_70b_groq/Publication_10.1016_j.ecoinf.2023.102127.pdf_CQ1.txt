Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to focus on the limitations and challenges of working with biodiversity datasets, particularly in the context of species distribution modeling (SDMs). It mentions the importance of having good availability and quality of data at adequate scales, but it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting this data.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The context does not mention surveys, sensors, public datasets, or any other methods for collecting raw data. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and help further.
