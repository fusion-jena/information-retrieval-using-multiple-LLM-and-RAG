I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It appears to be discussing a classification problem using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) algorithms, with input datasets consisting of various combinations of spectral bands, spectral indices, texture indices, and other variables.
