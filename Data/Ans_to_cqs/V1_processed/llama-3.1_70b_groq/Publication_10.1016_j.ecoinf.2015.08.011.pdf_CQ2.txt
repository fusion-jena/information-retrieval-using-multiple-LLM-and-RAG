Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the development and application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various fields, including ecology, biology, and environmental science. It discusses the selection of optimal parameters for ANNs, such as the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate, but does not provide information on the data formats used.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data used in the ANN models is likely to be in a tabular format, such as CSV, as the context mentions "measured data" and "model output" which suggests numerical data. There is no indication of the use of image, audio, or video data in the provided context.
