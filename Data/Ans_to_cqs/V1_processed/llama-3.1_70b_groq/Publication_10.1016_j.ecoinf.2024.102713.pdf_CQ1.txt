According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data are not explicitly mentioned as part of a deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention various data sources that contribute to the data platform. These sources include:

1. Monitoring network: The provider is CASE, and the frequency is weekly, with a granularity of monitoring task.
2. Satellite images: The provider is ESA, and the frequency is 2-3 days, with a granularity of 100 km2 granule.
3. Weather: The provider is ARPAE, and the frequency is daily, with a granularity of 25 km2 cell.
4. Environment: The provider is CER, and the frequency is yearly, with a granularity of environmental element.

Additionally, the context mentions that the data is stored in a data lake, which is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

It is not clear if these data sources are part of a deep learning pipeline or if they are used for other purposes. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
