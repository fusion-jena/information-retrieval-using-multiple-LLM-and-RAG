Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, acoustic monitoring, and the use of random forest models for species identification.

However, it does mention the use of random forest models, which are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Random forest models can help mitigate the effects of randomness in the data by averaging the predictions across multiple trees.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of multiple replicates and the selection of the best replicate based on performance metrics, such as the F-score. This approach can help reduce the impact of randomness in the model's performance.

But, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of random seed values, batch normalization, or other techniques.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
