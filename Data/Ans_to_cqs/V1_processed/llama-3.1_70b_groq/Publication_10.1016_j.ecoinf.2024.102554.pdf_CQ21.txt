Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to environmental monitoring, satellite instruments, and data acquisition, but it does not provide information on machine learning model training or postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
