Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to research papers on land degradation, soil properties, and ecosystem services, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, one of the papers mentioned, "Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning" by Huang et al. (2019), suggests that deep learning is used in the study, but it does not provide details on the specific data augmentation techniques used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
