Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, it does mention that some of the proposed methods achieved high classification accuracies on three data sets, but the names of these datasets are not specified.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in computer vision and image classification tasks. Instead, it appears to focus on hyperspectral image classification, which may involve different datasets that are specific to this domain.

If you are looking for information on datasets used in HSI classification, you may need to refer to other sources or research papers that specifically focus on this topic.
