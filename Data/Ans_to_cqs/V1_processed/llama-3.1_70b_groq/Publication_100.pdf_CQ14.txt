The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the magnitude of the weight decay (10âˆ’3) is "empirically chosen", which suggests that some form of manual tuning or trial-and-error approach may have been used. However, it does not provide information on whether a grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method was used.
