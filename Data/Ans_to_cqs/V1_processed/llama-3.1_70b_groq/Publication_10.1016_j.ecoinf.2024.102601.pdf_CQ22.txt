The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are Overall Accuracy (OA) and Cohen's Kappa statistic. OA is the proportion of correctly predicted instances (wildfire-affected and unaffected areas) out of the total instances evaluated. The study also mentions that the model achieves a training accuracy of 1.0 and a validation accuracy of 0.924. However, it does not provide information on precision and recall metrics.
