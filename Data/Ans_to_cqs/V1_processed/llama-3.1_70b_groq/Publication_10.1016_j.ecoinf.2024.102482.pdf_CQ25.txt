The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is designed to classify the swimming behavior of C. elegans in a controlled and chemical-contaminated water environment. The model uses the BLS entropy profile as input features and consists of an input layer, three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. The dense layer has a single output for binary classification and multiple outputs for tasks involving more than two classes. The model aims to balance performance and efficiency, enabling real-time predictions on devices with limited computing power.
