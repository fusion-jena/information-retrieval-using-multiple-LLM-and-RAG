The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that "we used well-known values of hyperparameters to train our models" and that "tuning hyperparameters is likely to improve results." This suggests that the hyperparameters were not optimized through methods like grid search or random search, but rather were set to commonly used values.
