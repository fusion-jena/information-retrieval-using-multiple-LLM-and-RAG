I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in Google Earth Engine (GEE). It only mentions that GEE uses Tensorflow, a machine learning and artificial intelligence open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team, but it does not provide information on the underlying hardware resources used for training the model.
