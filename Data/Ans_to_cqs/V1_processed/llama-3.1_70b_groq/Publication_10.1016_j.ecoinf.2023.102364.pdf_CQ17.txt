Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a study involving the Short-billed Gull and the use of machine learning ensembles, including RandomForest, CART, and MARS regression splines, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
