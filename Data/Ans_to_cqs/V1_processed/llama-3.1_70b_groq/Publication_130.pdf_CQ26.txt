To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques are used. 

1. **Oversampling**: This technique involves creating duplicates of the minority class to balance the dataset. In the context provided, oversampling was used for a great tit with only 1,197 images by creating duplicates of 403 randomly sampled images.

2. **Data augmentation**: This procedure involves artificially increasing the sample size by applying transformations to an existing set of images. This technique helps to increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

3. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from different contexts, such as different times of the day and in different lighting conditions, can help to capture the broad range of contexts that the CNN is required for. This technique is mentioned as a solution to ensure that the training dataset contains sufficient variation to capture the broad range of contexts.

4. **Stratified splitting**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, stratified splitting is a technique used to split the dataset into training and validation sets while maintaining the same class distribution. This technique is not mentioned in the context, but it is a common technique used to address data bias.

5. **Undersampling**: This technique involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset. However, this technique is not mentioned in the context, and it is not recommended as it can result in discarding valuable data.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of techniques used to address data bias, and other techniques might be used depending on the specific problem and dataset.
