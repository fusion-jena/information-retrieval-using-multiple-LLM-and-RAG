Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, and YOLOv5, as well as their applications in image classification, object detection, and wildlife conservation.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of batch normalization, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer, helping to improve the stability and speed of training. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) as an activation function, which can help to add nonlinearity to the model.

While the context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used, it is likely that common optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam are used in the deep learning pipeline, as they are widely used in deep learning research. However, without further information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
