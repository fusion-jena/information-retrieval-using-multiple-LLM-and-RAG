Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling using ensemble methods and statistical models, but it does not discuss deep learning models or their preprocessing steps.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training machine learning models, including deep learning models. These steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1
* Data scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance
* Feature encoding: converting categorical variables into numerical variables
* Feature selection: selecting a subset of relevant features to use in the model

But please note that these steps are not mentioned in the provided context, and I'm not aware of the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular study.
