I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. It appears to be discussing data processing and analysis using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for a study on wildfires and land cover types in mainland China. There is no information about machine learning or training processes, so I am unable to provide an answer to this question.
