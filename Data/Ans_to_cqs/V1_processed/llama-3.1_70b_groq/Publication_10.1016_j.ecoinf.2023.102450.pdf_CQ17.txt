Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the use of a Siamese network for animal tracking and classification tasks, and the few-shot learning method to train the network with a limited number of samples. It also discusses the evaluation of animal tracking and the impact of interference, but does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
