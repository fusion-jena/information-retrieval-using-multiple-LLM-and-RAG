Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context mentions the use of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these techniques.

The context mentions the use of various algorithms, such as BEV Faster R-CNN, marker-controlled watershed algorithm, and SLIC, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these algorithms.

Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the context.
