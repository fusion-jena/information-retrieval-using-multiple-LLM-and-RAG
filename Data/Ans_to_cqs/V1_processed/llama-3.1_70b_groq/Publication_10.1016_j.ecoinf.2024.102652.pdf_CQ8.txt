I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article or paper that discusses the use of deep learning for assessing and segmenting salt-affected soils, but it does not provide information on where the code is hosted. The references cited in the article are also academic papers and do not seem to be related to code repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
