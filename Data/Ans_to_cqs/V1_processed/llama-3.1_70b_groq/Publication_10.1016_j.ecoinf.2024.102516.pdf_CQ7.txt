Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the 3-phase processing pipeline for training the network, including the use of GBIF image data and the application of class activation mapping to generate weak segmentation maps. It also mentions the possibility of using the network's weights to train a plant cover prediction network on actual vegetation data or generating zero-shot predictions without training on plant cover annotations. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria such as train, test, and validation sets.
