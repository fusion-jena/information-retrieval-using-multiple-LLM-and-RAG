Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the challenges and limitations of using machine learning methods, such as Random Forest (RF) models, for predicting leaf area index (LAI) and the importance of high-quality training samples. It also mentions the use of deep neural networks for improving prediction accuracy, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
