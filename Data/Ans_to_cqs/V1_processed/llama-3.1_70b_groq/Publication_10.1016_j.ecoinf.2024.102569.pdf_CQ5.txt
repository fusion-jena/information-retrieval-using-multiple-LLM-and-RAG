Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and penalized loss functions, which are unrelated to the query about deep learning datasets.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
