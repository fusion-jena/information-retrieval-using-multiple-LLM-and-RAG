Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting and that tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done for each set. However, it does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used.

The context does mention the use of different machine learning models, including AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes), but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for these models.

Therefore, I do not know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
