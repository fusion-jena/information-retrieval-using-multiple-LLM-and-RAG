The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the SegFormer model, are as follows:

* Optimizer: AdamW
* Momentum parameter (β1): 0.9
* Epsilon (ε): 10^-8
* Beta 2 (β2): 0.999
* Initial learning rate: 0.0001
* Learning rate schedule: Cosine annealing schedule
* Batch size: 8
* Number of epochs: 100

These hyperparameters are used to train the SegFormer model on the UGE-D dataset. The model is trained with the Cross-Entropy loss function, and the weights are initialized with the pre-trained weights on the ImageNet-1K dataset.
