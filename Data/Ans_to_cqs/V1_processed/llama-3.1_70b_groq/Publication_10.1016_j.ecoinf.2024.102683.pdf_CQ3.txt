Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques, attention mechanisms, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and plant identification tasks.

However, it does mention that the proposed approach (SCAM-Herb model) uses a CNN-based method, which may involve some form of data annotation, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of texture characteristics in plant identification, suggesting that the model may use some form of feature extraction or annotation related to texture.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
