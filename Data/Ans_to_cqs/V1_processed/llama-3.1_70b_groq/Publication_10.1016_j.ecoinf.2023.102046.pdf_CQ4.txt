Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the models used (Inception-V3, ResNet, ViT), their architectures, and the training parameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate, optimizer). It also discusses the use of class weights to address dataset imbalance and the evaluation process. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
