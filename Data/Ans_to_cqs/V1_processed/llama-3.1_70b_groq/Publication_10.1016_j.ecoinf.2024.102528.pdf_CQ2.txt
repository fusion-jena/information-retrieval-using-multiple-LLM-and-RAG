The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that audio data is used, as the framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model, which is used for analyzing bird vocalizations. Additionally, the context mentions "deep audio embeddings" and "avian diversity monitoring" which further supports the use of audio data. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
