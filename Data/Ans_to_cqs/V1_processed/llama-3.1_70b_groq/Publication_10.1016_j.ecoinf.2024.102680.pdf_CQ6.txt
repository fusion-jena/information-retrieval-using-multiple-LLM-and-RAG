According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically the UODN model, include resizing the images to the required size and applying algorithms such as mosaic data augmentation. These preprocessing steps aim to make the distribution of the input data more uniform and enhance the ability of the model to represent the data, thereby improving the model performance during training. 

There is no mention of normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps in the provided context. However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform these steps as part of the preprocessing pipeline. But based on the provided context, we can only confirm that resizing and mosaic data augmentation are used as preprocessing steps.
