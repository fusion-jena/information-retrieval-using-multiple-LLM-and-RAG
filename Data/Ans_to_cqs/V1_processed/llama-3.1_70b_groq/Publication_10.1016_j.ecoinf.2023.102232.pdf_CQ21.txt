Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the description of a hybrid MCMC algorithm for parameter estimation in a physiologically based model, and it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
