According to the provided context, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) uses TensorFlow, a machine learning and artificial intelligence open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team, to perform deep learning analysis. However, it does not allow the use of other open-source machine learning systems such as PyTorch, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), or Caffe. Therefore, the answer to the query is that TensorFlow is the framework used to build the deep learning model in GEE.
