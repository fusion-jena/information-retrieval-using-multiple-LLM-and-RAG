The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe (Jia et al., 2014). Caffe is a deep learning framework, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
