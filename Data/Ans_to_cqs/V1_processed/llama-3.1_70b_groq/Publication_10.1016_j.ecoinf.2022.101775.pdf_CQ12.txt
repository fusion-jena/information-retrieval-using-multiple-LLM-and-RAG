Based on the provided context, it appears that a Deep Matrix Factorization (DMF) model is used in the pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions the DMF1 model, which is a type of deep learning model used for reconstructing non-observed representations in a matrix. Additionally, the context mentions variations of the DMF model that incorporate spatial-temporal features.

However, it's worth noting that the context also mentions a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) deep learning model in the paper by Sharma et al. (2020), which is used for sentimental short sentence classification. But it's not clear if this CNN model is part of the same pipeline as the DMF model.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the pipeline uses a Deep Matrix Factorization (DMF) model, and possibly a CNN model, but more information is needed to confirm the exact architecture of the pipeline.
