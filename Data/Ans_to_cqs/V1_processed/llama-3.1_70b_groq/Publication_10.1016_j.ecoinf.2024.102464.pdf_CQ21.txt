Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on the development and evaluation of a species distribution model, specifically discussing the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

However, it does mention the calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves for both training and test data, which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Additionally, the context mentions the use of correlation analysis to enhance the predictive performance of the model and mitigate the risk of overfitting.

But, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, confusion matrix, or other metrics calculation. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.
