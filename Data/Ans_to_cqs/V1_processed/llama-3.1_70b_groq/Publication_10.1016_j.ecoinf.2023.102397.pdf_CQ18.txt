The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors evaluated the performance of the recognizer by measuring the time each software spent on analyzing the entire target dataset (32,640 recordings) and by using evaluation metrics such as F-score, precision, and recall. Additionally, the authors mention that they chose the optimal cut-off thresholds and ran a random forest model using the best replicate and threshold on the test set to evaluate its performance.
