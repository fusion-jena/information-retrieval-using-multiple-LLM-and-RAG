Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any information about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a study on YouTube videos about wild birds, where the authors extracted videos, identified bird species, and analyzed factors that affect the number of views. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
