The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models are not traditional deep learning metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Instead, the performance of the models is evaluated using statistical metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and slope (in linear regression). These metrics are used to assess the models' ability to predict Chla concentration and turbidity values.
