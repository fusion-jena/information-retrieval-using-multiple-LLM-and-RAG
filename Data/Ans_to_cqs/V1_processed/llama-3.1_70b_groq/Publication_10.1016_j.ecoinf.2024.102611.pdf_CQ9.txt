I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The references listed appear to be academic papers and do not include information about data repositories. Additionally, the text does not mention any specific data repository platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide a definitive answer to this question.
