The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was fine-tuned using a dataset of images collected for each class, and that the model was trained with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was evaluated on a test dataset of 70 videos, but it does not provide information on how the test dataset was selected or whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
