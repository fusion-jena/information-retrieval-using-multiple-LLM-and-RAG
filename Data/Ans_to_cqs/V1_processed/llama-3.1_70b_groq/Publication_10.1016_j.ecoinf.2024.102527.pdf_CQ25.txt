The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the model is being used for image recognition, specifically for recognizing empty camera trap images. The context mentions that the model is being trained on camera trap image datasets (SS and LSM) and that the ResNet and InceptionV3 models are widely used for empty camera trap image recognition. Additionally, the context discusses the use of transfer learning and the optimization of the model's performance on the target domain dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely classification, specifically binary classification (i.e., empty vs. non-empty images).
