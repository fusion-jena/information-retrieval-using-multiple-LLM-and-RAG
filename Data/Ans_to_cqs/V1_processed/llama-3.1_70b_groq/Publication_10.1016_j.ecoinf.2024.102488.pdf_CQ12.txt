None of the provided context mentions the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. The context does mention the use of various machine learning models, including LightGBM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, but these are not deep learning models. Additionally, there is a mention of a "deep learning" framework in the context of built-up area mapping in China from GF-3 SAR imagery, but this is not related to the pipeline mentioned in the query. Therefore, I do not know what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
