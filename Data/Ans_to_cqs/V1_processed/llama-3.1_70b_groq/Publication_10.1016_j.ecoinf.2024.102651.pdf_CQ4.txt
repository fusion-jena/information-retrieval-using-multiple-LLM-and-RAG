I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the performance of different classification networks, including CA-Hybrid, ResNet, and ViT, on a dataset of microorganisms or Cervidae images. It also mentions the use of YOLOv7 for object detection and the incorporation of Class Activation Maps (CAM) to improve classification accuracy. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
