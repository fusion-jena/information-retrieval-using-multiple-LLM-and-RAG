The regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. According to the text, "a dropout layer (with a dropout rate of 0.25) was incorporated to prevent overfitting [Jindal et al., 2017]". This indicates that dropout is the specific regularization method used in this study to mitigate the impact of noisy labels on the robustness of the model. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods being used.
