The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically image segmentation. The model is designed to classify pixels in high-resolution orthophotos into different categories. The study mentions that the model is used for a "particular segmentation task" and that it is compared to other classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers. The use of a U-Net architecture, which is commonly used for image segmentation tasks, also supports this conclusion.
