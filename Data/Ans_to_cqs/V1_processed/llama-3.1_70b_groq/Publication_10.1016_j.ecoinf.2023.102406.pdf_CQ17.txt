Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, discussing topics such as classifier selection, sample thinning, and random forests. It does not mention deep learning or neural networks, which are typically associated with regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
