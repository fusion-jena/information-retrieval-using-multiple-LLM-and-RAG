Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the template-matching method, prototypical networks, and post-processing techniques used in the systems submitted to the public challenge. It also discusses the use of various features such as Mel, PCEN, and delta-MFCC, as well as different architectures like CNN, ResNet, and Perceiver. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
