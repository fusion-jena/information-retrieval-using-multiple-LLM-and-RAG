The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of a pre-trained VGGnet and fine-tuning it on the Benthoz15 dataset, as well as experimenting with different patch sizes to achieve the best classification accuracy. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
