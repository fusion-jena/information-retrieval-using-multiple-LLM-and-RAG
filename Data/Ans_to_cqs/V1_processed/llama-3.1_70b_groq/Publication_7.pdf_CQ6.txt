Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep neural networks, specifically VGGnet, and the extraction of image representations from the first fully connected layer. It also mentions the fine-tuning of the network using the Benthoz15 dataset. However, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been applied to the data before training the model.
