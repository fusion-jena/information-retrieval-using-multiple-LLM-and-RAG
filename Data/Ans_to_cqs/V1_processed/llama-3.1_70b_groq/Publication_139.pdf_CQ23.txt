To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was split into five cross-validation folds. This allowed the model to be trained and validated on different subsets of the data, which helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not biased towards a specific subset of the data.

Secondly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset, although the context does not provide specific details about the diversity of the dataset. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained on a database of annotated clips, which suggests that the dataset may have been diverse in terms of the types of sounds and stimuli present.

Thirdly, the model was tested on a validation dataset after training had ceased. This allowed the model's performance to be evaluated on unseen data, which helps to ensure that the model is generalizable to new data.

Lastly, the model's performance was evaluated using multiple metrics, including accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC). This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance and helps to ensure that the model is generalizable to different scenarios.

It is not mentioned whether stratified splitting was used to split the dataset into training and validation sets. However, it is mentioned that 10% of the data was reserved for comparing the training and validation loss/accuracy after each epoch, and a further 10% was reserved for performance testing after all training had ceased.
