The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are not typical image augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, but rather audio deformations that modify the audio signal while maintaining the semantic validity of the recording's label. 

The applied augmentations include:

1. Adding background noise (from 4 different field recordings captured at night containing geophony)
2. Dynamic range compression (using 4 parameterizations: music, film, speech, radio)
3. Pitch shifting (by 4 conservative values of -0.5, -0.25, 0.25, 0.5 semitones, and less conservative values of -2, -1, 1, 2 semitones)
4. Time stretching (by 4 ratios: 0.81, 0.93, 1.07, 1.23)

These augmentations are applied using the MUDA library, which provides further details about the implementation of each audio deformation.
