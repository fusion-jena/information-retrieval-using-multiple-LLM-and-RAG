Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on genetic programming (GP) and its application to system identification of rainfall-runoff models, as well as wavelet signal analysis and other topics. There is no mention of deep learning models or the measures taken to ensure their generalizability.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of Eureka Pro software for GP modeling, which may have some built-in features for ensuring generalizability, such as cross-validation. But without further information, it is impossible to say for certain.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide enough information to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
