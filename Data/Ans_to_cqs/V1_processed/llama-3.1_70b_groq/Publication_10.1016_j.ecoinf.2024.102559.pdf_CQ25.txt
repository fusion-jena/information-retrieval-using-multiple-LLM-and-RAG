The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the model is used for land use and land cover classification. The context mentions the use of a random forest (RF) binary classification model to identify iceplant within Santa Barbara County coast vegetation, and the application of Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification. Additionally, the context cites a review paper on deep learning for land use and land cover classification based on hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely used for classification purposes.
