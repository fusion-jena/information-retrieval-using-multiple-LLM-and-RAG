The platform used to deploy the deep learning model was Microsoft Azure. Specifically, the Data Science Virtual Machine and a NCv2-series virtual machine (NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU) were used for model training and testing. Additionally, a virtual machine running the "E2asV4" instance on Microsoft Azure was used to train the CNN on a CPU.
