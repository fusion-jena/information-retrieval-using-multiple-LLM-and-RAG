Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and specific architectures such as Xception and MobileNetV2, but it does not provide information on the underlying framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
