The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the early stopping criterion, also known as "patience" in Keras. According to the text, the early stopping criterion was set to 50, meaning that if the validation accuracy did not increase after 50 epochs, the training process was halted. This approach helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.
