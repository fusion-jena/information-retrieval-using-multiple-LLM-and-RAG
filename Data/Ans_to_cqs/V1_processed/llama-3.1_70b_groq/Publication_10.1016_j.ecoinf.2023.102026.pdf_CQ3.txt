I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing the use of random forest algorithms for species distribution modeling, specifically in the context of ecological informatics. The text mentions the use of camera trap data and presence-absence data, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
