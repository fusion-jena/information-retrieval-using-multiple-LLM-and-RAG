Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various papers and sources, but it does not provide a clear answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general information on the common practices followed to deploy trained deep learning models. Typically, the process involves model serialization, where the trained model is saved in a format that can be loaded and used for inference. This can be done using various frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.

Platform selection is also an important consideration when deploying a deep learning model. The choice of platform depends on various factors such as the intended use case, scalability requirements, and the need for real-time inference. Some popular platforms for deploying deep learning models include cloud-based services such as AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, or Azure Machine Learning, as well as edge computing platforms such as NVIDIA Jetson or Google Coral.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
