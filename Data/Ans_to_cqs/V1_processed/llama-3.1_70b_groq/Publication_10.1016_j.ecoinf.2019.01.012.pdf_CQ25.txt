The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to classify digital images into two categories: woody vegetation (positive class) and non-woody vegetation (negative class), which includes grass, open soil, buildings, human, animals, sky, water, stone, and asphalt. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images, with the goal of learning to extract relevant features and make accurate classifications. The model is then applied to whole photographs, which are split into 50 Ã— 50 pixel tiles to match the size of the training samples, and predicts the output for each tile to produce a classified image.
