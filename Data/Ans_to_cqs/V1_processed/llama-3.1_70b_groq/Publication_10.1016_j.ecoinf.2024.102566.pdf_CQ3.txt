I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, forest biomass estimation, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. The references cited are mostly related to forest ecology, remote sensing, and carbon dynamics, but none of them mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
