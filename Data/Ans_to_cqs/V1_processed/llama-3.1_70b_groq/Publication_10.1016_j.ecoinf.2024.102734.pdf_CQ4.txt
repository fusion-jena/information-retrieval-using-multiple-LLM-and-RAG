Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different models (ResNet, AST, and HuBERT) on audio classification tasks, discussing their architectures, and evaluating their performance on various datasets. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
