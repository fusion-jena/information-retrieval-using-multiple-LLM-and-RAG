Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud processing platform for the initial LULC classification, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
