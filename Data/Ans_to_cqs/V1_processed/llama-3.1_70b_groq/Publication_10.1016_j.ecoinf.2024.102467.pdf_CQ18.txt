Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context mainly discusses the improvements made to the model architecture to reduce computational complexity and increase training speed, as well as the comparison of the proposed model with the original YOLOv5 algorithm in terms of parameter quantities and detection efficiency. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
