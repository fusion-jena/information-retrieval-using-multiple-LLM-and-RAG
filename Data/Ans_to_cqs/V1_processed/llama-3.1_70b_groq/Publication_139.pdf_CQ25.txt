The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used for bird species classification. The model is trained to classify soundscape recordings into different bird species. The model's performance is evaluated on a validation dataset, and its accuracy is reported to be around 84.9%. The model is also capable of handling multi-label data, where a recording can contain sounds from multiple bird species. In such cases, the model is considered correct if it predicts either or both of the labeled classes.
