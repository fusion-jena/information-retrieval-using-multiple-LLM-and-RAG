I don't know. The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the structure of the SSA-TPRF model, the effect of tile size on accuracy, and various experimental groups, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
