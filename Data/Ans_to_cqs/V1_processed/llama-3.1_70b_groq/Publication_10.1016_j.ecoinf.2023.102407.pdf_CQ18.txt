The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as AUC (Area Under the Curve) and TSS (True Skill Statistic), as mentioned in Table 5. Additionally, the context mentions that the performance of the incremental PL (Pseudo-Labeling) is investigated in terms of AUC in Section 3.3, and the results are shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6. This suggests that the model performance is monitored and evaluated during training using these metrics and visualizations. However, the exact strategy or methodology used to monitor the model performance is not clearly stated.
