The provided context mentions the use of GPU acceleration to expedite computations during the experiments. Specifically, it mentions the use of NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU for radiation therapy and Nvidia GPU with four CUDA kernels for video compression. Additionally, the context mentions the use of CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) which allows computing on the GPU, making it easier for users to develop GPU programs. However, there is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) being used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer is that GPUs are used for training the deep learning model.
