The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that "involves the separation of the training and test data beforehand" but notes that this approach can introduce bias, particularly when dealing with data that contains many zero values. It also recommends using spatial cross-validation techniques to bolster model robustness.

Spatial cross-validation operates by randomly selecting blocks of data for training while reserving others for testing, and this process is repeated multiple times based on the number of specified folds. This iterative approach refines the model's estimation of prediction errors, consequently enhancing overall model performance.

While the context does not provide specific criteria for splitting the data, it suggests that spatial cross-validation can be used to split the data into training and testing sets, and that this approach can help to prevent overfitting and improve model performance.
