The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the images were centre cropped to an equally sized rectangle, which suggests some form of preprocessing or annotation. Additionally, the context mentions that the images were augmented in various ways, such as flipping, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue, which is a common technique used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.

However, it does not provide information on whether techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used. The context primarily focuses on the dataset size, composition, and augmentation techniques, as well as the deep learning model's training parameters, but does not delve into the specifics of data annotation.
