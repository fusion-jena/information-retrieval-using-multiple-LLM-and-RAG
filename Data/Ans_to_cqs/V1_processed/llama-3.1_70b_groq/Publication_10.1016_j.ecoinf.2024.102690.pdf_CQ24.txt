I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be focused on ecological source identification and analysis using a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, and does not discuss deep learning or strategies for handling randomness.
