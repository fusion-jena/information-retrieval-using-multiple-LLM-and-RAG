Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context only mentions the use of a training set and a test set, but it does not provide information on how the data was split or what criteria were used to determine the size of the training set. It only mentions that the number of observations in the training set is reported in the column "train size" in Table 5, and that a training period with <4000 observations generates a model unable to achieve satisfactory performance levels.
