Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the discussion of IFTL (Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning) and its ability to improve learning by restricting overconfidence during transfer learning. It also mentions the execution time analysis of the approaches, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
