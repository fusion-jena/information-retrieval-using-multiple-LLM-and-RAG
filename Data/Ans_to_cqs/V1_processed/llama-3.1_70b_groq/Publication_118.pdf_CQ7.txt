Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the dataset, data pre-processing, and training, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
