The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is based on the validation loss. According to the provided context, the best-performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the Faster R-CNN model during testing. This suggests that the model's performance was continuously evaluated during training, and the model with the lowest validation loss was selected as the final model.
