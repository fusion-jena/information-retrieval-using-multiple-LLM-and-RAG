The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the BEiT model, is classification. The model is designed to accurately differentiate between healthy and unhealthy plant leaf images. The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in a classification task, as shown in Table 16. The model's ability to classify images is also compared to other state-of-the-art models, and it achieves the highest accuracy of 98.1%.
