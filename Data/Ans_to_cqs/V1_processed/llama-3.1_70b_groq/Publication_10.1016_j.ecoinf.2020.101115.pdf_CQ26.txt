I don't know.

The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to the FAIR data principles, data repositories, and ecological sample archives, but it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a relevant answer to the query.
