The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the audio spectrograms have been constrained to 128 Ã— 128 pixel RGB images with values repeated in each color channel to produce a greyscale image. This suggests that some form of data transformation or formatting has taken place, but the specific preprocessing steps are not detailed.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset has been "highly annotated and used in previous studies", which implies that some form of data cleaning or preprocessing may have occurred prior to the current study. However, the exact nature of these preprocessing steps is not specified.

Therefore, while we can infer that some preprocessing has taken place, the specific steps involved are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
