Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of different models, including the WTD-GWO-SVR method, using metrics such as R2, MSE, and MAE. It also discusses the experimental setup, including the data splitting, test environment, and programming languages used. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
