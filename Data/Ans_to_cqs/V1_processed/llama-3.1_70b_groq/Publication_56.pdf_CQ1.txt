The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to remote sensing (RS) data and the mention of Sentinel-2 time series, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected through remote sensing technologies such as satellite or aerial imaging.

The context mentions the use of hyperspectral data, lidar data, and RGB data, which are commonly collected through remote sensing technologies. Additionally, the references to high-resolution remote sensing images and Sentinel-2 time series suggest that the data is collected through satellite imaging.

It is also possible that the data is collected through other methods such as surveys or public datasets, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the raw data is likely collected through remote sensing technologies, but the exact methods are not specified.
