The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or specific optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention the use of the Least Squares (LS) method and Genetic Algorithms (GA) for optimization. The LS method is used as a macro step, and the GA is used to partially optimize the results of the estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. Additionally, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-like algorithm is mentioned, but it is not clear if it is used for optimization or for a different purpose.
