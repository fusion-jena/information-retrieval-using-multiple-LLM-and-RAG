The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through a synergistic application of grid search and cross-validation. Specifically, for the SVM model, the regularization parameter (‘C’) and the kernel type (linear) are calibrated using grid search and cross-validation to balance model complexity and generalization prowess. Additionally, in instances involving non-linear SVMs, the kernel coefficient (‘gamma’) is optimized via grid search to ensure the model’s attunement to the data distribution.
