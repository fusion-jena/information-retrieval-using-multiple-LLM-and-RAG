Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the metadata provided information on which species was recorded, but it does not provide information on the exact location of the bird signals in the recording. However, it does mention that a simple detector based on signal strength was developed to extract segments containing vocalizations from the recordings. This suggests that some form of signal processing or audio event detection was used, but it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
