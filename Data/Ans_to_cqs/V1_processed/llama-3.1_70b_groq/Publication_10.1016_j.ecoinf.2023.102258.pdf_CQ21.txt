The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention some postprocessing techniques used to control the duration of detected events, such as:

* Deleting very short events
* Peak picking and thresholding
* Peak picking, median filtering
* CRNN event filter
* Split-merge-filter; delete very long/short events

These techniques are used to refine the model's predictions, but they are not directly related to the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, as they are not mentioned in the provided context.
