Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text focuses on the architecture and components of the model, such as the encoder, decoder, and reparameterisation, but does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
