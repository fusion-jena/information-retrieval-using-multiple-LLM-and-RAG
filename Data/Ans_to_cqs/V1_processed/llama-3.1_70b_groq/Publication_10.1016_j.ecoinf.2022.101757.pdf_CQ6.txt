Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of a pre-trained DeeplabV3+ model, fine-tuned on the COCO dataset, for semantic segmentation tasks. It discusses the application of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to improve the model's performance in detecting fine details, particularly in skyline delineation.

However, it can be inferred that the pre-trained model was likely trained on a large dataset (COCO) that has undergone some form of preprocessing, as is common practice in deep learning. Typical preprocessing steps for image datasets may include normalization, scaling, and data augmentation. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps used in this context are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, but I can suggest that common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include:

* Normalization: scaling pixel values to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1)
* Scaling: resizing images to a consistent size
* Data augmentation: applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping) to increase dataset diversity
* Cleaning: removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant data from the dataset

Please note that these are general preprocessing steps, and the specific steps used in this context are unknown.
