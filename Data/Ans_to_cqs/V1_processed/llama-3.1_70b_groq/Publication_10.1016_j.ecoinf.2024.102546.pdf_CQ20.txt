Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the learning rate scheme, hyperparameter settings, and other aspects of the model training process, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
