Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, sampling effort, and bias correction in ecological studies. It discusses methods for selecting background sites and correcting for sampling bias, but does not touch on deep learning or randomness in a machine learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
