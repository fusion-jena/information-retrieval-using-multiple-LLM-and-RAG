Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions that Halgamuge et al. (2020) developed an algorithm to collect data automatically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning technology, but it does not provide further details on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
