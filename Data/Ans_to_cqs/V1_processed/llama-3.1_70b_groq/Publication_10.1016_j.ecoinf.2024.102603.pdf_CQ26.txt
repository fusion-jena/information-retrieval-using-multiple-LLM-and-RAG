Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily compares and contrasts XGBoost and deep learning models, highlighting their differences in terms of model architecture, computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets.

However, it does mention that XGBoost can handle structured data and is effective even with limited data, whereas deep learning models generally require substantial datasets to achieve optimal results. Additionally, the context mentions that XGBoost can provide feature importance scores, which can be useful in understanding the decision-making process of the model.

Regarding data bias, the context does not provide any specific information on techniques used to address it during preprocessing. It does mention that XGBoost can handle structured data, which might imply that it can handle balanced datasets, but it does not explicitly discuss techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any points, please let me know.
