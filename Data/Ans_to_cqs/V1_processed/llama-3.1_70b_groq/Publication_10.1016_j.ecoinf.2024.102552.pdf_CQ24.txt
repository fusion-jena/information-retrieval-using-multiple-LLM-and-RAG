I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The text appears to be discussing the use of machine learning methods for classification in ecological informatics, specifically in the context of analyzing historical aerial imagery. It mentions the importance of high-quality input data and the potential limitations of machine learning methods, but it does not address the specific topic of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
