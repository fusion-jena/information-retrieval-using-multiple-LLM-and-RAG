Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention two techniques that can be used to improve the robustness of deep learning models, particularly when working with small datasets: data augmentation and transfer learning.

Data augmentation involves artificially increasing the volume of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Transfer learning involves starting the learning process from a pre-trained model, rather than from scratch. This can help to leverage prior knowledge and reduce the need for large amounts of training data.

While these techniques are not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they can help to improve the robustness of the model and reduce the impact of random variations in the data.

It's worth noting that the provided context is focused on deep learning applications in computer vision, and does not provide a comprehensive overview of strategies for handling randomness in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
