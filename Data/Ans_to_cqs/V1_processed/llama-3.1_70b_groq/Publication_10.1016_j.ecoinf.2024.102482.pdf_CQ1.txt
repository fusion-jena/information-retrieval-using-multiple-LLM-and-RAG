Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data collection methods might vary depending on the specific application.

For instance, in the study on biomonitoring using Caenorhabditis elegans, the data might be collected through laboratory experiments or field observations. In the study on geographical traceability of common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) using shell image analysis, the data might be collected through image capture using cameras or other imaging devices.

In the context of water quality monitoring, the data might be collected through sensors or other monitoring equipment. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, and it is likely that the methods vary depending on the specific application.
