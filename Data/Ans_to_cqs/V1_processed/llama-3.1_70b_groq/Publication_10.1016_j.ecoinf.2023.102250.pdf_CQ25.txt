The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is designed for birdsong classification, which involves studying the distribution, quantity, population structures, and habitat of various bird species. The model aims to classify bird species based on their songs, which can assist in protecting ecosystem diversity. The model uses a neural network architecture, such as VGG, Inception, or ResNet, to extract features from bird images or spectrograms, and then classifies them into different species. The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy in classifying bird species, with some studies achieving an accuracy of up to 89%.
