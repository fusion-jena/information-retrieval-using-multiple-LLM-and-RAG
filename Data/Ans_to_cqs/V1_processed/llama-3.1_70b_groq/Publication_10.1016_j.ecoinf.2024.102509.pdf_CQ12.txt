The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, specifically a Back-Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. This is mentioned in the text as "The BP-ANN used here entailed an input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron." There is no mention of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
