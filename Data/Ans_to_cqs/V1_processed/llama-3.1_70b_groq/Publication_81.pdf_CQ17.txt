The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention the use of Elastic Net, which is a regularization technique that combines L1 and L2 regularization. Elastic Net is used to solve the overfitting problem and improve the generalization ability of the ESK model.
