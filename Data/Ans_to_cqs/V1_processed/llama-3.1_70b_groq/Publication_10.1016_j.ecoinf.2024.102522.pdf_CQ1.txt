Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, ecology, and bioclimate, with references to nighttime light remote sensing, risk assessment of certain species, and mapping construction land. However, it does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
