The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the active learning procedure, query selection strategies, and the use of deep neural networks for dimensionality reduction, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
