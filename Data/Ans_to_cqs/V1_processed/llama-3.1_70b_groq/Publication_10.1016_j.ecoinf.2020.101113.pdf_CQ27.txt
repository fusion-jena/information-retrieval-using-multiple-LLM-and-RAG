Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the model training process, including data preprocessing, model selection (ResNet50), and potential future research directions. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
