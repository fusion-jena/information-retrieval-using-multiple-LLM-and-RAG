Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically address the query about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, grassland management, and machine learning applications in these fields. It does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in machine learning pipelines. Randomness can be handled by setting a fixed random seed value, which ensures reproducibility of results. This is a common practice in machine learning and data science. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods can help to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance.

But, I couldn't find any specific information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines in the provided context. If you're looking for information on this topic, I recommend searching for resources specifically focused on deep learning and randomness.
