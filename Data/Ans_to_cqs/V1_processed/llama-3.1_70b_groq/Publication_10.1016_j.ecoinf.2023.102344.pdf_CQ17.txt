Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the architecture and performance of various deep neural networks, including ResNet and InceptionV3, as well as their applications in image analysis and other fields. It also mentions the use of label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers in InceptionV3, but these are not traditional regularization methods. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
