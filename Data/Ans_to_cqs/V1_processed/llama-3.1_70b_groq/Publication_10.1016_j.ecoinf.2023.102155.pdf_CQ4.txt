I don't know. The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing the performance of different methods for predicting intensity maps, including the use of lasso regularization and bias correction. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
