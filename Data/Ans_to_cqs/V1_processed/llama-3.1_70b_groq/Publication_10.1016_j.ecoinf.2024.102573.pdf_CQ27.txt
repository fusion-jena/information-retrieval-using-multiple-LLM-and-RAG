Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the experimental results, comparison of different frontends, and discussion of the advantages of using deep neural networks for bird species recognition. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
