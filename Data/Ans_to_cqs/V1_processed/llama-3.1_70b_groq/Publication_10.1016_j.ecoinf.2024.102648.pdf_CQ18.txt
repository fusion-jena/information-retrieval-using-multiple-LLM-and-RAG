Early stopping is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It is the process that stops growing additional trees/layers/split when further addition of more trees/layers/split does not improve the validation statistic. In the case of the entire machine learning model, early stopping was enabled so that the model would not overfit the predicted percent CLCuD.
