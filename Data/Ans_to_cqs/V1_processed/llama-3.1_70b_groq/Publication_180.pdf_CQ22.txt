The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that the model's performance is evaluated based on the "correct identification rate" and "processing time (in hours)". The correct identification rate is mentioned as improving up to a certain point and then reaching a plateau, but the specific metrics used to calculate this rate are not specified.
