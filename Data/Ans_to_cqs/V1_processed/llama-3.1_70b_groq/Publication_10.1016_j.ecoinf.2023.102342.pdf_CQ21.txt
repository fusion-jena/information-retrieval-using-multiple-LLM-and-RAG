Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, data acquisition, and processing, as well as the study area and monitoring network map. It also touches on data mining and its applications, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps after model training.

However, it does mention the following steps in the KDD sequence:

* Optimisation and elaboration of the obtained results through statistics
* Mapping and interpretation of the results
* Display of results in an understandable format
* Decision making

These steps seem to be more focused on the overall process of knowledge discovery and decision-making rather than the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
