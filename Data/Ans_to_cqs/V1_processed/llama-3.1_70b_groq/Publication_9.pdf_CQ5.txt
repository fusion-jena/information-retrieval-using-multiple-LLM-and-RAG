The provided context mentions the use of the ImageNet dataset in deep learning pipelines. ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset that comprises more than 14 million high-resolution images across nearly 22,000 categories. It is often used as a starting point for recognition tasks with deep learning.

There is no mention of the MNIST or CIFAR datasets in the provided context. However, it does mention that the utility of pre-trained CNNs is constrained by how relevant the novel input data are to the data the CNN was originally trained on, suggesting that other datasets may be used depending on the specific application.

Additionally, the context mentions the lack of readily available image datasets with high-resolution images, particularly in the field of biology, which may limit the use of certain datasets in specific applications.
