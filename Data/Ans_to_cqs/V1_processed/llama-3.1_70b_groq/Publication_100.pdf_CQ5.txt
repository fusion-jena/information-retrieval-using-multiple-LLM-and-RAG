Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on deep learning applications in remote sensing, mentioning various research papers and studies related to image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and other perception tasks. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in these studies.

One exception is the mention of a novel dataset for semantic segmentation of crop type in Africa, as described in the paper by Rustowicz et al. (2019). However, this is a specific dataset related to remote sensing and not one of the commonly used datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
