The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization. This technique uses a Gaussian process model of the objective function to find the optimal values of the hyperparameters. Specifically, the optimization was performed for the batch size (between 1 and 32) and the initial learning rate (between 1×10-4 and 1×10-2).
