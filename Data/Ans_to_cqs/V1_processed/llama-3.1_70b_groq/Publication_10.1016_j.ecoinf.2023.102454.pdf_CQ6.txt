I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study about Xi'an, China, its economic development, and urbanization, but it does not touch on topics related to deep learning or data preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
