Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly transformers, for wetland mapping and remote sensing data classification. It mentions the use of a proposed model called 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) for adaptively synthesizing wetland training datasets, but it does not provide information on the specific datasets used.

However, it does mention that the model is tested on a pilot site in Avalon, Grand Falls-Windsor, and Gros Morne National Park, and the results are compared with other models such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and CoAtNet. But it does not provide information on the specific datasets used for training or testing these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
