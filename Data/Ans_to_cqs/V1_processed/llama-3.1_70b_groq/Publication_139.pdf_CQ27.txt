The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training database assembly, generating prediction records, and collecting weather data, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

However, it does mention that after neural network training and validation, predictions for the entire unvalidated recording period were generated. Specifically, for each of the five training folds, a single prediction for every 8 s-interval was made for the duration of the year. The five prediction records that resulted were then averaged together to create a single prediction record.

This suggests that the trained model was used to make predictions on new, unseen data, but the exact process of deploying the model (e.g., model serialization, platform selection) is not mentioned.
