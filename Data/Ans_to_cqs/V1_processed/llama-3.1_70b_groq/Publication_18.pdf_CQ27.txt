Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the research and development of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for various applications such as image classification, object detection, and image super-resolution. It also discusses the potential improvements and extensions of these models, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

However, it is mentioned that the model can be transferred to very high spatial resolution images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the automatic identification of specific individuals, suggesting that the model is designed to be scalable and adaptable to different platforms. But the specific details of the deployment process, such as model serialization and platform selection, are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
