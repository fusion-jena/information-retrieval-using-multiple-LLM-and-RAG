According to the provided context, specifically Table 2, the following data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline:

* Flipud (flip up-down)
* Fliplr (flip left-right)
* Mosaic
* Mixup
* Copy_paste
* HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) adjustments:
	+ hsv_h (hue)
	+ hsv_s (saturation)
	+ hsv_v (value)
* Geometric transformations:
	+ Translate
	+ Scale
	+ Shear
	+ Perspective
* Rotation (degrees)

These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's robustness to different types of input data.
