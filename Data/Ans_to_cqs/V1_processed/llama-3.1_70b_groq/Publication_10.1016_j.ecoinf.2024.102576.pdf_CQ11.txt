I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning algorithms for land cover classification using satellite imagery, but it does not provide information on where the data or pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
