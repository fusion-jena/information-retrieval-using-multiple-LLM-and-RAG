According to the provided context, one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is crowd-sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation. This is mentioned in the context of Sharma et al. (2017), where they utilized crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation of karyotyping images of chromosomes.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of light microscopy datasets for automated tracing of neurons, as mentioned in the BigNeuron resource (Gillette et al., 2023). This suggests that microscopy images can be a source of raw data for deep learning pipelines.

There is also a mention of a dynamic image segmentation program called DSeg, which is used to extract backbone patterns for filamentous Bacteria and hyphae structures from microscopy images (Zhang et al., 2019). This implies that microscopy images can be a source of raw data for deep learning pipelines in the context of biological image analysis.

However, the context does not mention the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this question.
