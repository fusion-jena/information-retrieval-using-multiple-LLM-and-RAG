Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in fisheries, image classification, and the use of pre-trained models to compensate for limited labeled data.

However, it does mention the use of visual explanations from deep networks via gradient-based localization, which is related to the Class Activation Map (CAM) technique. Additionally, it mentions image data augmentation as a technique to overcome the limitation of small dataset size.

While data augmentation is not a traditional annotation technique, it is a method used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing images. This can include techniques such as rotation, flipping, and cropping.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of image data augmentation and gradient-based localization techniques.
