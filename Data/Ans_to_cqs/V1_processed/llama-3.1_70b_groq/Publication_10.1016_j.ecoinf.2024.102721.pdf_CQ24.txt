Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning methods for forecasting ecological water demand in an arid oasis, and it discusses the use of LSTM models and Bayesian optimization. However, it does not delve into the details of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
