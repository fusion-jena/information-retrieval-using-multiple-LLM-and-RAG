The provided context primarily focuses on audio data formats in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it mentions the use of spectrograms, which are visual representations of audio signals, and raw audio data. For example, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for environmental sound classification and audio classification tasks, which typically involve processing audio data. Additionally, it mentions the use of Wavenet, a generative model for raw audio.

There is also a mention of image data in the context of citizen science and wildlife images, but it appears to be a secondary focus. The context does not mention video data or CSV data formats explicitly.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily audio data formats, including spectrograms and raw audio data, with some mention of image data.
