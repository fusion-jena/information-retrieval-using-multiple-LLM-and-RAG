I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning algorithms for ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on where the data repository for the pipeline is available. The mentioned references and citations are related to research papers and reports, but there is no mention of a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
