Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models, bias-variance decomposition, and their applications to ecological data, particularly in river health predictions.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of each class.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation.

These techniques are commonly used in machine learning to address class imbalance and data bias issues. However, I couldn't find any specific information on these techniques in the provided context.

If you're looking for more information on these techniques or other methods to address data bias, I recommend consulting additional resources or literature on machine learning and data preprocessing.
