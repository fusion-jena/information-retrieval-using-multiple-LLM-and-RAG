The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through a grid search approach involving cross-validation, specifically focusing on minimizing the errors to achieve the best possible performance. This method is known as Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV). During training, GSCV generates a series of models, each characterized by a different set of hyperparameters, and systematically trains and assesses the performance of these various models through cross-validation. The process concludes with the selection of the model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by its optimal hyperparameter combination.
