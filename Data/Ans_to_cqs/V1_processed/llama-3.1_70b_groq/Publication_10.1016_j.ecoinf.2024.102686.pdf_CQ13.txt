Based on the provided context, the hyperparameter mentioned is the learning rate, denoted as η(t), which decreases with time t. This is mentioned in Equation (4) as part of the weight update process for the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network.

However, there is no mention of the optimizer used in the deep learning model. The context only discusses the SOM network and its weight update process, but does not provide information on the optimizer.

Therefore, the only hyperparameter mentioned is the learning rate, η(t), but the optimizer used is not specified.
