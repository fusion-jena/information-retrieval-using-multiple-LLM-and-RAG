Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were preserved, except for the number of trees, which was set to 500 to improve computational efficiency without losing precision in the BA estimates. This suggests that some level of optimization or tuning was performed, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
