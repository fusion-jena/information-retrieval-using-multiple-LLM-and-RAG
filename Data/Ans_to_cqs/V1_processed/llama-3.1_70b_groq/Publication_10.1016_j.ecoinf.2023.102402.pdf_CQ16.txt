Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses model validation and evaluation metrics, including Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistics (TSS), and Akaike information criterion (AICc). It also mentions the use of these metrics to assess model performance and select the best model. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
