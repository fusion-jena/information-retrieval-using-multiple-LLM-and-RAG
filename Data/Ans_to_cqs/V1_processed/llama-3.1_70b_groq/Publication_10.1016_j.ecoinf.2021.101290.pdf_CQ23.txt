Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to be a collection of references and citations related to various topics, including optogenetics, machine learning, and event-stream processing. There is no specific discussion or mention of a deep learning model or its generalizability. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a meaningful answer to this query.
