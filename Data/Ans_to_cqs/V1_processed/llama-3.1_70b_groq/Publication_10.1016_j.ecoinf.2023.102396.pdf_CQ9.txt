I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article about classifying animal population time series, specifically focusing on rabbits in Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) in Mississippi. The article discusses the use of various methods such as dynamic time warping, hierarchical clustering, machine learning, and state space models for trend analysis. However, it does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide information on the availability of the data repository.
