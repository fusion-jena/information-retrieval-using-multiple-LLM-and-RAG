The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of different deep learning models such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, Inceptionv3, and a custom D-CNN named CoralNet, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know which framework is used to build the deep learning model.
