Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and numbers, which does not provide any clear information about data augmentation techniques.

However, I can provide some general information about common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These techniques include:

1. Flipping: Flipping images horizontally or vertically to increase the size of the training dataset.
2. Rotating: Rotating images by a certain angle to simulate different orientations.
3. Scaling: Scaling images up or down to simulate different sizes.
4. Cropping: Cropping images to focus on specific regions of interest.
5. Color jittering: Applying random color transformations to images.
6. Noise injection: Adding random noise to images to simulate real-world noise.
7. Translation: Translating images by a certain number of pixels to simulate different positions.

These techniques can be applied to images, audio, or text data to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the robustness of the deep learning model. However, without more specific information, I cannot determine which techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
