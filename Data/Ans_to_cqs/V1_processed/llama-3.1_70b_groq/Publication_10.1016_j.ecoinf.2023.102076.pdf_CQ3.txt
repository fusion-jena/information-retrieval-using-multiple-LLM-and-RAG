The provided context does not specifically mention data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, as these are typically used in computer vision tasks. However, it does describe the annotation process used for text classification tasks.

According to the context, researchers can annotate a randomly selected sample of collected data according to their own relevancy criteria. This approach is less suitable for cases where relevant examples make up a small proportion of the collected data, as imbalanced training data can lead to poor classification performance.

In the specific case described, documents were split into chunks of 300 tokens using the NLTK word-tokenizer, and chunks that contained any of the original query terms (i.e., bat-related or exploitation-related terms) were retained. If more than one chunk contained keywords, the first such chunk of the document was retained for use in model training and evaluation.

It is also mentioned that obtaining a sufficient volume of 'gold-standard' training data is integral to achieving high performance in machine learning applications. However, the context does not provide information on other data annotation techniques beyond text annotation.
