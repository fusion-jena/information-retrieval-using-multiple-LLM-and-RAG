The provided context does not specifically mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the challenges of model evaluation and validation in the context of species distribution modeling (SDM). 

It mentions that withholding parts of the training data for validation can be problematic as both training and testing data may suffer from the same spatial and environmental biases. It also highlights the importance of considering all available data and accounting for biases in biodiversity datasets.

While it does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, it does suggest that the package will raise warnings and highlighted messages if the provided information is not sufficient for inferring a species distribution. This implies that the package may have some built-in checks to ensure that the data is sufficient for modeling, but it does not provide details on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
