Based on the provided context, one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in Table 1, which lists the initial hyperparameters space, where the "Dropout rate of the dropout layer" is specified as 0.2 or 0.4. This suggests that dropout is used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in the model.

However, there is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context. It is possible that L2 regularization is not used in this specific deep learning pipeline, but without further information, it is impossible to confirm this.

Therefore, the only regularization method mentioned in the context is dropout, which is used to prevent overfitting in the model.
