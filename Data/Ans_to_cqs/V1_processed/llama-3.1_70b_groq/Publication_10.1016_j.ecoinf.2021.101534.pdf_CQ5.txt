Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on a specific application of deep learning for bird sound classification, and it mentions that the test dataset was obtained from soundscape recordings, which are noisier than focal recordings. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the pipeline.
