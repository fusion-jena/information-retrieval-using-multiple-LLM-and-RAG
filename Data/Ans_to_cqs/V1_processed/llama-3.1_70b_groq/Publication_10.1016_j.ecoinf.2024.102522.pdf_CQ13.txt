I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on the spread of Hyphantria cunea, a type of insect, and the use of nighttime light remote sensing data to predict its presence or absence. The text includes tables and references, but does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
