According to the provided context, the following techniques are mentioned to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline:

1. **Oversampling**: This technique involves augmenting the training data by oversampling the minority class to alleviate the issue of imbalanced datasets, where the target class makes up a small proportion of the text.
2. **Stratification**: Stratification of training data is used to influence the performance of classifiers in identifying relevant texts in testing data. The context shows that stratification of training data for classification tasks 2 and 3 resulted in higher recall of relevant texts within stratified testing sets.

The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as undersampling and diverse data collection, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that researchers can annotate a randomly selected sample of collected data according to their own relevancy criteria, which could be related to diverse data collection.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, and other techniques might be used in addition to oversampling and stratification.
