Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, climate data, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that the dataset might be related to environmental or ecological data, possibly collected from sources such as:

* Climate databases (e.g., BIOCLIM variables)
* Species distribution data (e.g., Maxent)
* Public datasets (e.g., mentioned in the references)

But without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in this particular pipeline.
