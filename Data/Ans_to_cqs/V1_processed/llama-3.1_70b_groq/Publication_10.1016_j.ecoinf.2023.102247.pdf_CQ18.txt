The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. Specifically, 70% of the dataset is used as training data to build the models, and the remaining 30% is used as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) is used as the index to specify the accuracy, with a higher AUC value indicating a more accurate model.
