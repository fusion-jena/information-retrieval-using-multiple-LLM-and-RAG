Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the YOLOv8 model, including the experimental design, network structure, and training parameters. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
