I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to image classification and segmentation using ArcGIS, specifically for analyzing NAIP imagery and historical imagery. It mentions the use of various bands (R, G, B, and IR) and texture measures, but does not mention any deep learning datasets.
