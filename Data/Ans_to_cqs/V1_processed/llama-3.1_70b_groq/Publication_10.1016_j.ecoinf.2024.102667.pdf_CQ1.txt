The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the sources of some datasets used in the research.

According to the context, the land use/cover dataset for China was acquired from RESDC (no further information is provided about RESDC). The dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km Ã— 1 km and covers six major land use/cover categories and twenty-six subcategories.

Additionally, the boundary datasets for ecological engineering are sourced from the National Ecological Science Data Center (http://www.nesdc.org.cn/).

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or other methods for collecting raw data. It appears that the research relies on existing datasets from these sources.
