Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly SLSTM and SGRU models, for time-series prediction and forecasting in various domains such as agriculture, air pollution, and solar energy.

However, it does mention the use of "deep learning architectures" and "neural networks" that can "learn from complex data", but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
