Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily discusses the division of the dataset into training and test sets, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and the characteristics of various machine learning models.

However, it does mention that the division of the dataset into training and test sets is done by random sampling to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimize the risk of bias. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data splitting process, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
