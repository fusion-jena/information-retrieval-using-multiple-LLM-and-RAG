I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a passage about a research study that used various machine learning models, including LightGBM and XGBoost, to predict canopy cover from satellite data. The context discusses the models used, their hyperparameters, and the results, but it does not provide any information about a data repository link.
