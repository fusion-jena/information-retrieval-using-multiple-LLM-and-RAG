According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete are based on the validation loss value. Specifically, the ReduceLROnPlateau strategy is employed, which checks for the following conditions:

* If the validation loss value does not decrease after 5 consecutive epochs, the learning rate is halved.
* If there is no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive epochs, the training process is terminated.

In other words, the training process is stopped when the validation loss value plateaus for 10 consecutive epochs, indicating that the model is no longer improving.
