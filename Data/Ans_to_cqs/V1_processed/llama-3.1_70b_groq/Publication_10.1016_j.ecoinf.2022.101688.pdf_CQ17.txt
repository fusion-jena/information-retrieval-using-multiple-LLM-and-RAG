Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of pre-trained CNN feature extractors, fine-tuning, and transfer learning, but it does not specifically mention techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
