Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on species identification, particularly bats, using machine learning and Bayesian algorithms. It discusses the limitations of current software and the potential benefits of incorporating informative priors and user interaction into the algorithms.

The context does mention the use of machine learning for species identification, citing several studies, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
