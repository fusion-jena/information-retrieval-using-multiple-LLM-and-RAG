Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text only mentions that the approach "required no further user input, pre- or post-processing steps", which suggests that the method used may not have required traditional preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does not provide information on what specific preprocessing steps were or were not used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
