I don't know. The provided context appears to be a collection of numerical data and statistics, but it does not mention anything related to training or validation loss plateau. The text seems to be focused on environmental data, specifically concentrations of SO2, and does not provide any information on machine learning or training criteria. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
