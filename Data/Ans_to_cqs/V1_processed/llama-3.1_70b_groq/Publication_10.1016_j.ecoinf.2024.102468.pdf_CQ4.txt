Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on the classification performance of a Wavelet Transform-Hidden Markov Model (WT-HMM) using varying dataset sizes, and it references several papers on topics such as feature extraction methods, bird species classification, and complex systems. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
