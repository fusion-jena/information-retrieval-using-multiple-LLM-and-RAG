Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, I can provide some general information on this topic.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as weight initialization, dropout, and data augmentation. To ensure reproducibility and consistency in the results, it is essential to handle this randomness properly.

One common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value, which ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is run. This can be done using libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow.

Another strategy is to use techniques like data augmentation, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Data augmentation can be performed using libraries like PAMpal, which is mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, techniques like ensemble methods and cross-validation can also help to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.

While the provided context does not specifically mention these strategies, they are common practices in the field of deep learning.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of BANTER for automated machine learning classification, but it does not provide further information on how randomness is handled in this specific context.
