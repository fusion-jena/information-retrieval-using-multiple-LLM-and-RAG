The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training is done using DEPP v0.2.2 and that the data sets used include simulated data sets and the WoL data set (Zhu et al. 2019). 

For the simulated data sets, the context mentions that branch lengths of the backbone species tree are estimated using sites randomly selected from the genes used in the experiments (32 genes for ILS data and 5 genes for HGT data) with each gene providing 500 sites. This suggests that the raw data may be in the form of genetic sequences or genomic data.

For the WoL data set, the context mentions that branch lengths of the species tree are available from the original study (estimated under GTR+Î“ from 100 randomly selected sites from 381 marker genes). This suggests that the raw data may be in the form of genetic sequences or genomic data as well.

However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified in the provided context.
