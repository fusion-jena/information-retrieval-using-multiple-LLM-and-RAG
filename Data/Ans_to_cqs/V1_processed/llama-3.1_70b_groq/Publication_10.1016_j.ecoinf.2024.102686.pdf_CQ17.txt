Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), but it does not discuss regularization methods.

However, I can tell you that the context does mention the training efficiency of SVM for large sample datasets being not ideal and the need for further optimization of the training algorithm. But it does not provide information on regularization methods.

If you're looking for information on regularization methods, I'd be happy to provide general information on the topic, but it would not be based on the provided context.
