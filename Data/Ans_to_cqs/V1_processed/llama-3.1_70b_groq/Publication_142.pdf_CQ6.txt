The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for Pl@ntNet. However, it does mention that the CNN architecture used is the inception model extended with batch normalization. This suggests that batch normalization is one of the preprocessing steps involved in the training process. 

Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer in a deep neural network. It helps to reduce the internal covariate shift problem, which can slow down the training process. However, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is batch normalization. Other preprocessing steps may be involved, but they are not mentioned in the context.
