Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that class imbalance can introduce undesirable bias and affect the performance of a classifier. It also mentions that the authors dealt with class imbalance in their work, but the specific techniques used are not described in the provided context.

The only data preprocessing technique mentioned in the context is data augmentation, which was applied to all extracted patches through a 90âˆ˜ rotation and vertical and horizontal flips. However, this is not a technique specifically used to address data bias or class imbalance.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this work.
