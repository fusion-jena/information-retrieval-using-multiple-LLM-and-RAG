The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that "80% of the data for each category... were used to build the model" and that "The remaining 20% of the testing" was used for testing. This suggests that the data was split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%), but it does not provide information on the criteria used for this split or whether a validation set was used.
