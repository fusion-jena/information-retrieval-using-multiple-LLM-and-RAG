I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for bird species recognition, but it does not include any information about a publicly available code repository. If you are looking for the code repository, you may want to try searching for the authors' names or the paper's title along with keywords like "GitHub" or "code repository" to see if it is available online.
