Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics (mAP and AP) used to assess the performance of deep learning models on a specific task, the selection of species for the proof of concept, and the training protocols for the Faster R-CNN models.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions that the Faster R-CNN models were pre-trained on ImageNet, which suggests that the weights of the models were initialized using a fixed set of weights learned from a large dataset. This could potentially help reduce the impact of randomness in the model's performance. Nevertheless, without further information, it is unclear what specific strategies were employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
