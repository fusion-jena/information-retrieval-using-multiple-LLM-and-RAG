Based on the provided context, it appears that several deep learning models are used in different pipelines. Specifically:

* A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for wetlands classification from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery (Liu, T., Abd-Elrahman, A., 2018).
* A Marker-Controlled Watershed Algorithm is used for mangrove crown diameter measurement from airborne LiDAR data (Marasigan, R., Festijo, E., Juanico, D.E., 2019).
* A Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) is used for semantic segmentation of polarimetric SAR imagery (Mohammadimanesh, F., Salehi, B., Mahdianpari, M., Gill, E., Molinier, M., 2019).
* A PointNet deep learning model is used for individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data (Chen, X., Jiang, K., Zhu, Y., Wang, X., Yun, T., 2021).
* A Bird’s Eye View (BEV) Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm is used for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas (Martins, J.A.C., Menezes, G., Goncalves, W., Sant’Ana, D.A., Osco, L.P., Liesenberg, V., Li, J., Ma, L., Oliveira, P.T., Astolfi, G., 2021).

It's worth noting that the specific pipeline being referred to in the query is not specified, so it's difficult to provide a single answer. However, based on the provided context, it appears that CNNs and FCNs are commonly used deep learning models in these pipelines.
