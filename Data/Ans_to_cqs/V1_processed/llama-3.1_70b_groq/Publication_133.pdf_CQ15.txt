Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of a loss function and its gradient to modify the model's parameters, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used to update the parameters.

However, it is common in deep learning to use optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSProp to update the model's parameters. But without further information, it is impossible to determine which specific optimization technique is used in this particular pipeline.

It is worth noting that the context mentions the use of YOLOv5, a deep learning model, and provides a link to the GitHub repository of YOLOv5. The repository may contain information about the optimization techniques used in the model, but this information is not provided in the given context.
