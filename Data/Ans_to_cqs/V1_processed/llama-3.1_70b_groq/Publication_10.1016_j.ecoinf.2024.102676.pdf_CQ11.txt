I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions a link to a project called "North-American-Animal-Tracks-Database" (org/projects/north-american-animal-tracks-database), but it does not provide information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
