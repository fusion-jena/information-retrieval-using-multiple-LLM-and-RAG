Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture, and the activation functions used (tansig, tansig, and purelin). However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used to train the model.
