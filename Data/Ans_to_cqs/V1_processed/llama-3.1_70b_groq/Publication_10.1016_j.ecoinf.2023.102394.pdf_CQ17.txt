The text mentions that to reduce overfitting, the authors created dropout layers with dropout rates of 0.2 and 0.3 in the study. However, it does not mention L2 regularization as a method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the only regularization method mentioned in the text is dropout.
