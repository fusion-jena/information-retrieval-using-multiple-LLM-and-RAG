The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, except for the ADE20K dataset. According to the text, the ADE20K dataset was used to train some of the segmentation models in GluonCV, which is used in the development of LaDeco. Specifically, it is mentioned that 55 outdoor visual landscape elements from the ADE20K dataset were used in the study. However, it is not clear if other datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are used in the pipeline.
