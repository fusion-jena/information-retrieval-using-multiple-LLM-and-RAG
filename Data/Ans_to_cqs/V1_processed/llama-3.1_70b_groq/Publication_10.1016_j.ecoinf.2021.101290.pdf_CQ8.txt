Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and references to various tools and technologies, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository.

However, some of the references mention specific tools and frameworks, such as Theano, Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow, and deeplearning4j, which are popular deep learning frameworks. Additionally, some of the references mention AWS Kinesis and Apache Kibana, which are event-stream processing tools.

If the query is asking about a specific deep learning pipeline, it is possible that the code repository is not publicly available or is not mentioned in the provided context. Without more information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not mentioned in the provided context, and it is not possible to determine where it is available.
