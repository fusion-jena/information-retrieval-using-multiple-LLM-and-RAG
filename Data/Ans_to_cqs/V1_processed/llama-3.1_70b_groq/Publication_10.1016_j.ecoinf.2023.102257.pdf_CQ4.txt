I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text discusses the use of machine learning models for image classification and object detection tasks, but it does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given context.
