Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture of the model, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the training process, but does not provide information about the framework used to implement it. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
