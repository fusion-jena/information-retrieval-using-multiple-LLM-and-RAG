Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that Gola et al. (2019) used an "optimizer approach for feature selection and optimizing SVM parameters based on a robust system architecture." This suggests that some form of optimization was used, but the specific method (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
