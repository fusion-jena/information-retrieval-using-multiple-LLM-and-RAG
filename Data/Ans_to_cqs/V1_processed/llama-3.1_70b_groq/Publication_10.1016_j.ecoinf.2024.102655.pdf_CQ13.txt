I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text discusses the performance of different machine learning models (ANFIS, ANN, and SVM) and their evaluation measurements (RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2), but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the models.
