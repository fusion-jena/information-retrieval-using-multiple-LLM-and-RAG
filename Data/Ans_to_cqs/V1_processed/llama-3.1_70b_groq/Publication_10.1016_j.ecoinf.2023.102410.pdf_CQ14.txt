I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. It appears to be a passage about data analysis and tracking methods for pygmy blue whale song vocalisations, including the use of an automatic search algorithm and manual verification of detections. There is no mention of a model or its hyperparameters, so I am unable to provide an answer to this question.
