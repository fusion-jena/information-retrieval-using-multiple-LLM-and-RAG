The context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the data was split into training and testing datasets using an 80% and 20% ratio, respectively. This is a common practice in machine learning, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data.

The context does mention that 20 and 10 random sample locations were selected for the purposes of training and testing, respectively. This suggests that the data was split randomly, but it does not provide information on any specific criteria that may have been used to select the sample locations.

It's also worth noting that the context does not mention a validation set, which is often used in deep learning model training to evaluate the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting. The context only mentions training and testing datasets.
