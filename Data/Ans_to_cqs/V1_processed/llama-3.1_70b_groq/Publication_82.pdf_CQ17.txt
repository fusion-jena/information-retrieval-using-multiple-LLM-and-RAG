The provided context mentions the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it states that the first two fully connected layers (fc{6, 7}) of AlexNet have a dropout layer associated with them, with a dropout ratio of 0.5. Additionally, the context mentions the use of weight decay (L2 regularization) with a value of 0.0005.
