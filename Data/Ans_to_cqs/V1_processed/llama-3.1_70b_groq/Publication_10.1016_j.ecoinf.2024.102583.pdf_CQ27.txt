Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and XGBoost, for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). It also provides information on the performance of these models and their advantages. However, it does not provide details on the deployment process of the trained models, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
