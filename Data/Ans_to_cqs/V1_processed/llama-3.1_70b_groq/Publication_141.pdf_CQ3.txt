The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to visualize the regions of the images most informative for the decision-making process in the deep learning model. This technique generates heatmaps that indicate important aspects of the head capsule used to determine the taxonomic decision-making process of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was constructed under a lab-based protocol of image acquisition with fully controlled position of the larvae (ventral point of view). This suggests that the images may have been annotated or labeled with the taxonomic information of the larvae, but the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, while we can infer that some form of annotation or labeling was used to prepare the dataset, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
