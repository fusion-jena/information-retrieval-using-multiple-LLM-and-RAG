The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather a model for which predictive accuracy metrics were calculated. According to the text, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are:

1. Variance explained (̂ve) as a relative measure of performance
2. Root mean square error (̂rmse) as an absolute performance metric, in response units.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting the response variable. The context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
