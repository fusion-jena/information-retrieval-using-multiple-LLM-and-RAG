The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the performance of predictive models is summarized in Tables 2-4, which suggests that some form of evaluation or monitoring was performed. Additionally, it mentions that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of complete observations of the test set is the lowest when using only complete targets for training, which implies that some form of error measurement or evaluation was used to assess model performance. However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor model performance during training are not explicitly stated.
