The text does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the use of machine learning techniques and segmentation to classify images, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. However, it does mention that accuracy assessment was performed by selecting random points and visually assessing the class at that point, but this seems to be a post-training evaluation rather than a monitoring strategy during training.
