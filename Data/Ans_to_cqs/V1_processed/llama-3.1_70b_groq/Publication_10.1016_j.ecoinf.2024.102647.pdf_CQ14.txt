Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the performance evaluation of machine learning models using various criteria such as R2, NSE, KGE, and COR, and presents the results of different models (Random Forest and CART) in predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
