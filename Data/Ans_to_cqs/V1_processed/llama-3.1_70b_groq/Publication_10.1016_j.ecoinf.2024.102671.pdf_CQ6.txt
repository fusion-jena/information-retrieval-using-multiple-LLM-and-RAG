Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological research, spatial analysis, and data sources, but it does not provide information on deep learning model preprocessing.

However, I can provide general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. These steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model stability and convergence.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing or imputing missing values, and correcting data errors.
* Feature engineering: transforming or creating new features to improve model performance, such as encoding categorical variables or extracting relevant information from text data.

Please note that these steps are general and may not be specific to the context provided. If you are looking for information on preprocessing steps for a specific deep learning model or application, I would be happy to try and help you find more relevant information.
