The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Batch size: 64
* Number of epochs: 10 (initially), but later tuned using a grid search technique
* Learning rate: 0.001 (initially), but later tuned using a grid search technique

The optimizer used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a grid search technique was used to tune the hyperparameters of the final model, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. This suggests that the optimizer may have been tuned as well, but the specific optimizer used is not specified.
