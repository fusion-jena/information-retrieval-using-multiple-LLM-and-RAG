The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is trained to classify images of leaves into one of ten species. The fully connected block is adjusted to feed off the feature vector and output the ten species of leaves. The model is fine-tuned with pre-trained architectures, such as AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201, to learn high-level features from the images and classify them accordingly. The evaluation results, both quantitative and qualitative, suggest that AlexNet and VGG-19 are superior for this task, achieving high-quality abstractions of shape, texture, and venation.
