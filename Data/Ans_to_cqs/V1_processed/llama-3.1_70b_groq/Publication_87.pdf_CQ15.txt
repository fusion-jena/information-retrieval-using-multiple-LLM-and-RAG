Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of PyTorch, a deep learning library, and provides an example of training a model using the `fit_one_cycle` function, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used.

However, it is worth noting that the `fit_one_cycle` function in PyTorch is typically used with the Adam optimizer, which is a popular optimization algorithm for deep learning. But without explicit mention, we cannot confirm this.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of `cnn_learner` and `resnet18` architecture, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
