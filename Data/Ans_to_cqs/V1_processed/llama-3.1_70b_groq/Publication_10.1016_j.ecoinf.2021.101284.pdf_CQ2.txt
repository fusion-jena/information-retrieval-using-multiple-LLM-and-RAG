Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats, specifically X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images, as mentioned in the reference "Castillo, O., 2020. Early diagnosis of covid-19-affected patients based on x-ray and computed tomography images using deep learning algorithm." 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Big Data, which includes environmental data and air pollution data, but it does not specify the format of these data. However, it is mentioned that the data are in the order of terabytes in size, which suggests that they may be in a format such as CSV or other structured data formats. 

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
