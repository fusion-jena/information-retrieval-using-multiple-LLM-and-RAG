Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the architecture and components of the model, including the SPPF module, neck network, and feature fusion techniques, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
