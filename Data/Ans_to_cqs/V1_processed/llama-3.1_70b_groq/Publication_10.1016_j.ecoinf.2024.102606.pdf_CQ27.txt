Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training protocols, data augmentation, and evaluation metrics used to train and evaluate the models. It does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed or serialized, or which platform was used for deployment.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
