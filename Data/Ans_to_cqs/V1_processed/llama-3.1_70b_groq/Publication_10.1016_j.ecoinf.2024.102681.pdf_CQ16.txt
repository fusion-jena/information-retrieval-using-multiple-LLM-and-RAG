Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the results of the study, including the analysis of drought propagation times and the correlation coefficients between drought propagation time and regional influencing factors. It does mention an "iterative approach to extract the weights assigned to the fully connected layers of the model", but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
