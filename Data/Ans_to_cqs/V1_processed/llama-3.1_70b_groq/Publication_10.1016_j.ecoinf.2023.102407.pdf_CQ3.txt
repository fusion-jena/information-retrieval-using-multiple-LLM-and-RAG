Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling (SDM) and pseudo-labeling (PL) techniques for semi-supervised learning in deep neural networks.

However, it does mention pseudo-labeling (PL) as a technique used for data augmentation, where a trained teacher model is used to assign labels to unlabeled data. This technique is used to generate additional labeled data for training a student model.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, and it's not possible to infer this information from the provided text. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
