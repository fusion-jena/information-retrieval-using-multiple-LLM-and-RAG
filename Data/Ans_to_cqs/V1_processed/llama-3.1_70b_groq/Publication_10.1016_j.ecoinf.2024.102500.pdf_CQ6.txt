Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models, such as LGBM, GB, XGB, RF, and ET, and their optimization techniques. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps are crucial before training a deep learning model. Typical preprocessing steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and data normalization
* Feature scaling: scaling numeric features to a common range to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Encoding categorical variables: converting categorical variables into numerical variables
* Normalization: scaling numeric features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1

But, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide specific details on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
