Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning approaches, architectures, and techniques used for satellite image classification, remote sensing, and land cover classification. It mentions the use of satellite images, but it does not provide information on how these images are collected.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected through satellite imaging, as many of the papers mentioned in the context are related to satellite image classification and remote sensing. But the specific methods used for collecting these images, such as the type of satellites or sensors used, are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
