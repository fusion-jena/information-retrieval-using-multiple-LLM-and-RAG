Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental studies, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
