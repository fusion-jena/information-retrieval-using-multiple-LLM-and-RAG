The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on the conceptual model of transfer learning. For the SS and LSM datasets, which are camera trap image datasets, the data is split in a way that keeps the integrity of capture events. A capture event is a set of multiple images taken in succession, and images within the same event are significantly similar to each other. To prevent poor generalization of the DCNN model, all images of an event are put into the same dataset.

For the SS dataset, the data is split into training, validation, and test sets. The training sets are created by randomly selecting capture events from the S_2_100 dataset, resulting in five different training sets containing 2000, 5000, 8000, 10,000, and 20,000 samples, respectively. The validation and test sets are referred to as S_V and S_T, respectively.

The specific criteria for splitting the data are not explicitly stated in the provided context, but it appears that the data is split in a way that ensures the integrity of capture events and allows for a reasonable number of samples in each set. The exact proportions of the data split are not provided, but the context suggests that the split is done in a way that allows for effective model training and evaluation.
