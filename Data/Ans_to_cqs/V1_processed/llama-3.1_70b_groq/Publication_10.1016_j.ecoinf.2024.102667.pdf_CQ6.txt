Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental studies, specifically focusing on vegetation change, climate change, and land use/cover types. It includes mathematical equations and formulas for calculating changes in growing season NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and other ecological metrics.

There is no mention of deep learning models, normalization, scaling, or cleaning in the provided context. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
