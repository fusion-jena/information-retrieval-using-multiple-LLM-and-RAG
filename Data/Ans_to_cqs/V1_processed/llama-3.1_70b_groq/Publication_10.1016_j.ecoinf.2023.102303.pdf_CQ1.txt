Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development of deep learning methodologies, the creation of a weakly labeled fish dataset in turbid waters, and the proposal of two novel deep learning models for fish detection in turbid waters.

However, it can be inferred that the authors collected a new fish dataset, referred to as the FishInTurbidWater dataset, which was then weakly labeled. The context does not provide information on how the data was collected, but it mentions that the dataset was created to contribute to the first weakly-supervised fish dataset in turbid waters.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
