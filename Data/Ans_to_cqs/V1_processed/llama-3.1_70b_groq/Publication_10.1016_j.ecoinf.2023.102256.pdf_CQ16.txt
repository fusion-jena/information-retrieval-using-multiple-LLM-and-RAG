Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text discusses the limitations of current models in bioacoustics, the importance of incorporating metadata, and the goal of the study to explore methods to address this issue. However, it does not provide details on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
