The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images. 

The context mentions various deep learning models such as LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, which are all primarily used for image classification tasks. The context also mentions the use of convolutional layers, pooling operators, and activation functions, which are typical components of image classification models. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a 3 Ã— 3 filter, stride, and receptive areas, which are also typical parameters used in image processing. 

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the data format, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely images. However, it is also possible that other data formats such as audio or video may be used, but there is no explicit evidence to support this.
