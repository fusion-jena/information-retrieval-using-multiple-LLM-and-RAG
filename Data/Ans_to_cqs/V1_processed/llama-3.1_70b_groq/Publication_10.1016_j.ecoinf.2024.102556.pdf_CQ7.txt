The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset was divided into five subsets using k-fold cross-validation. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets using a k-fold cross-validation technique, where each subset served as a validation set and the remaining subsets constituted the training set.

In general, k-fold cross-validation is a common technique used to split data into training and validation sets. The data is divided into k subsets or folds, and each fold is used as a validation set while the remaining folds are used as the training set. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the validation set once.

The context does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set or the method used to shuffle the data. However, it does mention that the k-fold cross-validation technique was used to address concerns about overfitting and to assess the model's generalization ability.
