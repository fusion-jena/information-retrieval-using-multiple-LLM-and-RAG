Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting oil palm yield, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks or tools used to implement these models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
