Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image data, specifically satellite images. The context mentions the use of satellite images from various sources, such as Sentinel-2, HY-1C CZI, and OLCI, which are used for tasks such as land cover classification, water quality assessment, and algal bloom detection. The context also mentions the use of spectral channels, such as blue, green, red, and near-infrared, which are typical of remote sensing data.

There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, while CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are commonly used in data analysis, there is no explicit mention of CSV files being used in the context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline appears to be primarily image data, specifically satellite images.
