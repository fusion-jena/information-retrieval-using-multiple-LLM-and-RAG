Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the performance of the PBP method in comparison to other machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, and Random Forests. It also mentions the implementation of the PBP method in Python using the pypbp package and the use of TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries for the implementation of classification methods.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
