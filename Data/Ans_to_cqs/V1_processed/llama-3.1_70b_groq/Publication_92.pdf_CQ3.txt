The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors worked with biology experts from the MARBEC laboratory to label many videos. They cropped some frames of the videos and created a training database composed of 13,000 fish thumbnails, each containing only one labeled-fish.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors added a class for the background, which is constituted with random thumbnails of the background and specific background thumbnails taken around the fish thumbnails. They also created a class called "part of fish" to ensure that the network does not focus on a distinctive part of a fish, but processes the fish as a whole.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the authors used a bounding box fusion technique in the post-processing step to improve the localization accuracy. However, it does not provide information on whether bounding box annotation was used during the data annotation process.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the data annotation techniques used, it suggests that the authors used a combination of manual labeling and class creation to annotate the data. However, the specific techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned.
