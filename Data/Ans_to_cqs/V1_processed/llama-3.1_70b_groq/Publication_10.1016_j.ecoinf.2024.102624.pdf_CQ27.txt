Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context discusses the classification of input dataset combinations using different classifiers (RF, SVM, MARS) and the assessment of accuracy, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
