Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the configuration of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF) models.

For the MLP model, the context mentions the range of neurons in the hidden layer, which is defined by the Fletcher-Gloss method. However, it does not provide information on the learning rate or optimizer used.

For the RF model, the context mentions three essential parameters that were configured: the number of random regression trees (ntree), the number of division variables (mtry), and the minimum size of nodes (node size). Again, there is no mention of learning rate or optimizer.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
