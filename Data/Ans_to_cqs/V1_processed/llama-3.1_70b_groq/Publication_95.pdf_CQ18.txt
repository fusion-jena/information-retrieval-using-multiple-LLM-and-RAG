The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of the average training loss. According to the context, the average training loss was used to determine when to stop the training. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored by tracking the training loss, and the training was stopped when the loss stabilized, which occurred after 22,000 iterations.
