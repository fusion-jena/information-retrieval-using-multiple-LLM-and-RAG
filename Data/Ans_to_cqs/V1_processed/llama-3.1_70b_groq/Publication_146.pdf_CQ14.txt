The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyperparameter setting was completed based on studies who successfully implemented Yolo in remote sensing cases, and that the default parameters of YoloV3 (0.001, 0.9, and 0.0005 for the learning rate, momentum, and weight decay, respectively) were used. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization technique.
