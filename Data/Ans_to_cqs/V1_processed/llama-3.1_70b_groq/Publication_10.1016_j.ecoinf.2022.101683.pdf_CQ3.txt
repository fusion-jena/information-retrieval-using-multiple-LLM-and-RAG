I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDMs) and discusses methods for reducing spatial autocorrelation in species records, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning.
