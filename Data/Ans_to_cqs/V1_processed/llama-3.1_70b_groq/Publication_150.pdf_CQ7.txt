The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as mentioned in the provided context, is an 80:20 ratio. This means that 80% of the data is used for training and 20% is used for testing. 

The data is first randomly shuffled within each class (species), and then split along the 80:20 ratio to maintain proportional representations in the training and test groups. This approach helps to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data and that the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context. Typically, a validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during training, but in this case, it seems that the test set is used for evaluation purposes.
