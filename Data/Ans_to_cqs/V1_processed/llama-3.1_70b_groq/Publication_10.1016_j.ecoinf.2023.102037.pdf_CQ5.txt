Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few datasets related to insect detection and classification, including:

* "Pest24" dataset, which consists of 25,378 annotated images from 24 pest species.
* COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which is a popular object detection benchmarking dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that the datasets were acquired through various methods, such as automatic imaging traps and wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information on whether MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. If you are looking for information on these specific datasets, I would recommend searching for additional sources.
