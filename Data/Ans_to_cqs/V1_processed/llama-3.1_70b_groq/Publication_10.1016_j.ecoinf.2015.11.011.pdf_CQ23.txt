The provided context does not specifically mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the importance of investigating scale sensitivity and comparing results with other datasets to check for spurious scale-dependent relationships. Additionally, the context mentions the use of historical data sources such as dendrochronological work, historical land surveys, and travel journals to validate the results.

Regarding the specific measures mentioned in the query, the context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the use of machine learning techniques in combination with segmentation to classify images, which suggests that some form of validation or cross-validation may have been used. Nevertheless, the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not explicitly stated.

It is worth noting that the context appears to focus more on the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques, rather than deep learning specifically. Therefore, the measures taken to ensure generalizability may be different from those typically used in deep learning models.
