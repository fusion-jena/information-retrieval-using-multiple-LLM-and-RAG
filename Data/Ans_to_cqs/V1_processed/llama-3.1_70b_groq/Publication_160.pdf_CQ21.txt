The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the use of the SGR algorithm for selective classification, which involves assessing the reliability of the output to decide whether or not to reject the prediction.

The context also mentions the calculation of metrics such as Macro-F1, Top-1 accuracy, and Micro-F1, as shown in Table 3. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of different ResNet architectures on validation and test sets.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of top-5 accuracy on the rejected part of the test set, which is consistently above 80% regardless of the desired risk specified for input into the SGR algorithm. This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated and analyzed after training, but the specific post-processing steps involved are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide a comprehensive list of post-processing steps involved after model training, but it does mention the calculation of certain metrics and the use of the SGR algorithm for selective classification.
