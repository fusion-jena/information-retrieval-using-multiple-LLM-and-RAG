Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental science, with no direct mention of deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of majority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources or environments to reduce bias and increase the generalizability of the model.

These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address data bias and improve the performance of the model. However, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
