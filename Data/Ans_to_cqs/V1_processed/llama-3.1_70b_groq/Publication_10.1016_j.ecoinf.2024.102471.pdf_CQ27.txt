Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the Wav2Vec model for bird species classification, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

The context discusses the pre-training and fine-tuning phases of the model, including the use of a feature encoder, context network, and classification layer. It also mentions the use of Adam optimizer and hyperparameter tuning. However, it does not provide details on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
