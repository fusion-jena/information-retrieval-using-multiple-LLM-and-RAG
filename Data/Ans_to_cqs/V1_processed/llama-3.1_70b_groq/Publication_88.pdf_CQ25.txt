The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is designed for deforestation detection, aiming to classify images into two classes: "deforestation" and "no-deforestation". This is evident from the network architecture, which includes a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to these two classes. Additionally, the loss function used is binary cross-entropy, which is commonly used for binary classification problems.
