Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the optimization of machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and LightGBM) using Optuna, and the evaluation of their performance on a specific task. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or techniques used to address data bias.

However, it does mention "Randomly select a part of data without resampling" as one of the hyperparameters for the LightGBM model, which could be related to addressing data bias. But without further information, it is unclear how this hyperparameter is used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
