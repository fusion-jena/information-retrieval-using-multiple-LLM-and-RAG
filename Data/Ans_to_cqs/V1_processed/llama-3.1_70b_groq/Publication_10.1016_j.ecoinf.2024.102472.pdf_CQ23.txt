Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained and validated using a dataset, and that the hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search method. This suggests that some form of validation was performed, but the specifics are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was compared to other models (XGBoost and ANN) that included all 78 variables, which may indicate that some form of comparison or evaluation was performed to assess the model's performance. However, it is unclear whether this comparison was done using techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
