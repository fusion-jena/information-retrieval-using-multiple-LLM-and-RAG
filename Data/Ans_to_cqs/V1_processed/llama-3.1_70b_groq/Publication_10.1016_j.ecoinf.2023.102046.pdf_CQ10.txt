Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the models used (ResNet-50, Inception-V3, CLIP, and ViT), their architectures, and some details about the fine-tuning process, but it does not provide any information about the code repository.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
