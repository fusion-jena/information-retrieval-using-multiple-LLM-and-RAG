Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a research paper on animal tracking using a Siamese network, and it discusses the methodology, results, and evaluation of the model. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

The context does mention that the training dataset contained an insufficient number of samples, and the authors used the few-shot learning method to train the network. It also defines the classification task as the N-way K-shot problem, but it does not provide details on how the data was split for training and testing.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context.
