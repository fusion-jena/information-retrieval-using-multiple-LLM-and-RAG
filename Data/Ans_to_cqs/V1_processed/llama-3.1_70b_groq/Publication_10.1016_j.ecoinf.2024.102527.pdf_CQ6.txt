Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experiment design, model training, and hyper-parameter settings for a specific task of empty image recognition using transfer learning.

However, it does mention that the models were trained on the training sets and tracked on the validation set, and the performance was tested on the test set. It also mentions the use of the PyTorch 1.7.1 platform and the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9.

But, it does not provide any information about the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that were applied to the data before training the model. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
