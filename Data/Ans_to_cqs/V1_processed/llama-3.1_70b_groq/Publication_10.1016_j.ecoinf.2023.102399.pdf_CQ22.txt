The provided context mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These metrics include:

1. Identified accuracy (%): This metric is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model in detecting fish and estimating their weight.
2. Estimated efficiency (/min): This metric is used to evaluate the efficiency of the model in processing images and estimating fish weight.
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE, g): This metric is used to evaluate the error in the estimated weight of fish.
4. Mean Relative Error (MRE, %): This metric is used to evaluate the relative error in the estimated weight of fish.
5. R2: This metric is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model in estimating fish weight.

These metrics suggest that the model is evaluated on its ability to accurately detect fish, estimate their weight, and process images efficiently. However, precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
