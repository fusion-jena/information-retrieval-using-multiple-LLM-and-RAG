Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the methodology, data curation, and results of a study on animal track recognition, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
