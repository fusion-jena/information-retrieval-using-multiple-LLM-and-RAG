The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the database was compiled from two sources of very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images, but the specific sources are not fully listed. 

It does mention that the image data used in the study comes from Google, Maxar, and the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset. Additionally, it mentions that the metadata of FAO's GDA photointerpreted very high resolution plots were used, which were accessed through Google Maps. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data was collected from a combination of publicly available datasets, satellite and aerial imagery, and possibly other sources, but the exact methods used for collecting the data are not fully specified in the provided context.
