Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the development of fish individual recognition algorithms using deep learning, model compression, and optimization techniques.

However, it does mention that images are processed at a resolution of 1024 Ã— 1024, which suggests that some form of image resizing or scaling might be involved. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Pytorch, which is a popular deep learning framework that often involves normalization and other preprocessing steps.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and provide a more specific answer.

Therefore, my answer is that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
