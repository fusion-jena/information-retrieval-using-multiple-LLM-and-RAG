The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study are:

1. Producer's Accuracy (PA)
2. User's Accuracy (UA)
3. Overall Accuracy (OA)
4. Kappa Statistic (KS)

These metrics are used to assess the performance of the Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models in classifying Landsat images.
