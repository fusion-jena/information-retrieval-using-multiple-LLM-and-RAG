Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the configuration of the model, the hyperparameters used, and the performance evaluation, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
