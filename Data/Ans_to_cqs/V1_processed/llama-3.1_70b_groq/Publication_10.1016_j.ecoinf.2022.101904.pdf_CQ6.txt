Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of transformers in natural language processing and computer vision, and their application in remote sensing and wetland mapping. It also presents the results of various deep learning models, including the proposed 3DUNetGSFormer, but does not provide information on the preprocessing steps used. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
