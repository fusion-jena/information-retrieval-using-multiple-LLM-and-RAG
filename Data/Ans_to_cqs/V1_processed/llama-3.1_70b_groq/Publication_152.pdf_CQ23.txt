The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that data augmentation proved to be an efficient way to increase the F1 score, which suggests that the authors attempted to increase the diversity of the dataset. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors used a relatively small amount of data to train the U-Net neural network, which converged successfully. This suggests that the model may be robust to overfitting, but it does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of RGB images captured by a UAV, which may provide some diversity in terms of lighting conditions and angles. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the dataset was diverse and representative of different scenarios.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, it does not provide a clear answer to this question.
