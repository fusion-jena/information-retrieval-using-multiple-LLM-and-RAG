The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically for recognizing bluespotted ribbontail rays (Taeniura Lymma). The model aims to improve the recognition of this marine animal species using computer vision techniques. The authors mention that they are exploring different aspects and directions to tackle the challenges of recognizing this species, and their initial experiments are focused on deciding on a feature extraction and recognition framework. They also mention that they are comparing the performance of a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with traditional classification methods.
