According to the provided context, two optimization algorithms are mentioned as being used in the deep learning pipeline: Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM). However, it is noted that ADAM was only used preliminarily and was not further considered in the study due to its convergence on a sharp minimum, resulting in negligible accuracy. Therefore, SGDM is the primary optimization algorithm used in the pipeline.
