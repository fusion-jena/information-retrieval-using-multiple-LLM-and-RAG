The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the testing dataset was composed of 500 manually annotated images from the same transect, and the training, validation, and testing datasets were generated using manual annotations. Additionally, the paper mentions that the predictions were made on a large dataset of 58,148 images. The context suggests that the datasets used are specific to the marine science domain, possibly related to the classification of marine images.
