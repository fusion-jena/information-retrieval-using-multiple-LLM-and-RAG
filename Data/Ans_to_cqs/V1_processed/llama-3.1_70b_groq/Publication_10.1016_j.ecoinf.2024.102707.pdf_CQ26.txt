Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the publication of data, code, and trained machine learning models, as well as references to various studies and papers related to ecological informatics and deep learning.

However, it does mention that the authors used many different sets of hyper-parameters in YOLOv6 but found only marginal improvements, and decided to use the default settings. Additionally, they tested working with different spatial resolutions of the imagery but did not find this approach to be beneficial.

There is no mention of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
