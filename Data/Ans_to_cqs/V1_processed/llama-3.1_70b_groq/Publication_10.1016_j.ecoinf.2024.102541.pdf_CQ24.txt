Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on various deep learning models, their applications, and performance metrics, but it does not discuss randomness or strategies for handling it.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of various deep learning models, such as YOLOv5, SSD, and Inception-v4, which may employ techniques to handle randomness, such as random weight initialization or data augmentation. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is impossible to provide a specific answer to this question.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
