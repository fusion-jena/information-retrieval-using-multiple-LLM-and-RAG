The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used in the work is not large enough for deep learning to overcome the problem of overfitting. To address this issue, data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset for network training and overcoming overfitting.

Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, it is not a technique specifically used to address data bias.

The context does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.
