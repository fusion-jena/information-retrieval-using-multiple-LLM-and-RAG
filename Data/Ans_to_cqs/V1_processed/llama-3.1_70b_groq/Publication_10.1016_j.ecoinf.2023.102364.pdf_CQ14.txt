Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses various machine learning models, including RandomForest and MARS regression splines, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

However, it is mentioned that a RandomForest analysis was performed using 200 trees and balanced weights, which suggests that some hyperparameters were chosen, but the method of optimization is not specified. It is possible that the authors used a default set of hyperparameters or optimized them using a method that is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not know the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
