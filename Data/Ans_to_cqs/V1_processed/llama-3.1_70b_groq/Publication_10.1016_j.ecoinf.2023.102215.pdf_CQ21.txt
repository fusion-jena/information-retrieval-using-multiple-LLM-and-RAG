Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. It discusses the use of a deeply supervised approach, loss function, and evaluation metrics such as Binary Cross-Entropy loss, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it is mentioned that the model generates saliency maps (S) at multiple levels and a final predicted saliency map (Spre) during training. But it does not provide information on how these saliency maps are used or processed after training.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
