Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the use of pre-trained CNNs (VGGish, BirdNET, and Wav2Vec 2.0) for extracting embeddings from audio data, specifically female gibbon calls. It mentions the conversion of waveforms to Mel-spectrograms as a signal representation, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know what data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
