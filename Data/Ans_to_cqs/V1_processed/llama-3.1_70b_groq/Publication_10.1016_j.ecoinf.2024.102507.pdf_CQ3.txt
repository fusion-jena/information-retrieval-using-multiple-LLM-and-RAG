Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the effects of data augmentation, sampling, and data conversion on the performance of deep learning models, particularly CNNs, for image classification tasks. It also discusses the importance of transfer learning and the scalability of deep learning models. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
