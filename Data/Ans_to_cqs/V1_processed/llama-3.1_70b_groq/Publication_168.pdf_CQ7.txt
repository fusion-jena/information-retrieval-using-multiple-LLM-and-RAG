The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image were split into the training set and test set with a ratio of 1:9. This suggests that the data was split into two sets: a training set (10% of the data) and a test set (90% of the data). There is no mention of a validation set.
