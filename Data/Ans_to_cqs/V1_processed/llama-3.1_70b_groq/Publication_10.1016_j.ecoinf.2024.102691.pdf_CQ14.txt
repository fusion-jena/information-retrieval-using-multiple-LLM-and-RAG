Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameters used during model training, such as the input image size, batch size, optimizer, and learning rate. However, it does not provide information on the optimization method used to select these hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
