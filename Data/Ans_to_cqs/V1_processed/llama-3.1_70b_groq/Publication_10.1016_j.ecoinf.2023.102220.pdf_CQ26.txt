Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the performance of the PBP method in comparison to other machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, and Random Forests. It also mentions the implementation of the PBP method in Python and the use of libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.

However, it does mention the use of "training-test splits of the time series" to evaluate the performance of the classification methods. This suggests that some form of data splitting or partitioning is used, but it does not provide further details on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
