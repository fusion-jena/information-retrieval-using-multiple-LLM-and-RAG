The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the context, which states that "a semantic segmentation is conducted using our previous works [51â€“53]" and that the resulting images each contain both the real value of pixels of the extracted class and zero for the values of the other classes. This suggests that the model is designed to segment images into different classes, such as urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road. The model architecture, including the use of convolutional and max-pooling layers, also supports this conclusion, as these types of layers are commonly used in image segmentation tasks.
