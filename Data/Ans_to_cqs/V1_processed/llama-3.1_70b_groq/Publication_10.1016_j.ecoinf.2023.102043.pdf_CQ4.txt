Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the audio data processing steps, including converting audio to a monophonic channel, resampling, extracting spectrograms, and calculating Mel spectrograms. It also discusses the use of the YAMNet model for extracting embeddings and the classification results. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
