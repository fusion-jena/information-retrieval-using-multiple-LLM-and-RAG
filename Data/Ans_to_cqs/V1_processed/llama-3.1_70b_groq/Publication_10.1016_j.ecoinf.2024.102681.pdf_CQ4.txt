I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for drought propagation time series forecasting and the architecture of the CNN-LSTM model. It also mentions the compilation of a comprehensive dataset and the use of a sliding window method to generate distinct datasets. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
