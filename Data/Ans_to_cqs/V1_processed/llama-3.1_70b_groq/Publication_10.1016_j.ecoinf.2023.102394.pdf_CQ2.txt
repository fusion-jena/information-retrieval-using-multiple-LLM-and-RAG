Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references and the content, it appears that the deep learning models are used for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) and other ecological components.

From the references, it can be inferred that the data formats used might include CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, as some of the references mention the use of R packages such as "keras" and "modEvA", which are commonly used for data analysis and modeling. Additionally, some references mention the use of datasets, such as the "dataset of carbon density in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems (2010s)" which might be in a CSV or similar format.

However, there is no explicit mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. The focus of the context appears to be on the use of deep learning for predicting ecological components, such as SOC, using datasets and R packages.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is likely that CSV or similar data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline, but the exact data formats used are not explicitly mentioned.
