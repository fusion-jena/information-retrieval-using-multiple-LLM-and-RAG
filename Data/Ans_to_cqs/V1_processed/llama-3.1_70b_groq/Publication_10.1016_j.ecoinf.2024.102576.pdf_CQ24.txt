Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information, as well as the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-Net models. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this query.
