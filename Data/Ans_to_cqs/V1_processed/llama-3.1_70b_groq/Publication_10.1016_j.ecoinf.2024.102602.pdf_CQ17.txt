The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization as regularization methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of an early stop approach with a patience value of 16 to regularize the model and minimize the loss function (binary cross entropy). This suggests that early stopping is used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions that the first CNN model layers were kept frozen during training with transfer learning, which can also help prevent overfitting by reducing the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, the use of a rectifier linear unit activation function (ReLU) in an additional dense layer can also help the model learn nonlinear relationships and facilitate faster convergence during training, which can indirectly help prevent overfitting.

However, it is not clear if other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization were used in the pipeline. Therefore, the answer is incomplete, and more information would be needed to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
