The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of augmentation techniques to introduce variations in the dataset, specifically random saturation adjustments to each training example. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of introducing randomness in the training process to improve the model's robustness and generalization.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of techniques like auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, and filtering during the preprocessing phase, which may also introduce some level of randomness in the data. However, it is not clear if these techniques are used to specifically handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Overall, while the context provides some information on data augmentation and preprocessing techniques, it does not provide a clear answer to the question of how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
