Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning with a pre-trained ResNet50 model, and the modification of the top network with two fully connected layers. It also mentions the use of dropout to reduce overfitting, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
