The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does describe a process of annotating audio segments using a sliding window approach.

According to the context, each annotation contains a start and end time (denoted in seconds). The annotation process involves placing a window at the start time and extracting a segment of audio containing the amplitude values between the start time and start time + l (where l is the length of the segment). The window is then moved by one second in time, and another segment is extracted. This process is repeated until the end of the sliding window exceeds the end time for that annotation.

This annotation technique appears to be a form of temporal annotation, where the goal is to identify specific segments of audio that contain the calls of interest. However, the context does not provide further details on the specific annotation techniques used, such as whether any additional labels or annotations were added to the data.
