The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance at different taxonomic ranks, including L1 (Order), L2 (Family), and L3 (Species) levels. The average and standard deviation of these metrics are reported in Table 4 for the ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3 models validated with multitask learning and pre-trained weights.
