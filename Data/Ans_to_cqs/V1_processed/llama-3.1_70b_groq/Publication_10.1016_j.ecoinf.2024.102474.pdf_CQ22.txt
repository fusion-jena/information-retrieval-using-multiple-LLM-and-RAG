The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. MAD (Mean Absolute Difference)
2. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)
3. EMD (Earth Mover's Distance)
4. SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on predicting NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and RGBI (Red, Green, Blue, and Infrared) bands. Specifically, EMD and OLS are computed based on the observed and predicted NDVI, while MAD and SSIM are computed on all RGBI bands. The ENS score, which is a harmonic mean of the four score components, is also used to evaluate the model's performance. Note that these metrics are transformed into scores, where higher values indicate better model performance, and are normalized such that 0 denotes poor performance and 1 denotes perfect fit between predictions and observations.
