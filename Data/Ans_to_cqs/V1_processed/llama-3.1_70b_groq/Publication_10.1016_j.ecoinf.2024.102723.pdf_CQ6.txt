Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning models. The text only discusses the architecture and implementation details of the two neural networks, MCD and VBI, but does not provide information on data preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know what preprocessing steps are involved before training the models.
