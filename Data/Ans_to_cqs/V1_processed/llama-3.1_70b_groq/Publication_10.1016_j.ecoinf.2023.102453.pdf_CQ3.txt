Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on Vision Transformers, Neural Architecture Search, and transfer learning approaches for image classification, but it does not delve into data annotation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that data annotation is a crucial step in the deep learning pipeline, especially for image classification tasks. Common data annotation techniques for image classification include labeling images with class labels, bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

If you're looking for information on data annotation techniques, I'd be happy to provide general information or point you in the direction of resources that might be helpful. However, based on the provided context, I don't have specific information to share on this topic.
