Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few datasets related to agricultural and pest recognition tasks.

One dataset mentioned is the IP102 dataset, which is a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition, as mentioned in reference [19]. Another dataset is not explicitly mentioned, but reference [20] discusses automatic localization and counting of agricultural crop pests, suggesting that a dataset related to this task might be used.

Additionally, reference [21] mentions a benchmarking of learning strategies for pest detection and identification on tomato plants, which might imply the use of a dataset specific to this task. However, the exact name of the dataset is not provided.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific datasets MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does mention a few datasets related to agricultural and pest recognition tasks, such as IP102.
