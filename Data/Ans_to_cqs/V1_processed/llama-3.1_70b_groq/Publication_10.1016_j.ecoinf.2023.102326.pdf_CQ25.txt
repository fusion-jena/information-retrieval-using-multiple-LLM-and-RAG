The provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model. However, it does mention that sound event classification using machine learning approaches has become more popular in recent years (Phillips et al., 2018; Sethi et al., 2022; Stowell et al., 2019; Ulloa et al., 2018). This suggests that the deep learning model might be used for classification purposes, specifically for sound event classification in the context of urban acoustic ecology.
