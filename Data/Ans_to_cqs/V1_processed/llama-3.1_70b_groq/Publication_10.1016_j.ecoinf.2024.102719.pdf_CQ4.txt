Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, bias-variance decomposition, and applications in various fields like river restoration and student academic performance prediction. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it's worth noting that the context mentions the use of various machine learning models and techniques, such as XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and random forests, but it does not delve into the specifics of data augmentation techniques.

If you're looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I'd be happy to provide general information on the topic. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering. These transformations can help improve the robustness and generalization of machine learning models. However, without more specific context, I couldn't provide more detailed information on the specific techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline.
