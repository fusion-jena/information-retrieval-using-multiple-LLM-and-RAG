Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and hybrid models for modeling and prediction tasks, particularly in remote sensing and environmental analysis.

However, it does mention the importance of data preparation techniques, such as feature selection through stepwise regression and principal component analysis, in refining prediction accuracy. But it does not explicitly discuss techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further questions or context, I would be happy to try and assist you.
