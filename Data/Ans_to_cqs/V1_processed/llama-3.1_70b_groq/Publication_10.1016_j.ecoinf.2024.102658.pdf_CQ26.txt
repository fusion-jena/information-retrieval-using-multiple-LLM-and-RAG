The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of cross-validation (CV) processes to select feature sets for a random forest model. 

The context mentions two types of CV processes: random CV and spatial CV. Spatial CV is used to address the issue of spatial autocorrelation in the data, where the model performance is evaluated by partitioning the training dataset into spatial blocks. This approach is used to select features that are robust to spatial patterns in the data.

While this is not directly related to addressing data bias, it does suggest that the authors are aware of the importance of considering the spatial structure of the data when evaluating model performance.

The context does not mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not know if these techniques are used in this specific context.
