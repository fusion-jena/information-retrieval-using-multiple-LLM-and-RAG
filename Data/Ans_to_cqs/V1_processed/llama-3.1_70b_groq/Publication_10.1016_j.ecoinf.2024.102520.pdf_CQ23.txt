Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research study, possibly in the field of environmental science or agriculture, but it does not provide information on the use of deep learning models or the measures taken to ensure their generalizability.

The context mentions various aspects of the research study, such as the evaluation of land-use changes, climate change complications, and the emission of greenhouse gases. It also lists the contributions of the authors, including writing, visualization, validation, and project administration. Additionally, it provides some numerical data, possibly related to the study's results. However, it does not mention deep learning models or the measures taken to ensure their generalizability.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
