I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions a Python library called "scholarly" used for searching publication records on Google Scholar, and a GitHub repository (https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly) for the library, but it does not provide information on where the data repository for the pipeline is hosted.
