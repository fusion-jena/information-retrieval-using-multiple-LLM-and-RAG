The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the grid search method. According to the text, "All classification models were run with hyperparameter tuning using the grid search method to determine the best sets of function parameters (Table 1)". This means that the model tries all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range (as specified in Table 1) to find the optimal set of hyperparameters that result in the best model performance.
