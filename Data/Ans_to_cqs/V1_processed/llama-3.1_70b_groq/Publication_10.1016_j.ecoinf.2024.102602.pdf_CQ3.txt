The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that an annotation tool was used to save annotations as XML files in PASCAL VOC format. This suggests that the annotations were likely in the form of bounding boxes, as PASCAL VOC is a common format for object detection tasks that involves annotating objects with bounding boxes. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) models, which are typically used for object detection tasks that involve bounding box annotations. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to confirm the exact annotation techniques used.
