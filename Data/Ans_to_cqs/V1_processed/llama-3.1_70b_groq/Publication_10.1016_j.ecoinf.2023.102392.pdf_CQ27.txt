Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the data processing steps for UAV data, land use/land cover classification accuracy, and forest types accuracy using XGBoost. It also mentions some research papers and their findings, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
