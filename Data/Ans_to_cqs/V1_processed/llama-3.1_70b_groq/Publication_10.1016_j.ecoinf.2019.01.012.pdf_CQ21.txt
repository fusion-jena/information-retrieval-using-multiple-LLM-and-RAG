After model training, the postprocessing steps involved include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. According to the provided context, the model's performance was evaluated on two different data sets: individual tiles and whole repeat photographs. 

For individual tiles, the prediction accuracy was calculated using the 5796 tiles from the test set, which was separated from the total number of samples before training. 

For whole repeat photographs, the classification results for each of the 34 images were compared to the corresponding manual classification (reference data). A confusion matrix was prepared for each photograph individually, consisting of pixel numbers for true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

There is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. However, metrics calculation and confusion matrix creation are explicitly mentioned as postprocessing steps.
