The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of sensors and remote sensing in water quality management and monitoring.

For example, the context mentions the use of "acoustic sensors" and "multi-source remote sensing" for monitoring water quality and coverage. It also mentions the use of "on-site sampling" and "low-frequency monitoring" as conventional methods for water quality monitoring.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of "machine learning predictions" and "integrative modeling framework" for predicting chlorophyll-a concentrations and identifying associated drivers. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data for these models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that sensors and remote sensing are likely used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, but the exact methods used are not specified.
