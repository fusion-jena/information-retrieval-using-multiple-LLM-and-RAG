Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be discussing a specific research project that involves using machine learning and deep learning models to predict temperature profiles in water masses and classify days as presenting thermal stratification or not. However, it does not mention the datasets used in the project.

The context does mention that the data analysis was performed using open-source libraries and frameworks for the Python 3 programming language, and that the data were supervised by the CHE before their publication through the SAICA and the SAIH. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query, and I cannot provide a specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
