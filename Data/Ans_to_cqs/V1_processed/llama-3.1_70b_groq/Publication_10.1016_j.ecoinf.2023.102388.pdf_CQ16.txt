The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the target training set is used to train the target model, and the validation set is used to validate the hyper-parameters. This suggests that some form of validation-based stopping criterion may be used, but the specific details are not provided.
