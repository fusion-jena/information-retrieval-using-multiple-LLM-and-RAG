The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is classification, specifically for classifying bird species based on audio recordings. The models, such as SincNet and ResNet152-architecture, are trained on datasets like NIPS4Bplus and BirdCLEF 2020 to learn features from the audio data and classify them into different bird species. The context also mentions the use of embeddings to assist in model selection for classifying unseen data, which further supports the classification purpose of the model.
