The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the provided context, which mentions various CNN architectures such as VGG16, ResNet-50, DenseNet121, and a custom CNN model with a specific architecture (Table 3). The context also discusses the performance and execution time of these CNN models, indicating that they are the primary deep learning models used in the pipeline. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
