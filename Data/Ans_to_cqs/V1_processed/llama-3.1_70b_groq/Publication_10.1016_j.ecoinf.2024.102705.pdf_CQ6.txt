The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques employed to expand the training dataset, including:

* Random adjustments to image size
* Image flipping
* Cropping
* Conversion

These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's robustness to different image variations. However, it does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or cleaning steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that data augmentation techniques are used, but I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved in normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
