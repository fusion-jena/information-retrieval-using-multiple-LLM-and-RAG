Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. It only mentions that the species assemblage predictor is consistent with the optimal set S* when the number of training samples increases, and that it is as simple as training a deep neural network with a cross-entropy loss function on the presence-only samples and thresholding the output softmax probabilities. However, it does not provide information on the specific framework used, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
