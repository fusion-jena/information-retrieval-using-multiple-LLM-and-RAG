The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify water quality into contaminated and non-contaminated classes. The model uses real-time data from IoT devices, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration, to calculate a water contamination index (WCI) and enable a holistic assessment of water quality. The model's output is a classification of the water quality, which can be used to monitor and safeguard aquatic life within the aquaculture industry.
