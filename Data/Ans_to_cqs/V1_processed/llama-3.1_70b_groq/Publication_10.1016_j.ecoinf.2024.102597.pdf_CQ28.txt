I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. In fact, it mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered but not used due to the limited number of samples, which was not conducive to deep learning. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question.
