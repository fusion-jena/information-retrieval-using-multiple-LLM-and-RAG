Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and snippets related to machine learning, forest fires, and data-driven architectures, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, in general, common practices for splitting data in deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets using random sampling.
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in each set.
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k subsets and using each subset as a testing set while the remaining subsets are used for training.

But without more specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular case.
