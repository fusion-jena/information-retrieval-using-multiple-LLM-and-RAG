Based on the provided context, it appears that the data collection methods used in the study involve a combination of field investigation, remote sensing, and existing datasets. Specifically, the study mentions the use of:

1. Field investigation: Conducted to obtain more precise soil information.
2. Digital elevation model (DEM): A 10-m spatial resolution DEM was used as auxiliary data.
3. Satellite imagery: Although not explicitly mentioned, the study references papers that discuss the use of remote sensing data, such as QuickBird imagery, for land cover classification.
4. Existing datasets: The study mentions the use of a soil sample database, which was likely established using a combination of field investigation and existing datasets.

It is not explicitly mentioned whether surveys or public datasets were used for collecting raw data. However, the study does reference papers that discuss the use of various data sources, such as panchromatic bands of high spatial resolution images, for extracting urban land uses.

Overall, the study appears to rely on a combination of field investigation, remote sensing, and existing datasets for collecting raw data.
