Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the effects of sample size and network depth on a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling, the performance of acoustic indices as proxies for bird diversity, and the comparison of different software programs for bird song detection. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
