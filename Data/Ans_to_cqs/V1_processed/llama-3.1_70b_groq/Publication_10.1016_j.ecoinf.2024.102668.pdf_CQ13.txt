I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text appears to be discussing the comparison of audio recording devices and the effects of device bias on acoustic data, as well as the use of acoustic indices for ecological monitoring. There is a mention of machine learning and deep learning in the context of broader comparative analyses, but no specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model are provided.
