The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained using a training dataset (111,244 images) for 50-60 times, and the model's performance was evaluated using a validation dataset (19,614 images). This suggests that the model's performance was monitored by evaluating its performance on the validation dataset after each training iteration. Additionally, the use of batch normalization (BNorm) layers behind the convolutional layers may also help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. However, the specific strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training is not clearly stated.
