Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the models used (EfficientNet and Vision Transformer), transfer learning, and weak supervision, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
