The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the calculation of certain metrics to evaluate the performance of the models.

The context mentions the calculation of four performance measures: average retrieval precision (ARP), average retrieval rate (ARR), F-score, and mean average precision (mAP). The mathematical formulations for these metrics are provided, but it does not mention the calculation of confusion matrices or the generation of saliency maps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is the calculation of the mentioned metrics. The context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as the generation of saliency maps or confusion matrices.
