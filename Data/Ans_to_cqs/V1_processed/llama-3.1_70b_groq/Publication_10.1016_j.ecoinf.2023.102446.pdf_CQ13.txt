I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to discuss a network computation approach called TPINet, which uses information theory-based transfer entropy to generate process networks. The context mentions parameters such as the number of surrogates (100), significance level (1%), and lagged information (Ï„ = 1 to 12), but it does not mention hyperparameters typically associated with deep learning models, such as learning rate or optimizer.
