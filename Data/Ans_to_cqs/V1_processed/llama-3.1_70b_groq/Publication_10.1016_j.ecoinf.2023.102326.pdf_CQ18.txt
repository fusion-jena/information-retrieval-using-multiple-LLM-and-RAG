I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. It appears to be related to ecological informatics, specifically analyzing data from Automatic Aural Devices (AAD) and land use types. There is no mention of a model or its training process, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
