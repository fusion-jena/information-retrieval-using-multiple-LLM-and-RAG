Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture of the proposed model, which follows a VGG style network, and the training parameters, such as the Adam optimizer, learning rate, and batch size. However, it does not provide information on regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in this deep learning pipeline.
