The provided context does not explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the study involves the use of raster data formats, specifically for the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) data and the Lidar data, which are in raster format with spatial resolutions of 10m and 1m, respectively. Additionally, the study uses vector data formats for the Database of parcels and declared agricultural production (BDPPAD), Geobase of the Quebec hydrographic network (GRHQ), and Geobase Adresses Quebec. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the study.
