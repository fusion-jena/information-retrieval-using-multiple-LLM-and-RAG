The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of pre-trained ImageNet weights and fine-tuning the models, but it does not specify the framework used for this purpose. It also mentions the use of Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information about the framework used for building the model. Therefore, I do not know which framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is used to build the deep learning model.
