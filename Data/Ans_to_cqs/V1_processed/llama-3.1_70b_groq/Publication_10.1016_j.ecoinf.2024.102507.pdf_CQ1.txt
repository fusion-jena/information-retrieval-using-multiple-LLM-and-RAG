Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the preparation and processing of the data, such as data reduction, data augmentation, and the use of different deep learning models (e.g., VGG19, ResNet50). It also mentions the interpretation of aerial photos and on-site investigations, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was initially collected.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
