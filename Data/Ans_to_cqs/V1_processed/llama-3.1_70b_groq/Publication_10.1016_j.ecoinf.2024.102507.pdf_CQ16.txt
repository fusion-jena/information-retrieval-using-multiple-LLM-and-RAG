Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to focus on the results of calculations with different parameters (conv_base.trainable and Dropout Rate) for ResNet50 and VGG19 + ResNet50, as well as the execution environment and data preparation. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
