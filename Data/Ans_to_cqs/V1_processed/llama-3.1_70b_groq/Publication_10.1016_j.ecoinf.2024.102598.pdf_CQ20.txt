I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It appears to be a discussion of the performance of different machine learning models (RF, SVM, MARS, BRT, and CART) on a specific task, likely related to forest fire prediction. The context includes tables with performance metrics and statistics, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the models.
