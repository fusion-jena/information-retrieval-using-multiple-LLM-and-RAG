The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), specifically the AlexNet model. This is mentioned in the provided context: "The DCNN model of our study was the AlexNet model, which included five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers (Krizhevsky et al. 2012)."
