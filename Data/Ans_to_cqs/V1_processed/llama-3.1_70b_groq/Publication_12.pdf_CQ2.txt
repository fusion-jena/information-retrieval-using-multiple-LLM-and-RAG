The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are audio-files and images. The audio-files are converted into spectral images, which are then used for modeling. The images are categorized into four categories: strong, weak, no call, and other. The pipeline uses Python scripts, including Coverting_image.py, Making_database.py, and Training.py, in a self-developed open-source software called Waveman. There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
