Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on COVID-19 research, air pollution, and data analysis, with no specific discussion on deep learning or handling randomness in machine learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
