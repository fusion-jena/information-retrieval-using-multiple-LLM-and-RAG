Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the authors contribute the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research and that they anticipate other academics will contribute more datasets to Whiskerbook.org. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

It does mention that the authors used data augmentation techniques such as left-right mirroring to reduce overfitting and strengthen the algorithm's capacity to match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. This suggests that the data may have been collected through visual observations or images of snow leopards, but the exact method of collection is not specified.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context.
