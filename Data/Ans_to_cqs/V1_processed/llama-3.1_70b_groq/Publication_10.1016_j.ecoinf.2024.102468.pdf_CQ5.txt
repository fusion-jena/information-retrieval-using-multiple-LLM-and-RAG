I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to bioacoustics and the use of a Wavelet-Transform Hidden Markov Model (WT-HMM) for classifying cetacean vocalizations. The datasets mentioned in the context are not explicitly named, but rather referred to as "recording months" and "dataset sizes" in the range of 8 to 20 hours. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
