The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy. It mentions that the validation accuracy of the SVM classifier model using features extracted from ResNet-50 was 96.4%, and the test accuracy was 97.4%. Additionally, it mentions that the validation inaccuracies of the SVM classifier model were compared, but it does not provide further details on the metrics used. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only metric mentioned is accuracy.
