Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses various deep learning models such as ERNIE, LSTM-CNN, and HRNet, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
