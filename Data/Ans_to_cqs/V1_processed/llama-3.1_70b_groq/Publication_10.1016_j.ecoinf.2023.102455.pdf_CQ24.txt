Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of metaheuristic optimization algorithms and cross-validation schemes, which may involve randomization.

One relevant reference is the paper by Suganthan and Katuwal (2021), which discusses the origins of randomization-based feedforward neural networks. However, this paper does not provide specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Another relevant reference is the paper by Tao et al. (2024), which reviews hybridized artificial intelligence models with nature-inspired algorithms for river flow modeling. While this paper mentions the use of randomization-based algorithms, it does not provide specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
