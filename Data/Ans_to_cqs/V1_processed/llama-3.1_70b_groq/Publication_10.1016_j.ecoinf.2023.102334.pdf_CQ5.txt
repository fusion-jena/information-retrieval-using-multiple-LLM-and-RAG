Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be discussing the application of computer vision techniques, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT), to facial recognition of sika deer, but it does not mention the datasets used for training or testing the models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
