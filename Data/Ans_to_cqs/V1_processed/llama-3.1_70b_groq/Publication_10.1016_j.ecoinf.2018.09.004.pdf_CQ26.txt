The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the issue of an imbalanced dataset, where one class (Cymodocea) constitutes 75% of the dataset. To address this issue, the authors use stratified cross-validation, which is a technique to ensure that the training and testing sets have the same class distribution as the original dataset.

Stratified cross-validation is mentioned in the context as a way to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias. The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique mentioned that is related to addressing data bias is stratified cross-validation. However, it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias, but rather as a way to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms.
