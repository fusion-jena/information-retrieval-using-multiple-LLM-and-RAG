I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of academic references and a brief description of a study area, but it does not mention anything related to training, validation loss, or criteria for determining when training is complete. The context seems to be focused on environmental and ecological studies, specifically related to vegetation cover, climate change, and remote sensing. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
