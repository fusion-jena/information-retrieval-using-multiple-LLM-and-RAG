I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that a deep learning algorithm is used for early diagnosis of COVID-19-affected patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images, as referenced in the paper by Castillo, O., 2020. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used for training or testing the model.
