The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model is 92.2%, which indicates the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances.
2. Precision: The precision of the model is 92.6%, which represents the number of true positives relative to the sum of true positives and false positives.
3. Recall: The recall of the model is 91.5%, which represents the number of true positives relative to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

Additionally, the confusion matrix (Fig. 3) provides a detailed breakdown of the classification outcomes, including:

* True positives (45.2%): correctly classified instances
* True negatives (47.0%): correctly classified non-instances
* False positives (4.2%): incorrectly classified non-instances
* False negatives (3.6%): incorrectly classified instances

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.
