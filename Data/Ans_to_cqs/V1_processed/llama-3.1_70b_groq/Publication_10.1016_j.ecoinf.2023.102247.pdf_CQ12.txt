None of the mentioned models (CNN, RNN, Transformer) are used in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of machine-learning models, specifically:

* Maximun entropy (MaxEnt)
* RF (Random Forest)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)

These are traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models.
