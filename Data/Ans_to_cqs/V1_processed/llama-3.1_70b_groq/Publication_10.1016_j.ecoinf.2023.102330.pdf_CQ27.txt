Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only mentions the development and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the automatic detection of Northern Bobwhite covey calls (Nolan et al., 2022), and its application in analyzing recordings using a previously developed CNN model (Ruff et al., 2020). However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
