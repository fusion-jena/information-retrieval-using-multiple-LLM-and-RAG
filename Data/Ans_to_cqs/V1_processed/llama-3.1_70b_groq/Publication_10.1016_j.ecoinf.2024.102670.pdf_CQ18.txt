Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a research paper about automated tracing of neurons in light microscopy datasets and mentions the use of crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation, but it does not provide information about the training process or model performance monitoring. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
