Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and numbers, which does not provide any clear information about the hardware resources used for training the model.

However, based on the mention of "Authorized licensed use limited to: Thueringer Universitaets. Downloaded on November 16,2023 at 09:49:35 UTC from IEEE Xplore," it can be inferred that the context might be related to a research paper or academic publication. In many deep learning research papers, authors often mention the hardware resources used for training their models, but this information is not present in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
