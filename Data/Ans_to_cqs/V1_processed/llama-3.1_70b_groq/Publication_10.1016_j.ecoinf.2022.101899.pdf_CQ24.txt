Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and other methodologies for wildfire event prediction in Australia, discussing various approaches, models, and results.

However, it does mention "large variances for the intercept and mean temperature" in Runs 9 and 11, which might be related to handling uncertainty or randomness in the model. But without further information, it's unclear how this relates to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value, based on the provided context.
