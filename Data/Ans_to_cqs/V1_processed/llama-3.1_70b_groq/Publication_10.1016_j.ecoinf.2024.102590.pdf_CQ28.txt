The platform used to deploy the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that Google Earth Engine (GEE) played a significant role in the process, allowing different independent operators to collect training and test samples using a cloud-based server. This suggests that GEE, which is a part of the Google Cloud platform, was used in the study, but it is not clear if it was used to deploy a deep learning model specifically.
