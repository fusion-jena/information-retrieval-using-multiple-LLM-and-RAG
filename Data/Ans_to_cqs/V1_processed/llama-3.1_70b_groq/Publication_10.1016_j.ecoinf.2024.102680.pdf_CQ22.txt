The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Precision, Recall, and Average Precision (AP). 

Precision is the number of true objects predicted by the model as a proportion of the total number of detected objects. Recall is the number of true objects predicted by the model as a proportion of all the true detected objects. Average Precision (AP) is the area under the Precision-Recall curve. 

Additionally, the AP values are calculated for different object categories, and the calculation formula for AP is shown in Eq. (13), where M represents the number of object species. The AP values are used to compare the performance of different models, such as YOLOv8s, CSMB, LKSP, and YOLOv8m.
