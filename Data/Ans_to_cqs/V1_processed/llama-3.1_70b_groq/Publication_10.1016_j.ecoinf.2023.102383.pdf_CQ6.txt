Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the architecture and limitations of residual neural networks, particularly in the context of object detection in UAV thermal images. It explains how feature maps are generated and combined using Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN), but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
