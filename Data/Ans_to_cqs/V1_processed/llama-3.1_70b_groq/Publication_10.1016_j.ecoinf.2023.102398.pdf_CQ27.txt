The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not explicitly described in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the trained model is hosted and run in a cloud-based system. The specific details of the deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection, are not provided.

It is mentioned that the cloud resident camera is placed in the Kohora range of KNP, and the images captured by the camera are fed into the model. The cloud computing infrastructure used for deployment is described, including the processor, GPU, bandwidth, storage, latency, and security features. However, the exact steps followed to deploy the model are not detailed.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the deployment process is not fully described in the provided context, and only some details about the cloud computing infrastructure used for deployment are mentioned.
