The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is the weighted F1 score. The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both the false positives and false negatives in the classification results. The weighted F1 score is used to account for the different classes in the classification problem, which are "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Ripar-ian", designated as "p", "w", and "r" respectively.
