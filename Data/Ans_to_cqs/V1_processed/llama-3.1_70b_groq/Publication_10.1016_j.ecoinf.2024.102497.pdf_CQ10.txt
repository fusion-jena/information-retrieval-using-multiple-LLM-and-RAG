I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a report discussing the use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms, such as CART and Random Forest regression, for coastal water bathymetry. The context mentions the use of Python programming language and the 'sklearn' library, but it does not provide a link to a code repository.
