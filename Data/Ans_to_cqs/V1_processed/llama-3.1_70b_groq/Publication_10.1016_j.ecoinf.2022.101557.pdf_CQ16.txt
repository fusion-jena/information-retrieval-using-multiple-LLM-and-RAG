The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model is trained for 150 epochs, which suggests that the training process is stopped after a fixed number of iterations, rather than being based on a specific performance metric or convergence criterion. Additionally, the text mentions the use of dropout and ADAM optimization, which are techniques used to improve the stability and convergence of the training process, but it does not provide information on how the completion of training is determined.
