I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. In fact, it mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered but not used due to the limited number of samples. The context focuses on various water quality prediction (WQP) algorithms, machine learning methods, and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
