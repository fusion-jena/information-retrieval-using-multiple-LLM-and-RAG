Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on image enhancement techniques, both classical and deep learning-based, and discusses various architectures and evaluation metrics. It does not delve into data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of a specific dataset (UCCS) and the maintenance of consistency in experimental settings, which might imply some level of attention to data handling. Nevertheless, without explicit information on data preprocessing techniques, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context.
