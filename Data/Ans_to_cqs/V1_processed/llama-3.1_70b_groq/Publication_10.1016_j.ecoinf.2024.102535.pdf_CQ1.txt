Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for hydrothermal vents substratum classification. However, it does mention the use of optical imagery datasets organized into large-scale temporal habitat maps, which suggests that the data may be collected through remote sensing or camera-based surveys.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep-sea images, which implies that the data may be collected through underwater cameras or sensors. However, the specific methods or instruments used for collecting these images are not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the limited availability of labeled data for properly training deep learning models in the context of deep-water studies, which suggests that the data collection process may be challenging or limited in some way.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the types of data that may be used in the deep learning pipeline, it does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data.
