Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the limitations of current deep learning solutions for water contamination assessment and proposes a comprehensive framework that incorporates IoT-based data collection and data segregation techniques. It also mentions various studies that have used machine learning and deep learning models for water quality prediction, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.

However, it can be inferred that the use of diverse datasets and cross-validation techniques might be essential to ensure the generalizability of the model. The context mentions the use of IoT-based data collection, which could potentially provide a diverse dataset. Additionally, the use of techniques such as stratified splitting might be necessary to ensure that the model is trained and tested on representative data.

But without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question. Therefore, I can only speculate on the measures that might have been taken to ensure generalizability, but I do not have concrete evidence to support my claims.
