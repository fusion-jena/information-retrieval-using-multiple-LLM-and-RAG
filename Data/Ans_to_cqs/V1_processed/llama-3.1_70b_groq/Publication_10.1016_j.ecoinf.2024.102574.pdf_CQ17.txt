Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, ecology, and forestry applications, with some mentions of machine learning techniques, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
