Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of classical and deep learning methods for generating synthetic data, with a focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for replicating complex patterns and relationships in original datasets.

The context does mention the use of a GAN model for generating synthetic connectivity data, but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques used in the process. It only mentions that the GAN model features a generator component that learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample, and a discriminator that learns to classify real and synthetic data.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
