I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text primarily discusses the challenges of using machine learning approaches for ecology and conservation applications, particularly in the context of detecting invasive species using remote sensing imagery. It highlights the issue of imperfect training data and the use of a multiple-instance learning algorithm to address this problem. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
