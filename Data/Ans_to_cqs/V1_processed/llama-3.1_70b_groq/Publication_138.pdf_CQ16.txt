The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the number of epochs is related to the min-batch size, and that the larger the min-batch size, the larger the number of epochs. This suggests that the training process may be stopped when a certain number of epochs is reached, but the exact criteria for stopping the training process is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the algorithm converges after a certain number of epochs, which implies that the training process may be stopped when convergence is reached. However, the exact definition of convergence is not provided.

Therefore, while we can infer that the number of epochs and convergence may be related to the criteria for determining when training is complete, the exact criteria used is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
