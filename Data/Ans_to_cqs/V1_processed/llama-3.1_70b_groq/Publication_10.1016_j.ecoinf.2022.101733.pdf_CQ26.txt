The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the samples were selected according to a 60%â€“40% ratio for training and validation, respectively, which suggests that some form of stratified splitting may have been used to ensure that the class proportions in the training and validation sets are representative of the real class proportions.

Additionally, the context mentions that the analyst must make methodological decisions that present tradeoffs in data quality (i.e., class representativeness) and quantity while creating training data for RS image classification. This suggests that the authors may have considered techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to address class imbalance issues, but it is not explicitly stated.

There is no mention of diverse data collection or other techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, or ensemble methods that can be used to address data bias. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
