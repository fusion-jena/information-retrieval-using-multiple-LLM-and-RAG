Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of image augmentations such as flip, rotations, and affine transformation to improve training performance. Additionally, it mentions the use of heavier augmentation with techniques like multiply, linear contrast, sharpen, emboss, flip in horizontal and vertical directions, rotations, and affine transformation. 

While these augmentations can help increase the diversity of the training data, they do not directly address data bias. The context does not provide information on whether techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used to address data bias. Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
