Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on describing various deep learning models, including CLIP, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and transformers, as well as their applications and architectures. It does mention that CLIP was trained on 400 million images from the web along with their captions, but it does not provide information on how these images were annotated. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
