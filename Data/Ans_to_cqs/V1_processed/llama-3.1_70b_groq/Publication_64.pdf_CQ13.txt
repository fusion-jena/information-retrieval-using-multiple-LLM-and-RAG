The deep learning model used in the provided context is based on the Lasagne module built on top of Theano. According to the text, the model is trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer as the learning rule. However, the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the model is trained on a GTX 1080 for 6 days, and standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring are applied during training. The images are also downscaled to the ResNet standard 224x224 input size.

It is also mentioned that the model is initialized with the pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset provided in the Lasagne Model Zoo. However, other hyperparameters such as batch size, weight decay, and dropout rate are not mentioned in the provided context.
