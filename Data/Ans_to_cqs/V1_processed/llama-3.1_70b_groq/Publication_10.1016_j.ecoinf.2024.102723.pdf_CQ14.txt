Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on discussing the importance of uncertainty quantification in neural networks, referencing various research papers, and presenting some experimental results. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameter optimization techniques used, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
