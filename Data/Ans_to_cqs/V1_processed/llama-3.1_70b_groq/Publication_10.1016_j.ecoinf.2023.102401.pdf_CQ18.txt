The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP) after the training process is completed. The context mentions that the model's performance is evaluated by validating it against test images and computing these metrics. The results of this evaluation are then used to adjust the model's parameters and structure to improve its detection performance. This process is repeated until a satisfactory level of performance is achieved.
