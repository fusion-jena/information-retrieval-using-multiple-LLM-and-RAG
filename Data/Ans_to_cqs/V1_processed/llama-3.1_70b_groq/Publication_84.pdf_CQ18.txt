The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the "kernelType" was set to "RBF" (Gaussian function) and the parameters "gamma" and "cost" were optimized by testing different values and selecting the combination that achieved the highest overall accuracy. 

Additionally, for the SAE classifier, the optimal number of iterations was estimated by analyzing the mean error and number of misclassified points, as shown in Fig. 6. However, the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training is not clearly stated in the provided context.
