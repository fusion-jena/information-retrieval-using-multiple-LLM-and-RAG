The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of the TPEBO-LSTM model and the optimization of hyperparameters for the LSTM neural network. Additionally, the context highlights the effectiveness of LSTM in tackling carbon emission forecasting challenges, further confirming the use of LSTM in the pipeline.
