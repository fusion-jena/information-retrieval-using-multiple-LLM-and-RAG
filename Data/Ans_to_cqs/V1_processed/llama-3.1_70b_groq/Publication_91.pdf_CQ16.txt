The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions the training parameters, including the batch size, initial learning rate, and exponential decay of the learning rate every 3 epochs. However, it does provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the classifier, including accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate. 

It can be inferred that the training process might be monitored using these evaluation metrics, but the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not provided.
