Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically the LSTM model, for time series forecasting and land use/cover change analysis. It does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
