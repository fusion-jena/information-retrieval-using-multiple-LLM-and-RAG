The provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps. However, it does mention the calculation of metrics and the use of a confusion matrix.

After model training, the context mentions the use of a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The confusion matrix is used to calculate metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. The equations for these metrics are provided as follows:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-Score = 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)

These metrics are used to measure the classification performance of the model. However, the context does not mention any other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps.
