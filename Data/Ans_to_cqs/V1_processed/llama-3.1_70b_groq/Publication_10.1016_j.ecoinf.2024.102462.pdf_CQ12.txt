The text mentions several deep learning models, including ResNet, ViT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. ResNet is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as it uses convolutional layers and residual connections. ViT and Swin are transformer-based models, which are a type of neural network that uses self-attention mechanisms. ConvNeXt is described as a ResNet evolution, suggesting that it is also a type of CNN. Therefore, the pipeline uses a combination of CNNs and transformer-based models.
