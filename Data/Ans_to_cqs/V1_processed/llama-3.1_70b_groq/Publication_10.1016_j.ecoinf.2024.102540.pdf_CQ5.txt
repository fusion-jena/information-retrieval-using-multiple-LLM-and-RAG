Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the dataset used in the study consists of images of alates on sorghum leaves, with a total of 1543 images for the training set, 243 images for the validation set, and 247 images for the testing set at a resolution of 640 × 640 pixels, and 1637 images for the training set, 255 images for the validation set, and 262 images for the testing set at a resolution of 1280 × 1280 pixels.

It appears that the dataset used is a custom dataset specific to the study, rather than a widely used benchmark dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
