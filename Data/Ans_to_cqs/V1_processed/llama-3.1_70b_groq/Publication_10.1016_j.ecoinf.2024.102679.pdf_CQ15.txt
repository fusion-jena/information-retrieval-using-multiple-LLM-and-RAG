Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions that the model was fine-tuned and that the best performance on the validation set was selected to avoid overfitting, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
