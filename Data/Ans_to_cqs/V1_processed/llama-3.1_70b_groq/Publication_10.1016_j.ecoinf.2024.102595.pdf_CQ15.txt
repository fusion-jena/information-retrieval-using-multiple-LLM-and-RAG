Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions that hyper-parameter tuning was performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10), but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
