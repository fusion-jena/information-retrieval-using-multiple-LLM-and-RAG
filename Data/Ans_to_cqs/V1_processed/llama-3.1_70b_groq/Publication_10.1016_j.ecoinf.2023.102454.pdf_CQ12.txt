I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline, nor does it specify the type of model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context appears to be related to energy consumption and carbon emissions in China, and discusses data sources and statistical models, but does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
