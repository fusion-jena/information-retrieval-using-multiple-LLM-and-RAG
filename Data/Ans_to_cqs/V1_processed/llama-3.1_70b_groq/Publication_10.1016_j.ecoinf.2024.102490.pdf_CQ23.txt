To ensure the generalizability of the model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the data was split into a training set (80%) and an evaluation set (20%). This split allows for the model to be trained on a large portion of the data and then evaluated on a separate, unseen portion, which helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can generalize well to new data.

Additionally, the authors applied committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. This approach helps to reduce the variance of the model and improves its robustness.

Furthermore, the authors used two metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the models: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS). The use of these metrics provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and helps to ensure that the model is generalizable.

It is also worth noting that the authors selected the final ensemble models based on a TSS score of â‰¥0.7, which suggests that they prioritized models with high accuracy and generalizability.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided text whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. Therefore, I do not know if these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
