The deep learning pipeline uses image data in the form of RGB input tensors with a size of 224 Ã— 244 pixels. The images are also normalized to ImageNet mean values, and the pixel values are rescaled in the range of [0, 1]. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
