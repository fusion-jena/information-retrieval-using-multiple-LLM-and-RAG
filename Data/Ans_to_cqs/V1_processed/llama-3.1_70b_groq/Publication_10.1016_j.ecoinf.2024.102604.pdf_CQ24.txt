Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on ecological niche modeling, species distribution, and environmental covariates, with no mention of deep learning or randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
