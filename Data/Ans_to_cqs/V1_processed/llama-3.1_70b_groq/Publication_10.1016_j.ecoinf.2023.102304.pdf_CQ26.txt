Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and geospatial analysis, discussing topics such as wildfire, vegetation cover, and climate conditions. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you.
