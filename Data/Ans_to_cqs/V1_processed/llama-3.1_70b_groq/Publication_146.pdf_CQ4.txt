Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the impact of multi-optimizers and data augmentation on TensorFlow convolutional neural network performance was studied in [18]. 

Although the specific data augmentation techniques used are not mentioned, it can be inferred that some form of data augmentation was used, as it is mentioned that the model was tested under "very difficult circumstances and complex backgrounds" and still yielded good detection capabilities. 

Common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping, but without further information, it is impossible to determine which specific techniques were used in this case.
