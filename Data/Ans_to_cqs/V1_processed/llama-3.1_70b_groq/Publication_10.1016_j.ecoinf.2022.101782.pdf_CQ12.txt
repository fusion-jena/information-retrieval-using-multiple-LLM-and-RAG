According to the provided context, the pipeline uses two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The first CNN is a ResNet101 object detection model, which is used for bird object detection. The second CNN is a custom-trained ResNet50 model, specifically designed for red kite detection. This model was trained using transfer learning on citizen science data.

There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers being used in the pipeline. The context only mentions the use of CNNs, specifically ResNet101 and ResNet50 architectures.
