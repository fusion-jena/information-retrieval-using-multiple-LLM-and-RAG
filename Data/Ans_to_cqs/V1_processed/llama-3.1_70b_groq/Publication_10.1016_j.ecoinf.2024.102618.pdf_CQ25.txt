The purpose of the deep learning model in this work is classification, specifically plant disease classification. According to the text, "In this work, we propose deep-learning architectures to classify plant diseases." This indicates that the primary goal of the deep learning models is to classify plant diseases, rather than performing tasks such as segmentation or detection.
