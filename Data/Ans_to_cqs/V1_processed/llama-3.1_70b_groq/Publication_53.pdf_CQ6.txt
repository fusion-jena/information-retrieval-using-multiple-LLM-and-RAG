The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, such as normalization or scaling. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to help generalize the model. 

The data augmentation techniques used include:

- Vertical flipping of images ("flip_vert = TRUE")
- Limiting overly exposing the images ("max_lighting = 0.02")
- Disabling the zooming augmentation ("max_zoom = 1")
- Reducing the memory load on the graphical processing unit (GPU) by converting the data to 16-bit floating-point numbers ("to_fp16 = TRUE")

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was initialized with an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model, which may have involved some preprocessing steps, but the specific details are not provided.
