Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the model was evaluated using validation data, which consists of 321 image tiles. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or ratio used for the split is not specified.

It is common practice in deep learning to split the data into training, validation, and test sets, typically in a ratio of 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the context mentions that the data set created is relatively small in a deep learning context, but it does not provide information on how the data was split to address this limitation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
