I don't know. The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily discusses the use of BirdNET, a research project for automated bird species identification, and its settings, but does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline or how randomness is handled within it.
