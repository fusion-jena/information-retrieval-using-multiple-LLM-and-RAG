The text does not mention the use of GPUs or TPUs for training a deep learning model. In fact, it does not mention deep learning at all. It talks about running analyses on a 10-core central processing unit (CPU) with AMD EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster. Therefore, the answer is that the text does not mention the use of GPUs or TPUs, but rather a multi-core CPU.
