Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on various research papers and studies related to machine learning, ecology, and animal behavior, but it does not provide information on techniques for addressing data bias.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed techniques used to address data bias and imbalance in machine learning. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the data, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class.

Diverse data collection is also an important technique for addressing data bias, as it involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the data is representative of the population.

It's worth noting that the context does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and support vector machines, but it does not provide information on how data bias is addressed in these studies.
