Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and citations from various fields, including ecology, archaeology, and remote sensing, with some mentions of deep learning and convolutional neural networks.

However, I can try to provide some general information on common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Some popular optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSProp, and Adagrad. These techniques are used to update the model's parameters during training, with the goal of minimizing the loss function.

But, I must emphasize that this information is not directly derived from the provided context, and I couldn't find any specific mention of optimization techniques in the given references. If you're looking for information on a specific paper or study, I'd be happy to try and help you with that.
