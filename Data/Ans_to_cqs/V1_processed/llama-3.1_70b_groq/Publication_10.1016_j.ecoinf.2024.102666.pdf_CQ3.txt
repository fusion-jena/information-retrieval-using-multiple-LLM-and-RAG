Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and aquatic environments, discussing various algorithms and models for atmospheric correction, land cover classification, and water quality monitoring.

However, I can mention that the context does mention the use of deep learning models, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), for tasks like land use/land cover classification and chlorophyll-a retrieval. But it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
