The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Random rotation
2. Random cropping
3. Random flipping
4. Random color jittering
5. Random noise addition

These techniques were implemented using Kera's flow_from_directory method during the learning phase of the CNN to ensure that all possible cases that might occur in the real world are covered.
