To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a large dataset of 111,244 images, which likely included diverse examples of bat calls. Additionally, the model was tested on a validation dataset of 19,614 images, which was filtered to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

Furthermore, the model was tested on unfiltered audio files collected from different human and natural conditions to evaluate its ability to generalize to new environments. This included recording the same species under different conditions to assess the model's robustness.

The model was also optimized by adding new kinds of Batch Normalization (BNorm) layers behind the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting. This allowed the model to learn from trends in both "known" and "unknown" datasets, rather than maximizing performance on the training dataset.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. It is also unclear whether the dataset was stratified or if any other measures were taken to ensure the diversity of the dataset.
