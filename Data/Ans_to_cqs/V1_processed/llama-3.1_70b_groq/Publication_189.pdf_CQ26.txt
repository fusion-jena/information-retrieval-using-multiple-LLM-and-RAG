The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data collection and annotation in the context of creating a custom dataset. 

It mentions that the dataset will be created from scratch and annotated for custom training, and that images will be collected using a fixed camera. This suggests that the authors are taking steps to collect diverse data, but it does not provide information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.

One of the references, [27] Poojary, Ramaprasad & Raina, Roma & Mondal, Amit Kumar, mentions the effect of data augmentation on fine-tuned CNN model performance, which could be related to addressing data bias. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if this is the case.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
