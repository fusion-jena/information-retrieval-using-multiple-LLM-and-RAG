The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of various callbacks and metrics. Specifically, the model uses callbacks such as "ReduceLROnPlateau", "ModelCheckpoint", and "EarlyStopping" to dynamically modify the learning rate and preserve the optimal model iteration according to the validation accuracy. Additionally, the model's performance is recorded using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, model size, and analysis time throughout the training phase, which spans 35 epochs with a batch size of 16.
