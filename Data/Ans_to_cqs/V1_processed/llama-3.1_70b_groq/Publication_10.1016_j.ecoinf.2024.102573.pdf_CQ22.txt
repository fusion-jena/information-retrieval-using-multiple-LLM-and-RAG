According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy
2. Top-3 accuracy
3. F1-score
4. Precision
5. Recall

These metrics are reported in Table 2, which shows the test results of the different frontends. The context also mentions that the macro-averaged F1-score on the validation set is used to monitor the model convergence, indicating that the F1-score is an important metric for evaluating the model's performance.
