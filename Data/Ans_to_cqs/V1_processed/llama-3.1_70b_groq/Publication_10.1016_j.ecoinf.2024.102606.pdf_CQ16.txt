The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions that the models were trained with the same parameters, including 500 epochs, an initial learning rate of 0.01, and data augmentation transformations. However, it does not specify how the training process was stopped or what criteria were used to determine convergence.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
