Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study analyzed AGB estimation based on "field data" and "remotely sensed optical and SAR datasets". This suggests that the raw data may have been collected through field measurements and remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or aerial imagery. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "196 sample plots" for field-estimated aboveground biomass, which implies that some form of field survey or measurement was conducted. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified in the provided context.
