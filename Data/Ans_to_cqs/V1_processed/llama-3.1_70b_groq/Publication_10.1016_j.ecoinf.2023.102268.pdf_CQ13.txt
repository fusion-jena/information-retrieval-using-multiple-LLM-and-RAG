Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that a SVM with a cubic polynomial kernel was used as the final classification model, and that a 10-fold cross-validation was used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (CNN) or the SVM model.
