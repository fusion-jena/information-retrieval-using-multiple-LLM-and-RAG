The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model improvement can be achieved by prioritizing images of poorly sampled species with higher error rates, which implies that the dataset may be imbalanced.

Additionally, the context mentions that exploring new ways of learning and data generation may further enhance the model, and it specifically mentions that generative adversarial networks (GANs) may help improve error rates for poorly sampled species and low accuracy due to class imbalance by generating synthetic image data when new images are difficult to acquire. This suggests that GANs can be used to address class imbalance, but it does not provide information on other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.

It also mentions that data augmentation can be beneficial for convolutional neural networks, citing a paper titled "Further advantages of data augmentation on convolutional neural networks". However, it does not provide more information on how data augmentation was used in this specific context.

Therefore, the only technique mentioned in the context that can be used to address data bias is the use of GANs to generate synthetic data for poorly sampled species.
