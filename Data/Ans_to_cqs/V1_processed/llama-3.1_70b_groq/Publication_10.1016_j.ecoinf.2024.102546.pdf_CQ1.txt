Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Public datasets: The text mentions a systematic search in major databases, including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv, to collect existing weed datasets.
2. Surveys: The text mentions a "public weed dataset survey" which suggests that surveys may be used to collect data.
3. Sensors: Although not explicitly mentioned, the text mentions "camera" and "capture time" which suggests that sensors such as cameras may be used to collect data.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of methods used for collecting raw data, and it's possible that other methods such as manual data collection, crowdsourcing, or IoT devices may also be used. However, based on the provided context, the above-mentioned methods are the ones that can be inferred.
