The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only provides information about the layers and tensor/vector shapes of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for mercury analysis and clubmoss/spikemoss classification, as well as the author contributions and acknowledgements. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
