Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to focus on various applications of deep learning, including sentiment analysis, urban vitality identification, and environmental feature extraction, but does not delve into the specifics of managing randomness in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of pre-trained models, such as the "ERNIE" model, and the combination of different models, like LSTM-CNN, for sentiment analysis. These approaches might involve techniques for managing randomness, but the specific strategies used are not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of metaheuristics-tuned XGBoost algorithm, which might involve techniques for handling randomness, but again, the specific strategies used are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
