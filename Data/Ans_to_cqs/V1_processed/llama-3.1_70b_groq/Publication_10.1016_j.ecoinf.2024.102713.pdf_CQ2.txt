Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a data platform and its components, including data sources, integration and enrichment processes, validation and loading, and analytical fruition. However, it does not provide information on the data formats used in the pipeline.

The context does mention that the data sources include monitoring networks, satellite images, weather data, and environmental data, but it does not specify the formats in which these data are stored or used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
