I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning methods, specifically Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks, for modeling growth in forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It also provides some background information on these methods, but it does not address the specific question about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
