The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the training data generation, neural network implementation, and tuning of the U-Net-like CNN architecture. The context mentions that the network training assessment was performed on sub-images generated from image #2, and images #4 and #6 were used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm efficacy. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including model serialization and platform selection.
