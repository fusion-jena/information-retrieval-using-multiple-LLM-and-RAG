Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) are normalized by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. This is a common technique used to normalize the input data, but it is not typically considered a data augmentation technique.

The context also mentions that the expected activation in the following convolutional layers remains unchanged, which suggests that some form of normalization or standardization is applied to the input data. However, it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
