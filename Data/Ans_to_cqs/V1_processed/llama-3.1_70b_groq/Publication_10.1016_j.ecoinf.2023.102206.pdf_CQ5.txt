Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention several other datasets used in various applications, including:

* Housing dataset
* Synthetic dataset
* Email spam filtering text dataset
* Brodatz texture dataset
* Intel Berkeley dataset
* De Montfort university robotics dataset
* Robotics laboratory data
* Glutamic acid fermentation process modeling dataset
* Multivalued (MV) data modeling dataset

These datasets are used in various applications, such as land use classification, driver drowsiness estimation, spam filtering, texture image segmentation, and multitask regression learning. However, none of these datasets are specifically mentioned as being used in a deep learning pipeline.
