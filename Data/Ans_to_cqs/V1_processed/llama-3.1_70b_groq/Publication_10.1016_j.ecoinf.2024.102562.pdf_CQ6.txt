The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the same dataset was trained with ResNet-101 network with heavier augmentation for 500 epochs. The context also mentions that the selection of image augmentations is of crucial importance to improve training performance.

From the context, we can infer that the following preprocessing steps might be involved:

* Image augmentation: The context mentions that multiply, linear contrast, sharpen, emboss, flip in horizontal and vertical directions, rotations, and affine transformation were used for heavy augmentation.
* Data normalization or scaling: Although not explicitly mentioned, it is likely that the data was normalized or scaled before training the deep learning model.

However, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, feature extraction, or feature engineering. Therefore, we cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.
