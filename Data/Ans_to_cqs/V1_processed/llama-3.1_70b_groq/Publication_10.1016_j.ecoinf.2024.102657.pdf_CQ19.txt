Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for classification tasks, but it does not provide information about the underlying frameworks or libraries used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
