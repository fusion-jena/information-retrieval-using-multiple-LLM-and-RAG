Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the use of Bayesian statistics and ultrasound analysis for bat identification, and discusses the use of R-code and QGIS for data analysis and visualization. It does mention the production of figures and the storage of results in a .csv file, but does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
