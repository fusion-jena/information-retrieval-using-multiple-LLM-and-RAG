Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. It only mentions that a min-max scaler is reverted at the end to compute the performance metrics in the test set, but it does not specify which metrics are used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
