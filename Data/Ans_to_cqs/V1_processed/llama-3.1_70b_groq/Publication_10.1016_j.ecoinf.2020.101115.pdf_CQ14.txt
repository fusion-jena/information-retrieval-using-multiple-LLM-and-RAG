I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization or model training. The text appears to be discussing data models, vocabularies, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on how hyperparameters are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
