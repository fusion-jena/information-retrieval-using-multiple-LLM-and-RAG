Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the detection of man-made underwater objects, bird surveys, and human activity recognition using deep learning models. It discusses various studies and methodologies, but it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used.

However, it is mentioned that the study by Abu et al. (2022) proposes a contour-based features analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environments. Additionally, the study by Çalıs¸kan (2023) uses 3D posture data to detect human activity types using deep learning models. But, the data annotation techniques used in these studies are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
