Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the model training procedure, the use of transfer learning with COCO pre-trained weights, and the architecture of the model (ResNet-101), but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
