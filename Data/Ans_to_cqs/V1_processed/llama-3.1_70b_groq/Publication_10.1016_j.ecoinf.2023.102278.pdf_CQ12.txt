The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the models used are ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3, which are both CNN architectures. The text mentions that the ResNet50 architecture was modified and trained with transfer learning using pre-trained weights from ImageNet, and that the EfficientNetB3 model was also used for multitask learning with transfer learning. Additionally, the text describes the proposed network architecture as a CNN, such as ResNet or EfficientNet, with additional fully connected (FC) layers and activation functions for hierarchical classification.
