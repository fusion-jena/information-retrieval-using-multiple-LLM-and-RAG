The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a model in general, which are:

* Coefficient of determination (R2)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
* Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE)

These metrics are mentioned in the context of assessing the model's performance using the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation. However, it is not explicitly stated that these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model specifically.
