Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting sea surface temperature (SST) and significant wave height (SWH) using a dataset from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. It discusses the use of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and other machine learning models, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
