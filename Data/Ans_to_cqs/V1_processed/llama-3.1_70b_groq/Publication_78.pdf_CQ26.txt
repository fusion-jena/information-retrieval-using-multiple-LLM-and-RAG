Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on comparing the performance of different classifiers and deep learning models for coral reef classification, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it does mention the need for a massive dataset for achieving higher accuracy in coral reef classification, which could be related to data bias. But it does not provide any specific information on how to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
