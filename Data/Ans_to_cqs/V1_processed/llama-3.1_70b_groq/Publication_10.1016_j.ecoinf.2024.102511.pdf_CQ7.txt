Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning methods to bioacoustic classification tasks, but it does not provide specific details on data splitting criteria.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to split data into training, testing, and validation sets using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or k-fold cross-validation. The specific criteria used to split the data can depend on the characteristics of the dataset, the goals of the project, and the requirements of the model.

If you're looking for information on data splitting criteria, I would recommend consulting a machine learning textbook or a reliable online resource, such as scikit-learn documentation or Kaggle tutorials.
