The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the proportions used for splitting the data into training and validation datasets. 

For the sociable weavers and great tits, the context mentions that 900 images were used for the training dataset and 100 images for the validation dataset. For the zebra finch data, 400 pictures were used for training and 100 for validation. 

It can be inferred that the data was split based on the number of images available for each species, with a general guideline of using 100 images for validation and a larger proportion for training. However, the exact criteria used to split the data, such as random sampling or stratified sampling, are not specified in the provided context.
