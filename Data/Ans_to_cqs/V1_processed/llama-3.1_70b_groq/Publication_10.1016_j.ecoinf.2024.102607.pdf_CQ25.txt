The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is classification, specifically for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping and crop mapping. The context mentions the use of machine learning algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, decision trees, and artificial neural networks for LULC mapping. It also mentions the use of a hexagonal random-sampling strategy and a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, Sentinel imagery, and neural networks for crop mapping in Canada. The overall purpose of these models is to classify different land cover types and crops from remotely sensed data.
