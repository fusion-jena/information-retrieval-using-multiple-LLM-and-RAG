Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context only discusses the training configuration, classification accuracy, and the architecture of the neural network, including the convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. It also mentions the calculation of classification accuracy using the sklearn library, but it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
