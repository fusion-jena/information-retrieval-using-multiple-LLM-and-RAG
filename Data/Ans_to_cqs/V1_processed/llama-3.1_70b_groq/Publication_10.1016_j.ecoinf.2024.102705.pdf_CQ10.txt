I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for ecological tasks, specifically image processing for camera trap images. The text includes references to various research papers and conferences, but does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
