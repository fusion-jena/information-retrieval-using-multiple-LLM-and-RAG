The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are listed in Table 1. They include:

* Optimizer: ADAM (Kingma and Ba, 2017)
* Learning rate: 0.003
* Batch size: 32
* Epochs: 100
* Dropout rate: 0.5
* Loss function: Binary Cross Entropy

These hyperparameters were manually tuned to achieve optimal model performance.
