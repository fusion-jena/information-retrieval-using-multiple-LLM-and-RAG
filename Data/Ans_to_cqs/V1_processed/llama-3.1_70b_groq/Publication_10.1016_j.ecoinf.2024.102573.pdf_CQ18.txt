The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use the first five seconds of the validation recordings. This approach was chosen because the labeled species are usually present during the first few seconds of the recordings from Xeno-Canto, and it significantly reduces the computation time while producing valid results compared to the full-length evaluation used for the test set.
