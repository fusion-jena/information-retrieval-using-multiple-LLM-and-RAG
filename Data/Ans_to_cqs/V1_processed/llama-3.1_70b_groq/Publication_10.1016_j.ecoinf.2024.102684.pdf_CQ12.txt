The text does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of pre-trained networks with convolutional layers, which suggests that the model may be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, it mentions the use of a fully connected network architecture, also known as a multi-layer perceptron, which is often used in conjunction with CNNs. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided text.
