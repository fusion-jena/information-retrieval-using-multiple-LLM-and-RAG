To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a stratified random sampling approach was used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. This approach ensured that the training and testing datasets accurately represented the distribution of Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. By using this approach, the model was trained and tested on a representative sample of the data, which helped to prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additionally, cross-validation techniques were employed to evaluate the model's performance during the grid search process. This involved training and testing the model on multiple subsets of the data, which helped to ensure that the model's performance was not biased towards a specific subset of the data.

Furthermore, the grid search process itself helped to optimize the model's hyperparameters, which improved the model's ability to generalize to new data. By exhaustively testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters, the grid search process helped to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters that balanced model complexity and predictive performance.

Overall, the combination of stratified random sampling, cross-validation, and grid search helped to ensure the generalizability of the machine learning model. However, it is worth noting that the provided context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset as a measure to ensure generalizability.
