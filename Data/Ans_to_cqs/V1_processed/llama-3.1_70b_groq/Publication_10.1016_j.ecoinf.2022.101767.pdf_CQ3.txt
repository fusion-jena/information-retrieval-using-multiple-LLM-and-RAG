Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions the classification of thumbnail characteristics into six categories (people, birds, objects, scenery, text, and food) and the use of R software with various packages for data analysis. It does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used for object detection or image segmentation. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
