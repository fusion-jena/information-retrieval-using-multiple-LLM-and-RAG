To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the training dataset was designed to contain sufficient variation to capture the broad range of contexts that the CNN is required for. This was achieved by photographing the animals across different times of the day and in different lighting conditions.

Additionally, the model was trained on a large dataset with a significant number of images for each species. For example, 1,600 images of each zebra finch were randomly selected without filtering for near-identical images. This helped to ensure that the model was exposed to a diverse range of images and was not biased towards a particular subset of images.

The use of a small batch size (eight pictures provided to the model each time) was also employed to improve the model's generalization capability. It has been shown that small batch sizes can improve models' generalization capability (Masters & Luschi, 2018).

Furthermore, the model was trained using the VGG19 CNN architecture, which is a pre-trained network on the ImageNet dataset (a dataset with more than 14 million images). This pre-training on a large and diverse dataset helped to improve the model's generalizability.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to evaluate the model's performance.
