The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the method design and deep learning technology allow for the processing of large datasets and have the potential for transfer to other forest regions due to on-the-fly data acquisition and processing capability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the diversity of tree species was reduced in smaller spatial scales, and the accuracy decreased at smaller spatial scales. This suggests that the model was tested on different scales, but it does not provide information on how the data was split or if cross-validation was used.

It is also mentioned that the method is applicable for other scales (50 × 50 m, 90 × 90 m, etc.), depending on the quadrat size in the field work or the requirements of species diversity estimation. This suggests that the model was designed to be flexible and adaptable to different scales, but it does not provide information on how the data was split or if cross-validation was used.

The context does mention that it is beneficial to collect tree samples with the aid of crowd sourcing, which could potentially increase the diversity of the dataset. However, it does not provide information on how the data was collected or if any measures were taken to ensure that the dataset was representative of the population.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
