Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including data preparation, model architecture (DeepLabV3+), and training parameters (e.g., learning rate reduction, batch size, and data augmentation). It also discusses the evaluation of the model on different datasets and the impact of various parameters on the model's performance.

However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related details. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
