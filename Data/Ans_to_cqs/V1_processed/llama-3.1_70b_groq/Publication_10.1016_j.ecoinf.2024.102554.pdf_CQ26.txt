Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring, discussing data acquisition, calibration, and fusion from various satellite instruments. It does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques mentioned in the query. Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are indeed techniques used to address data bias and imbalance in machine learning pipelines, including deep learning. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into subsets based on the class labels to maintain the same proportion of samples in each subset. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the data. Undersampling involves reducing the number of majority class samples to balance the data. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation.

But, I don't know if these techniques are specifically used in the context of the provided text.
