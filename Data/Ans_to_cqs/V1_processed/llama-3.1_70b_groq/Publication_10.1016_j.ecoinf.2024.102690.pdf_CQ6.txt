Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm for identifying ecological sources and analyzing ecosystem services, but it does not provide information on deep learning model training or preprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the use of the R package kohonen for implementing the SOFM algorithm, but it does not provide details on any preprocessing steps that may be involved.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
