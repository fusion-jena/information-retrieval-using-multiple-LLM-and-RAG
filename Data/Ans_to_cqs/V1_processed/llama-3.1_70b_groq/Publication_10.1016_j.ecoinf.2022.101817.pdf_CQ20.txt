Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance metrics of various hardware platforms, such as HPD 1, HPD 2, Nvidia Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4, and MediaTek Pumpkin i500, in terms of their processing efficiency, power consumption, and cost. It also discusses the evaluation parameters for the CNN models, including precision, recall, and F1 score.

However, it can be inferred that the training of the deep learning model is not the primary focus of the provided context, as it does not mention any specific hardware resources used for training. The context seems to be more focused on the deployment and evaluation of the trained models on various hardware platforms.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
