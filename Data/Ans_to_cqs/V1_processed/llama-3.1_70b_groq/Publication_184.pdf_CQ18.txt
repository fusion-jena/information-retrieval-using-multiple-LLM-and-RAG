The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is monitored through the calculation of certain metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). The context mentions that the model's performance is evaluated using these metrics, and the results are used to determine the optimal number of epochs and to identify overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions that the loss is monitored during training, and it is observed that the loss shows a rapid decline around 1000 iterations. This suggests that the model's performance is also monitored through the loss function.

However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training, such as using a validation set or a test set, is not mentioned in the provided context.
