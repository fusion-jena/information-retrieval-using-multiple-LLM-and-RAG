The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation and the use of flattened convolution kernels, which suggests that some form of preprocessing may have been performed.

Additionally, the context mentions the preparation of data, including the extraction of training samples from ground truth images, but it does not provide further details on the specific preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
