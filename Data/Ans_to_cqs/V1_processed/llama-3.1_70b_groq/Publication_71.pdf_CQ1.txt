Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, a deep learning model for image segmentation, and discusses some challenges associated with deep learning methods, such as imbalanced datasets and the requirement for a vast amount of training data.

However, it does mention that augmenting the training dataset using different techniques, such as adding vertically and horizontally flipped versions, shifting, rotating, or adding noisy versions of the training images, could be potential strategies to improve the performance of deep learning methods. This suggests that the context assumes the availability of a dataset, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
