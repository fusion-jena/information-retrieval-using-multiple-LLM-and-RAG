Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning-based denoising methods to bioacoustics, the challenges associated with these methods, and the comparison of traditional and deep learning-based approaches.

However, it does mention that deep learning-based denoising methods often use a U-net architecture, which consists of an encoder and decoder section. The encoder produces a compressed latent space representation, and the decoder uses this latent space to reconstruct the denoised waveform. Additionally, transformer attention mechanisms have been applied with great success in some studies.

While the context does not provide specific information on regularization methods, it does highlight the challenges associated with training deep learning models, such as the need for large amounts of data and the difficulty of collecting clean data for fine-tuning. These challenges may be addressed through various regularization techniques, but the specific methods used are not mentioned in the provided context.
