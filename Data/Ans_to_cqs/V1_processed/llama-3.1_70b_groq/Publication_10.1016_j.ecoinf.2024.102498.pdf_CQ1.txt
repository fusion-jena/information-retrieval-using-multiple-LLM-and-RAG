Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite data and satellite imagery, which suggests that remote sensing data may be one source of raw data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine, which is a platform that provides access to a vast repository of satellite and other Earth observation data. It is likely that this data is used as input for the deep learning models, but the exact methods of data collection are not specified.
