The text mentions several deep learning models used for object detection, specifically:

* Cascade RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)
* FCOS (Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection)
* Sparse CNN (Sparse Convolutional Neural Network)
* Faster RCNN (Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)
* ATSS (Adaptive Training Sample Selection)
* RetinaNet
* RepPoints (Representative Points)

All of these models are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided text.
