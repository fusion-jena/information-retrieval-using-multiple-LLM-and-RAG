I don't know. The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to focus on a study related to predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, specifically addressing the issue of structurally incomplete target labels. It discusses various approaches to handling incomplete data, including baseline approaches and a partial imputation algorithm, but does not provide information on the generalizability of a deep learning model.
