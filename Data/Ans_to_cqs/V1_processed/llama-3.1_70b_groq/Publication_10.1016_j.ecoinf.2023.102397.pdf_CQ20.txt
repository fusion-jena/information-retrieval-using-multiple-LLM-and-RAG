I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the effects of sample size and network depth on a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling, as well as the performance of acoustic indices as proxies for bird diversity. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs or TPUs.
