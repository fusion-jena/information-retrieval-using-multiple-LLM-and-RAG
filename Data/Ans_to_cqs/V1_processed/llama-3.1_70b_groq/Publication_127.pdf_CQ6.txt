Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on various deep learning architectures, their performance, and related research papers. It does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it does mention the creation of a dataset by selecting 757,000 nonempty images and randomly selecting 757,000 empty images, which was then split into training and test sets. This suggests that some form of data preparation or preprocessing was involved, but the specific steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
