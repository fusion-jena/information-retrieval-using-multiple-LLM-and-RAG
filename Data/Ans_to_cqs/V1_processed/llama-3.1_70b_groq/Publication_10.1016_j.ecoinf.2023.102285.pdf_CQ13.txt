Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the model is a deep learning (DL) model and that it is compared to a non-supervised technique and a machine learning (ML) approach, but it does not provide any details about the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
