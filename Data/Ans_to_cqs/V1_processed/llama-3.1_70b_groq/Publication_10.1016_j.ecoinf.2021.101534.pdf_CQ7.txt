Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as the proportions for training, testing, and validation sets. The context only discusses the preprocessing steps, including audio standardization, segmentation, augmentation, and spectrogram conversion, but does not provide information on data splitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
