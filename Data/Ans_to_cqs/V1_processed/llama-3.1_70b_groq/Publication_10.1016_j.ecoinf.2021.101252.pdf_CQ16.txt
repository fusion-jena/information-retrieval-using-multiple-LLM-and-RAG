The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation performance (Bv). Specifically, training is stopped if no increase in validation performance is observed after 25 epochs. This means that if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve after 25 epochs, the training process is considered complete. The model with the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) in predicting the validation performance is then selected and used to classify the test data.
