Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the training process, including the loss function, optimization algorithm (Stochastic Gradient Descent), and the design of the training dataset. It also mentions some related research papers and references, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
