Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context only mentions that the dataset was "manually annotated" (Section 2.1. Digitization and annotation), but it does not provide further details on the annotation techniques employed. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
