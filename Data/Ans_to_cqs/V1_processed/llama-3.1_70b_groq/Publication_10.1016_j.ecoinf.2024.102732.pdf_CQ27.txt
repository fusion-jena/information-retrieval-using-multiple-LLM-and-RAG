Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to machine learning, ecology, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a specific deep learning model.

The context does mention various machine learning algorithms and techniques, such as neural networks, logistic regression, and gradient boosted trees, but it does not discuss the deployment process. It also mentions various performance metrics, such as MAE, RMSE, and parameters, but again, it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query, and I must say that I don't know the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
