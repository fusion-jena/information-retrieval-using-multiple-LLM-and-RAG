Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and remote sensing techniques for land use and land cover classification, invasive species detection, and biodiversity monitoring.

However, it does mention the use of hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data, as well as the application of deep learning techniques for land use and land cover classification. It also mentions the use of scikit-learn and scikit-image libraries for machine learning and image processing tasks.

But, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
