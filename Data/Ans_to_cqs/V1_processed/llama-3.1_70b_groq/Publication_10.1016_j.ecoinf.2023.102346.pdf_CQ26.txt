Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning applications in microbiology and species distribution modeling, with references to various R packages and statistical analysis methods.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are indeed common techniques used to handle imbalanced datasets and reduce bias. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into subsets based on the class labels, ensuring that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of majority class samples.

Diverse data collection is also an important technique to address data bias, as it involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and populations to ensure that the dataset is representative of the problem being modeled.

It's worth noting that the context does mention ensemble modeling approaches, which can also help to reduce bias by combining the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data. However, this is not a specific technique for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, I can provide some general information on common techniques used in machine learning.
