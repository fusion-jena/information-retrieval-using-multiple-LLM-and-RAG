The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the classification accuracy of software incorporating an informative prior in their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing data sets alone. The performance must also be evaluated through the number of correct classifications using real-world examples. This suggests that the model performance is evaluated using a combination of metrics, including accuracy on test data and real-world examples, but the specific strategy used during training is not specified.
