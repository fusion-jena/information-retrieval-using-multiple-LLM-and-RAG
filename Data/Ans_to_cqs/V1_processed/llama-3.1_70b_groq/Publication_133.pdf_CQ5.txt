The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the trap images and associated programming code are available online at http://meshi1.cs.bgu.ac.il/FIE2020_data. Additionally, it references external links, including https://www.gbif.org, https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/v4.0, and https://cocodataset.org/#home, which may be related to the datasets used. But without further information, it is unclear if these links are directly related to the datasets used in the pipeline.
