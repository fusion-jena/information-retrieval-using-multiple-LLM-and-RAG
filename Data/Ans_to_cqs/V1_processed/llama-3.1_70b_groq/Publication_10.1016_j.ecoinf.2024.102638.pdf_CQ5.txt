Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on earth system science, remote sensing, and machine learning applications, with references to various research papers and datasets related to these fields.

However, it does mention the use of a dataset with various features such as soil moisture, pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and more, which is used for training and testing machine learning models. The specific name of this dataset is not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
