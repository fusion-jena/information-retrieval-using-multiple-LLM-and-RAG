The postprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, the model was trained using a 60-20-20 train/validate/test regime,, split the data into training and validation sets. This suggests that the model was trained using a supervised learning approach. After the model training, the model was converted to TensorFlow Lite, The model was then deployed on edge devices for inference. The model was then used for inference edge prediction) and the accuracy was evaluated.
