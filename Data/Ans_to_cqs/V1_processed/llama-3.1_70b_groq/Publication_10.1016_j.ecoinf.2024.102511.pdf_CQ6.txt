Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the importance of having significant sample sizes for all classes and the need for tools to enhance or combine disparate datasets.

It mentions the concept of data augmentation, citing a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning by Shorten et al. (2019). While this survey is focused on image data, it suggests that data augmentation techniques might be relevant for other types of data as well.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep neural networks for bioacoustic classification, which implies that the data might require some form of preprocessing, such as normalization or scaling, to be suitable for training a deep learning model.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a detailed answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
