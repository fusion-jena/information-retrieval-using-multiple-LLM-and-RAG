Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context only discusses the loss function used, which is a combination of binary cross-entropy and Dice coefficient-related loss, and the optimizer used, which is RMSprop with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. It does not provide information on any regularization techniques employed.
