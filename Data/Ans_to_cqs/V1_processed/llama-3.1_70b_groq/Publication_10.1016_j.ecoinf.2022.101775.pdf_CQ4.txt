Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context appears to focus on the use of embedding layers, matrix factorization, and deep matrix factorization for handling sparse data and recovering missing information in sensor networks. It also discusses the training process and hyperparameters used for the algorithms, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
