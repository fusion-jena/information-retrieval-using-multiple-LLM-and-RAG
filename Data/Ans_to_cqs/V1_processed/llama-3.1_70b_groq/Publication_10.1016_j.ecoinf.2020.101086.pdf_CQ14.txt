Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the parameterization of the correction methods, the performance of different methods, and the evaluation of the results, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
