The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to analyze the performance of the model. 

In the context of the proposed model, the performance is evaluated using these metrics for different bird species and training-testing split ratios. The results are presented in tables, which suggests that the model's performance is being monitored and compared across different scenarios. 

However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training, such as validation loss or accuracy, is not mentioned in the provided context.
