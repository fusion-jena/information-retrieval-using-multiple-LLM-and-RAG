Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the development of a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation using deep neural networks, but it does not provide information on the data collection process. It mentions the use of underwater stereo images, but it does not elaborate on how these images are obtained. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this context.
