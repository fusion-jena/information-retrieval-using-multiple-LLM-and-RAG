Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on bat calls detection and classification using convolutional neural networks, as well as statistical computing and geographic information systems.

However, I can suggest that the context does mention the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for bat calls detection and classification, which may involve regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. But the specific methods used are not mentioned in the provided context.

If you're looking for information on regularization methods, I'd be happy to provide general information on the topic. But based on the provided context, I don't have enough information to provide a specific answer to your question.
