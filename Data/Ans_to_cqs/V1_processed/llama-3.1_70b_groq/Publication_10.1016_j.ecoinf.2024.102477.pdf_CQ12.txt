The deep learning models used in the pipeline are RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), specifically SLSTM (Seasonal Long Short-Term Memory) and SGRU (Seasonal Gated Recurrent Unit) models. These models are used for time-series prediction and are extensions of traditional LSTM and GRU models, with additional components to handle seasonal data.
