The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that the confusion matrix for the best model (VGG) is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S10. This suggests that a confusion matrix is one of the postprocessing steps involved.

Additionally, the context mentions that the accuracy of the models is calculated and reported in Table 2. This implies that metrics calculation is another postprocessing step involved.

There is no mention of saliency maps or any other postprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, we can only confirm that metrics calculation and confusion matrix are two of the postprocessing steps involved, but we do not know about other potential steps.
