Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Earth observation data, specifically Sentinel-2, which suggests that satellite imagery might be one of the data sources used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of ground truth samples, which implies that some form of field data collection or surveys might be involved.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of existing datasets, such as the Wetland Delineation and Characterization Layers 2014-2017, Rwanda, which suggests that public datasets might also be utilized.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. The context does not provide enough details on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
