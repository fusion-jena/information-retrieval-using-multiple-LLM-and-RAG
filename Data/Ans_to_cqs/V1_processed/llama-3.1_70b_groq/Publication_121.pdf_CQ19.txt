The frameworks used to build the deep learning model are TensorFlow and Keras. According to the provided context, the software tools used for model training include Anaconda3 Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.8, where the TensorFlow, OpenCV-python3, and Keras libraries were used. Additionally, the model was converted into the TensorFlow Lite version using the TensorFlow Lite converter for deployment on smartphone and IoT devices.
