The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

1. FishInTurbidWater dataset: This is a custom dataset collected for the purpose of developing deep learning models for underwater fish video processing in turbid waters. The dataset is weakly labeled.

2. ImageNet dataset: This is a large, open-source, fully-labeled dataset used for pre-training two deep neural networks (DNNs), EfficientNet and ViT, using transfer learning. ImageNet is a huge visual dataset with fourteen million images, designed for object recognition tasks.

Note that there is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets in the provided context.
