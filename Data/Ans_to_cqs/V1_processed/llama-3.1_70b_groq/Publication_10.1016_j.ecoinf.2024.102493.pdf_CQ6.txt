The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. However, it does describe the preprocessing steps involved in preparing the NDVI dataset for analysis.

According to the context, the preprocessing steps for the NDVI dataset include:

1. Proportional scaling: dividing each pixel's original value by a scale factor of 10,000.
2. Projection transformations: utilizing the WGS1984-Albers projected coordinate system.
3. Mask extraction: based on watershed boundaries, which were extracted from the ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2 hydrological analysis toolbox.

It is not clear if these preprocessing steps are also applicable to training a deep learning model. Additionally, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models such as normalization, cleaning, and feature scaling are not mentioned in the provided context.
