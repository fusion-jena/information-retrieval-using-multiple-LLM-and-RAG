The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does mention that the optimizer RMSprop is used with an initial learning rate of 0.0001, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are searched or optimized. 

It is mentioned that the model was trained for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch, but this is more related to the training process rather than hyperparameter optimization. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide enough information to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
