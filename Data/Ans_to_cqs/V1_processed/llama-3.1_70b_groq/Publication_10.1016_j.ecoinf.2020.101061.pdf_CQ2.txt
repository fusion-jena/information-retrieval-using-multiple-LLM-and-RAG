The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses image data, specifically RGB images, as the input for the neural network. This is evident from the mention of "RGB-based tree identification" and "RGB channels" in the text. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
