The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE). According to the provided context, models were trained until the validation MAE did not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverged from the training MAE, which is referred to as 'overfit'. This indicates that the training process stops when the model's performance on the validation dataset stops improving and starts to overfit the training data.
