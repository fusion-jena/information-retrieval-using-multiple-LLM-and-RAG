Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the architecture of the proposed species identification system, including the layers and kernel sizes, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It mentions the performance of the model, including the accuracy and training time, but it does not discuss the methods used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
