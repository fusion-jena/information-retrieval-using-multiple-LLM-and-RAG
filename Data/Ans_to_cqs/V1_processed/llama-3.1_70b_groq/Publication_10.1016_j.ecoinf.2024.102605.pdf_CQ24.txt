Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be a collection of academic paper references and snippets related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not specifically address the topic of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
