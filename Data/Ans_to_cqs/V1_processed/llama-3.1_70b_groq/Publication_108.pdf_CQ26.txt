The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data (orthophoto and corresponding labels) were split into three datasets: training (80%), validation (20%), and test (two full images of 10,000 Ã— 10,000 pixels). This suggests that a simple random splitting was used, but it does not provide information on whether any techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used to address data bias.

It does mention that an in-depth investigation of the performance of the proposed architecture on further datasets would be an interesting future project, especially with respect to the power of generalization, which can be increased by different data augmentation techniques. This implies that data augmentation techniques might be used in the future to address data bias and improve the model's generalization, but it does not provide information on whether any such techniques were used in the current study.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
