The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and precision. 

Accuracy is defined as the proportion of correctly classified signals, which is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of signals (N). The formula for accuracy is: accuracy = [TP + TN]/N.

Precision is defined as the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, which is calculated as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the sum of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP). The formula for precision is: precision = TP/[TP + FP].

The values of these metrics are reported as follows: accuracy = 98.0% and precision = 98.4%. 

Note that recall is not mentioned in the provided context as one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
