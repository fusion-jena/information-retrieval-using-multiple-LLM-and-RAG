I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of authors and their contributions to a research paper or project. It does not contain any information about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context only mentions tasks such as writing, review, editing, supervision, investigation, data curation, and project administration, but it does not provide any details about the deployment process of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
