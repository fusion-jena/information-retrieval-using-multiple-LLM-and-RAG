According to the provided context, the STARdbi pipeline utilizes sticky traps to collect flying insects. The traps are covered with transparent acetate sheets, and then high-resolution scanning of the traps is performed using an office scanner. This method is used to collect raw data in the form of images, which are then uploaded to the STARdbi database along with their metadata (time of placement and removal, location, scanning resolution, etc.). 

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. The focus is on the use of sticky traps and scanning technology to collect images of insects, which are then used for automatic detection and analysis using machine learning models.
