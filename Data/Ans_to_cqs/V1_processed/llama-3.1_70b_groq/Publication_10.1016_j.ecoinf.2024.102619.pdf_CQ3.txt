Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the importance of accurate and reliable annotations, the trade-off between error-rate and efficiency, and the complexity of data management and feature extraction in the CNN approach.

However, it does mention the use of annotation software such as BIIGLE, VIAME, and CoralNet, which may incorporate automatic classification tools. But it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used in these software.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
