The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text discusses the use of deep learning methods for plant species identification, the development of a mobile app for tree species identification, and the results of the study. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

The text does mention the use of a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.5 and momentum of 0.9, which is a common optimization algorithm used in deep learning. However, it does not provide information on how the random seed value is set or handled.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
