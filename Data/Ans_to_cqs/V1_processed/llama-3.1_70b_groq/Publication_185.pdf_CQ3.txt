Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the feasibility of using small datasets to train deep learning models, the architecture of AlexNet, and the training process. It also mentions some related research papers and publications, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
