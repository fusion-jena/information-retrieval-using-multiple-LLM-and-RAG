The provided context mentions the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, it mentions data augmentation as another technique used in combination with the ResNet-50 network architecture and transfer learning. However, it does not mention L2 regularization specifically. Therefore, based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are dropout and data augmentation.
