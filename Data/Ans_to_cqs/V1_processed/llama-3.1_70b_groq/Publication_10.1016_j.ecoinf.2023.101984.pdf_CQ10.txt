I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of academic papers and their references, with no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The papers seem to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution, and vegetation history, but there is no information about a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
