The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the training loss and training accuracy are plotted in figures (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9), and the validation accuracy is also plotted (Fig. 10). This suggests that the model performance is monitored through the tracking of these metrics during training.
