The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that "the kernel could be chosen randomly" in the context of convolution operations. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the selection of kernels, but it does not provide information on how this randomness is controlled or managed.

In the context of deep learning, setting a random seed value is a common strategy for ensuring reproducibility of results. However, this is not mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.

It is worth noting that the text does discuss the use of multiple kernels to obtain random feature maps, which may help to reduce the impact of randomness in the model. However, this is not a direct answer to the query, and I do not have enough information to provide a more detailed response.
