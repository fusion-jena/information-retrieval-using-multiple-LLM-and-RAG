Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions "Data collection" as a step in the process (Section 2.1), but it does not provide further details on the methods used for collecting data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
