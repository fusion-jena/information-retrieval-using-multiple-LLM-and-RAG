I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper about forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis using deep learning methods, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in the pipeline. The context mentions the use of LSTM models and Bayesian optimization, but it does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
