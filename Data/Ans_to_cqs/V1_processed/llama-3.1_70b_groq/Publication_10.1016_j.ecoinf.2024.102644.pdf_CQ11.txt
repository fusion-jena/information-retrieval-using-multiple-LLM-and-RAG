I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It mentions the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a public authoritative repository of big data, but it does not provide a link to a specific deep learning pipeline. The context also mentions other data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, and Dryad, but it does not provide a link to any of them in relation to a deep learning pipeline.
