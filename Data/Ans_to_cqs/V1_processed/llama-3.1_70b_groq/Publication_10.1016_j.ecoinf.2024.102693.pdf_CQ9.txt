I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing various deep learning models, including CNN-like and transformer-like models, and their performance on a specific dataset (IP102). However, it does not provide information on where the data or the pipeline is stored.
