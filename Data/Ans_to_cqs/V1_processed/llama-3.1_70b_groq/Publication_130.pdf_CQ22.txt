The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for accuracy and loss. 

It is mentioned that the validation dataset is used to compute the accuracy and loss (estimation of the error during training) of the model. Additionally, it is stated that if there was no decrease in loss for more than 10 consecutive epochs, the training was stopped, and the model that achieved the lowest loss was retrained. 

However, other common metrics such as precision and recall are not mentioned in the provided context.
