Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on valve gaping in shellfish, with discussions on data analysis, clustering, and environmental variables. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is mentioned that the gaping data was averaged over 5 minutes in the Venice Lagoon and over 1 minute in the Wadden Sea, and then used as input in the analysis. Additionally, the environmental variables (temperature, saturation, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a) were rescaled for clustering analysis. But these steps are not directly related to preprocessing for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
