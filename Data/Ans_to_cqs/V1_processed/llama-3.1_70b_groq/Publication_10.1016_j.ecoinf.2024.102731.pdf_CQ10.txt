I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological topics, including green infrastructure, land cover, and habitat suitability models. There is no mention of a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
