The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, is classification. The main objective of the work mentioned in the context is to create a model that accurately identifies sika deer using the ViT concept. This suggests that the model is designed for classification tasks, where the goal is to classify images into different categories (in this case, identifying sika deer).
