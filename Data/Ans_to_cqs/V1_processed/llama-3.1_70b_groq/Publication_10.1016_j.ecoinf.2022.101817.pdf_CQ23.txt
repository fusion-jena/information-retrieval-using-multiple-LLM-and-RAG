The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the validation performance of the CNN model was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which suggests that some form of validation was performed. Additionally, the text mentions that the confusion matrix was generated during the "cross-validation phase" of the designed CNN models, which implies that cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. However, no further details are provided about the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability.
