Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from research papers related to machine learning and deep learning, but it does not include information about where the data repository is hosted.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. If you're looking for the data repository, I recommend checking the original research papers or contacting the authors directly to inquire about the location of the repository.
