Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on wetlands in East Africa, using Sentinel-2 satellite data, and discusses the use of a 2010 spatial dataset and a comparison with a 2017 ministerial order. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
