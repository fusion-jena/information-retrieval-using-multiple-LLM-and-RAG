The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, specifically bounding box estimation and classification. The model is trained to predict the coordinates and dimensions of bounding boxes around objects in images, as well as the class probabilities of the objects within those boxes. This is evident from the mention of YOLO (You Only Look Once) loss function, which is a common loss function used in object detection tasks. The model is also trained to predict class probabilities, as indicated by the mention of classification loss (cls loss) and cross-entropy loss function. Additionally, the use of Intersection over Union (IoU) and distributional focal loss (DFL) suggests that the model is designed to detect objects and predict their bounding boxes accurately.
