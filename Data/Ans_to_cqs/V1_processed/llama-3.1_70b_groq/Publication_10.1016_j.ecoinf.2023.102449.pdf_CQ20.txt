Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text discusses the architecture of the model, the use of techniques such as batch normalization and UMAP, and the application of the model to ecoacoustic representation learning, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
