The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Rotations: The input images were rotated randomly between 0-360 degrees.
2. Flipping: The input images were flipped horizontally and vertically.
3. Changes in brightness: The brightness of the input images was changed by modulating the current values between 95-110%.
4. Changes in saturation: The saturation of the input images was changed by modulating the current values between 95-105%.
5. Changes in hue: The hue of the input images was changed by modulating the current values between 99-101%.

These data augmentation techniques were applied randomly to the input images. There is no mention of scaling as a data augmentation technique in the provided context.
