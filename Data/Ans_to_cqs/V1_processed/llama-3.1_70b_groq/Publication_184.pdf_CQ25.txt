The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of bounding box data and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, a popular real-time object detection system. The model is trained to detect fish in images, with the class of the object (fish) and the bounding box data (x, y coordinates, width, and height) provided as correct answers. The model's performance is evaluated based on metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision, which are commonly used in object detection tasks.
