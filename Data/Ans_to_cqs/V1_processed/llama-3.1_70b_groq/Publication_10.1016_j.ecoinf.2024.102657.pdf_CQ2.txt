The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Audio (.wav): The original bird song recordings are in .wav format.
2. Image: The audio files are converted into spectrograms, which are images representing the frequency and time characteristics of the audio signals. These images are used as input to the CNN.
3. CSV: A metadata .csv file is created to store the classification information for training the CNN and k-NN. This file contains five columns, including the file path to the folder containing the bird song, dialect type, and year it was collected.

Note that video is not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline.
