Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The context only mentions the software tools and libraries used, including Python, Theano, Lasagne, and Librosa. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
