Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on various topics, including IoT-enabled environment monitoring systems, sentimental short sentence classification, and matrix factorization for recovering corrupted data in sensor networks.

However, it does mention the use of embedding layers in deep neural networks, particularly in natural language processing problems and collaborative filtering. Embedding layers are used to solve the one-hot encoding problem, where sparse representations are replaced with dense vectors. But this is not directly related to data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
