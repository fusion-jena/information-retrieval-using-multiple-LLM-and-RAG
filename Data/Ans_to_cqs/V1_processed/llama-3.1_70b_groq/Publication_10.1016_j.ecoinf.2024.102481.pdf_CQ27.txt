Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text discusses the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forests (RF), in classifying maturity in Chilean hake, but it does not provide information on model deployment. It only mentions the use of ML algorithms to model complex relationships in ecology, genetics, and climate change, and their potential to improve biological understanding in future or retrospective research. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
