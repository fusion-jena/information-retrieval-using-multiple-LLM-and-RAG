Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It mentions that the biodiversity monitoring application is a prime candidate for application of DL due to the availability of large amounts of labeled data produced by the analysts using their UI. However, it does not provide information on how the dataset was handled to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset.
