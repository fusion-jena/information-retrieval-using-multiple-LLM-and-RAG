Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on machine learning and deep learning models for river health predictions, ecological informatics, and ensemble methods, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

However, it's worth noting that the context does mention the use of machine learning and deep learning models for river health predictions, which may involve data annotation techniques such as labeling or categorizing data. For example, the paper by Zamri et al. (2023) mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning models for river quality assessment, but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques used.

In general, data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are commonly used in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and image segmentation. However, without more specific information, it's unclear whether these techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline for river health predictions.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
