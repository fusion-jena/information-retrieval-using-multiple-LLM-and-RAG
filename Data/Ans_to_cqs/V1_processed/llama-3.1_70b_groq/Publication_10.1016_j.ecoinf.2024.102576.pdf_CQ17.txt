Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information, but it does not delve into the specifics of the regularization techniques used.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-Net models, which are commonly used in image classification tasks. These models often employ regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

If I had to make an educated guess, I would say that the deep learning pipeline might employ techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, as these are common techniques used in deep learning models. However, without explicit mention in the context, I cannot provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, my answer is that I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
