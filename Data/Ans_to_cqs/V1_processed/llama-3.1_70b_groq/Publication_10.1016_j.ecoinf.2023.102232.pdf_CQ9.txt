Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does mention that "All the scripts and dataset to fully reproduce the results of this work are publicly available at https://github.com/lucaros1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo." This suggests that the data and scripts are available on GitHub, but it does not specify if they are also available on other repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
