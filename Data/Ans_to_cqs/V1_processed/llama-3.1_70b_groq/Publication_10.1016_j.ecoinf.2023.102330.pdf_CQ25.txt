The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is detection. The context mentions the development of a CNN for the automatic detection of Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus covey calls, indicating that the model is designed to detect specific sounds or calls. Additionally, the text mentions the use of the CNN to detect the target species of interest, further supporting the idea that the model's purpose is detection.
