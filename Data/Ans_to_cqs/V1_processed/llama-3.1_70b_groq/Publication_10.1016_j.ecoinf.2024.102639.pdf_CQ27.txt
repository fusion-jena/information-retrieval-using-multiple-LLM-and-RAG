Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning methodologies in animal behavior studies, the selection of distance metrics, and the training of an SVM model on a dimensionally reduced dataset. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
