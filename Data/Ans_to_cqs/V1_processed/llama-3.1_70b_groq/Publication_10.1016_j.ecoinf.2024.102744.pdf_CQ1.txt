Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and evaluation of deep learning models for bee image classification and pollen-bearing bee detection, rather than data collection.

However, it can be inferred that the models are trained on existing datasets, such as the VnPollenBee dataset, which is mentioned in the context. Additionally, some of the references cited in the context, such as [31] and [32], may provide more information on data collection methods used in their respective studies.

But based on the provided context alone, it is not possible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
