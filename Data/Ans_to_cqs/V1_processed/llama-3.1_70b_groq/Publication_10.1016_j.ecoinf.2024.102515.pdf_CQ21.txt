Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily discusses the limitations of the methodology, the importance of location information for biodiversity observations, and the availability of a training dataset. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
