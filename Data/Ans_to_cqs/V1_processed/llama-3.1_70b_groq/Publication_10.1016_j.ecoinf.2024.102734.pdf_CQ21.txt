Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The text primarily focuses on the annotation process, model selection, and training, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention that the user can "view training metrics through the training tab," which suggests that some form of metrics calculation is performed after model training. Additionally, the text reports the performance of the models on the validation and test datasets, which implies that some form of evaluation is conducted after training.

Regarding saliency maps and confusion matrices, there is no mention of these specific postprocessing steps in the provided context. It is possible that these steps are performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the text.

Therefore, I can only confirm that metrics calculation is likely performed after model training, but I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
