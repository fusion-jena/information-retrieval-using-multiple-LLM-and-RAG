Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the architecture of the deep learning model, including the use of pre-trained CNN architectures such as Inception, Residual Neural Network (Resnet), and Dense Convolutional Network (Densenet). It also mentions the loss function used for training the CNN detection network, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a loss function L in equation (1), which includes a classification loss term (Lcls) and a regression loss term (Lreg). The classification loss term is averaged over the number of classes (Ncls), and the regression loss term is averaged over the number of regression targets (Nreg). While this loss function may include regularization terms, the context does not provide explicit information on the regularization methods used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
