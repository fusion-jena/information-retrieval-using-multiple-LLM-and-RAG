The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models (LM, GLM, and ANN) was evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute difference, and mean deviance.

For the LM model, the R-squared value on the training data was 0.81, and the mean absolute difference on the test data was 1.85. Similarly, for the GLM approach, the artificial R-squared on the training data was 0.81, and the mean absolute deviance on the test data was 1.79. For the ANN model, the mean deviance of the model response from SPAD value measurements was 1.904 (95% CI: 1.89â€“1.92).

It appears that the performance of the models was evaluated using a combination of metrics, including goodness of fit measures (R-squared) and error metrics (mean absolute difference, mean deviance). However, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated.
