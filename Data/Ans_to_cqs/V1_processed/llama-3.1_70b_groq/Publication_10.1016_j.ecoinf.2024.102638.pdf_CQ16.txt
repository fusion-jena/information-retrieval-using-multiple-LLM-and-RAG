Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the process of hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with a five-fold cross-validation and the negative mean square error as the target measure. It also discusses the evaluation of performance metrics using a designated test set and the selection of the most effective models based on those metrics.

However, it does mention that the hyperparameter tuning process is performed within the confines of the training set, aiming to enhance the predictive performance of the models. But it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
