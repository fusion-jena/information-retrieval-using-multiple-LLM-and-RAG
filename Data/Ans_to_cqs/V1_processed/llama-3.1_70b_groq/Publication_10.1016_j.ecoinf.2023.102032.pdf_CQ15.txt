I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to a study on wetland use intensity in East Africa using Sentinel-2 data and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. It discusses the use of the s2cloudless algorithm for cloud detection and masking, but does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques.
