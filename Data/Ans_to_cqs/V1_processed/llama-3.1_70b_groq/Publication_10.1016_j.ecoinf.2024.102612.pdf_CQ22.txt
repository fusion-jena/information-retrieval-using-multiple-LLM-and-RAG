The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Overall Accuracy, IoU (Intersection over Union), Mean Accuracy (MA), and Mean IoU (MIoU). These metrics are used to assess the classification performance of the model, with Mean IoU being used to determine the point at which the model attains optimal performance.
