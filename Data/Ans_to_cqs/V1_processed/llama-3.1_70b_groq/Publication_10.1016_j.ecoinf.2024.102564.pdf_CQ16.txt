The provided context does not mention specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. It only mentions the configuration of essential parameters in the RF training, the performance metrics used to assess the models, and the k-fold cross-validation method used for evaluation. It also describes the training of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a multilayer perceptron, but does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
