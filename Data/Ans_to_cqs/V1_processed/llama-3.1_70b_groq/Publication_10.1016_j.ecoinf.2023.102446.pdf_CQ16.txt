I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training, validation loss, or plateau. It appears to be discussing data collection and processing, specifically in the context of a study on carbon uptake by plants. The text mentions data gaps, time series analysis, and the relationship between vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and carbon assimilation, but it does not provide any information about training or validation criteria.
