Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a collection of references and citations related to various topics such as optogenetics, machine learning, and event-stream processing, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.

Some of the references mention machine learning methods and tools, such as Apache Kibana and Elasticsearch, but they do not discuss hyperparameter optimization specifically. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.
