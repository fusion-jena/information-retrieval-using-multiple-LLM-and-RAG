I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing species distribution modeling (SDM) and methods for correcting sampling bias in presence-only data. The context mentions techniques for transforming model input data, such as modifying the presence dataset to tend towards a uniform distribution, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
