Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and training of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, including the optimization objective, network architecture, and regularization techniques. It does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and assist further.
