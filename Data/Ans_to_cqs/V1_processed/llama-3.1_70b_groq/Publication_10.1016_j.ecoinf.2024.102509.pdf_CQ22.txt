The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the AGBpred prediction models, which include:

* Adjusted R2 (Adjusted coefficient of determination)
* MSE (Mean squared error)
* AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
* BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Additionally, the context mentions the use of SOC values of the validation dataset to analyze the relative effectiveness of the models. It also mentions the use of R2 and MSE to evaluate the performance of the ANN models.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models. These metrics are commonly used in classification problems, but the context suggests that the models are used for regression tasks, such as predicting above-ground biomass.
