Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the EfficientNetV2 series, bottleneck transformers, and other related concepts, but it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps.

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, common preprocessing steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model stability and convergence.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing or imputing missing values, and correcting data entry errors.

It's essential to note that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture. Without more information, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

If you're looking for more information on preprocessing steps, I recommend consulting additional resources or the specific documentation for the deep learning framework or library you're using.
