The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the references to species distribution modeling, ecological niche models, and the evaluation metrics used (AUC-ROC, Cohen's KAPPA, and Continuous Boyce Index), it appears that the deep learning model is likely used for classification tasks, specifically for predicting the presence or absence of species in a given area. The context mentions the use of algorithms such as MaxEnt, Random Forest, and SVM, which are commonly used for classification tasks in species distribution modeling. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
