The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of permutation importance and jackknife analysis. According to the provided context, permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is reevaluated on the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages. This approach allows for the evaluation of the model's performance and the contribution of each variable to the model. Additionally, the context mentions that the model's output was analyzed using maximum iterations with the subsample run type and a 30 random test percentage, which suggests that the model's performance was also evaluated using a subsampling approach.
