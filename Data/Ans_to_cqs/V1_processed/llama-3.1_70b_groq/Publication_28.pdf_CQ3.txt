Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning approaches and architectures for satellite image classification, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and distributed deep learning methods.

However, it can be inferred that the datasets used for training these models require some form of annotation. For example, the context mentions the use of CNNs for image classification, which typically requires annotated data in the form of class labels. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Apache Spark for distributed deep learning, which may involve annotating large datasets in parallel.

Some of the papers mentioned in the context, such as Liu et al. (2020) and Zhang et al. (2016), discuss the use of deep learning for satellite image classification, but they do not provide details on the data annotation techniques used. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.

If more information about the specific datasets or papers is provided, it may be possible to infer the data annotation techniques used. However, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
