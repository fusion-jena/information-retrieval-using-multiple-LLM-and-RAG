The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does describe a two-step process for estimating model parameters, which involves a combination of least squares methods via genetic algorithms and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach.

The genetic algorithm is used to partially optimize the results of the estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. The algorithm generates four random combinations of initial values from the first quarter of values stored in a Python dictionary, and each new combination of best fit values is stored in the database. The rows of the database are then ordered according to the values of the sum of the residual.

While this process can be seen as a form of optimization, it is not explicitly stated as a hyperparameter optimization method such as grid search or random search. The context suggests that the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the model parameters, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
