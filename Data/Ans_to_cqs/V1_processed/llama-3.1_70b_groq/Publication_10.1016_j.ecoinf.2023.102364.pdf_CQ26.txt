Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Short-billed Gulls using machine learning ensemble predictions, geographic information systems (GIS), and socio-economic data. It discusses various machine learning algorithms such as RandomForest, CART, and MARS regression splines, but does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
