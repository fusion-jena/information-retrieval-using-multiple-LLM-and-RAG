Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context only mentions the use of Sentinel-2 images and GEDI data, which are used to create high-resolution CHM (Canopy Height Model) datasets, such as Lang10m and Potapov30m. These datasets are specific to the application of forest ecosystem monitoring and are not related to the typical datasets used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks.
