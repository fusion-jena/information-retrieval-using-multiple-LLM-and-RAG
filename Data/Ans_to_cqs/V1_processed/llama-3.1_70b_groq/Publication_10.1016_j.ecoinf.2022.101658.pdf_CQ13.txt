Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context provides information about the study's methodology, field measurements, and the use of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation, but it does not provide details about the specific hyperparameters used in the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
