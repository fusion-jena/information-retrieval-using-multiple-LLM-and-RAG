Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to image processing and analysis, specifically in the context of mycelium detection and filamentous structure analysis. It discusses various methods for image segmentation, thresholding, and validation, but does not touch on the topic of training completion criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
