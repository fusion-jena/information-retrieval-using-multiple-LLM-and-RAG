I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of academic papers and research studies related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental science. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context seems to be focused on research papers and studies, and does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
