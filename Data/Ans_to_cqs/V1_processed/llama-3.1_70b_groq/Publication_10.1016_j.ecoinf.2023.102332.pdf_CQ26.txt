Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on natural language processing (NLP) methods, text mining, and word embedding techniques, such as Word2vec, for analyzing social media data and cultural ecosystem services.

However, it does mention that training a new custom word2vec model could be biased by the geographic origin of the data, which suggests that data bias is a consideration in the context. Nevertheless, it does not provide specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
