The provided context does not specifically address techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various machine learning methods, including classical and deep learning approaches, that can be used to generate synthetic data. These methods include regression, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN).

While these methods can be used to generate synthetic data, they do not directly address data bias during preprocessing. However, some of the mentioned methods, such as oversampling and undersampling, can be used to address class imbalance issues, which is a type of data bias.

The context also mentions the use of synthetic data to evaluate the performance of a model, but it does not provide specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only mention that oversampling and undersampling might be used to address class imbalance issues, but I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
