Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in LaDeco. The context primarily focuses on the functionality, architecture, and computational efficiency of the platform, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

However, it is mentioned that the platform uses a semantic segmentation algorithm (DeepLabv3) and a ResNet neural network (ResNet269), which are commonly evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and intersection over union (IoU). But without explicit mention in the context, it is unclear which specific metrics are used in LaDeco.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
