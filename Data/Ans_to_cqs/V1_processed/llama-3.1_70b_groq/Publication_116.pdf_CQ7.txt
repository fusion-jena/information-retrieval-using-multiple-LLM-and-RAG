The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the deep learning experiment. However, it does mention that the second experiment is similar to the first one, which is the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment. 

In the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment, the data is split into training and testing datasets. The biased dataset is created by randomly taking 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing, but this is done at the species level, not the specimen level. This means that all images of a given specimen are either used for training or for testing. 

It is not clear if the same criteria is used for the deep learning experiment, or if a validation set is used in addition to the training and testing sets.
