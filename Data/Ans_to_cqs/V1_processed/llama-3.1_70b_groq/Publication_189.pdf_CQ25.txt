The purpose of the deep learning model is instance segmentation, which is a combination of object detection and semantic segmentation. The model is designed to detect objects in an image and also segment each object instance, providing a pixel-level mask for each object. This is achieved through the use of Mask R-CNN, a model that combines the strengths of Faster R-CNN and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). The model is trained to predict both the class label and the mask for each object instance in the image.
