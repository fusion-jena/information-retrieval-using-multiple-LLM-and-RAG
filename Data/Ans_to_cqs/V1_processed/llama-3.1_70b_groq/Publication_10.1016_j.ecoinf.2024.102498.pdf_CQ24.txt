Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It highlights the advantages of deep learning, including automatic feature extraction, adaptability to evolving patterns, and compatibility with new situations through transfer learning.

However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness or provide information on strategies for managing random seed values. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this query.
