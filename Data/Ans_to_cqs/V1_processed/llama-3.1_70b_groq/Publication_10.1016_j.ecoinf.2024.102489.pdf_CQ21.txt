Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context only discusses the preparation of the training data, the training of the Random Forest (RF) model, and the selection of feature variables. It does not provide information on the evaluation or analysis of the model's performance after training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
