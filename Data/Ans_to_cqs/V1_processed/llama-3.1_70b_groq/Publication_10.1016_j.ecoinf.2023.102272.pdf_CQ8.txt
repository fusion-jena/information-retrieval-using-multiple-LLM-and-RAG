Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the use of the "mcfly" and "deepnet" R packages, and provides a link to the CRAN repository for the "deepnet" package. However, it does not provide information on where the code for the specific pipeline used in the study is hosted. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
