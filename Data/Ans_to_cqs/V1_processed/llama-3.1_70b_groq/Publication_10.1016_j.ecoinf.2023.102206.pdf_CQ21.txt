Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on explaining the concept of Transfer Learning (TL), Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL), and its application in predicting GDP using CO2 emission data.

However, it does mention the execution time analysis of the approaches and the improvement of IFTL over other models like GRNN and SVR. But it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
