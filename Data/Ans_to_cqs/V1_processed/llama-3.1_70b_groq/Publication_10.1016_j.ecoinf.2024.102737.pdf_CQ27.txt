Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the performance of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks, specifically in the recognition of marine animals. It also touches on the challenges of pose handling and the advantages of preprocessing input data over relying on data augmentation.

However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
