Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions the training details, including the use of the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3, mini-batches of 16 elements, and the Pytorch 1.3 framework. However, it does not specify the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
