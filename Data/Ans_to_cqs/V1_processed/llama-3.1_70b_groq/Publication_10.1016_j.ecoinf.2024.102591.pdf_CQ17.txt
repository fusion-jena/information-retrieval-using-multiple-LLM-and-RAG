I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on the use of Random Forest (RF) regression algorithms in the context of remote sensing and fire mapping, specifically in the FIREMAP system. The text mentions the use of RF regression for retrieving FCOVER (Fractional Cover) from post-fire Sentinel-2 scenes, but it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or regularization methods.
