Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of contributors to a research project, along with their roles and responsibilities, such as writing, reviewing, editing, supervision, investigation, and data curation. However, it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
