Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the application of deep learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and autoencoders, to estimate variables in aquatic environments and assess aquatic ecosystem health. It also mentions the use of various machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and random forests (RFs), but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
