The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the methodology used to develop the predictive models, including data gathering, preprocessing, and machine learning model deployment. However, it does mention "Model deployment" as a stage in the proposed generic framework, but it does not provide further details on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
