The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors used backward stepwise selection to try to identify an effective model with fewer variables, which suggests that they were evaluating the model's performance at each step and selecting the variables that contributed most to the model's accuracy.

Additionally, the text mentions that the authors compared the performance of the simple sex discrimination model to the more complex full model, noting that the simple model produced comparable classification accuracy with some slight increase in misclassification for the training and validation sets, but a modest improvement in the test set. This suggests that the authors were evaluating the model's performance on multiple datasets (training, validation, and test sets) to assess its generalizability and robustness.

However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model's performance during training (e.g., cross-validation, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) are not mentioned in the provided context.
