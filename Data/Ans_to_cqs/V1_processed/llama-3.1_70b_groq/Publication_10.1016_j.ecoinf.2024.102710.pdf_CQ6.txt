Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the evaluation of different embedding models, such as VGG16, ResNet152-V2, VGGish, YAMNet, and BirdNet, and their performance on various datasets. It discusses the use of transfer learning, active learning, and the investigation of different embedding layers, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this context.
