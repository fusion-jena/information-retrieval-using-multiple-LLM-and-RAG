Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on ensemble modeling, machine learning, and forest fire prediction studies, with no mention of deep learning or the datasets typically used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
