Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) as a machine learning technique for image classification, but it does not delve into deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
