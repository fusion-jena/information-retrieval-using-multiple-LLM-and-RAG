Based on the provided context, it appears that time-lapse cameras are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for Arctic wildlife monitoring. The text mentions "time-lapse camera" as a keyword and references a study that uses camera traps as a sampling tool. Additionally, the text cites a paper titled "Snap happy: camera traps are an effective sampling tool when compared with alternative methods," which suggests that camera traps are a viable method for collecting data.

It is also possible that other methods, such as surveys or sensors, may be used in conjunction with camera traps or as alternative methods for collecting data. However, based on the provided context, camera traps appear to be a primary method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for Arctic wildlife monitoring.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information on the use of public datasets as a method for collecting raw data. Therefore, it is unclear whether public datasets are utilized in the deep learning pipeline for this specific application.
