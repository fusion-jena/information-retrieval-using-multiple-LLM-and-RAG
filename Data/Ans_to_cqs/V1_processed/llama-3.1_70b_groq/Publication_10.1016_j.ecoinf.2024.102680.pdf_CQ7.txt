Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text primarily discusses the limitations of the original YOLOv8 network in capturing accurate feature information for underwater optical images and proposes modifications to the network architecture to improve its performance. It also mentions the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computational complexity, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, it is mentioned that the batch size of all networks is set to 16 uniformly, but this is not directly related to the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
