I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be a list of academic papers and publications related to ecology, biodiversity, and conservation, with topics such as species distributions, fishbase data, and climate change impacts on marine fisheries. There is no mention of deep learning models or their applications. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
