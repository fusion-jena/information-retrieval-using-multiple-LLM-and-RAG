Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any information about a deep learning model or the measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to Bayesian networks, ecological informatics, and permafrost research, but it does not mention deep learning or any specific measures taken to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a meaningful answer to this query.
