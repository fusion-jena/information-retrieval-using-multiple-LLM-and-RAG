I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a text discussing the application of deep learning techniques in ecology, but it does not include any information about a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
