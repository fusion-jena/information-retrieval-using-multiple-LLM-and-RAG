The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Hyperband algorithm, which is a combination of an initial random search and a "successive halving" strategy. This algorithm is used to efficiently search the hyperparameter space, particularly when computational resources are limited. The Hyperband algorithm works by initially sampling a set of hyperparameters for model architectures, then partially training the models to quickly eliminate underperforming configurations. The remaining configurations are then grouped into sets of different sizes and trained further, with the best-performing configurations being promoted to the next stage and the under-performing ones being eliminated. This process is repeated until only one configuration remains, which is considered the best configuration found.
