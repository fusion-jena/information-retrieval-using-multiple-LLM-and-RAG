Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and snippets of text related to deep learning and species distribution modeling, but it does not include any information about a specific code repository.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
