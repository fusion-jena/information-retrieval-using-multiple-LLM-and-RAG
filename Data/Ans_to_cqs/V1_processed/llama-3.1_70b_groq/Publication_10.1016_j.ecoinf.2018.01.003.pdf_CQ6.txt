Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets related to neural networks, deep learning, and various applications, but it does not provide a clear answer to the question.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. Typically, preprocessing steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model stability and convergence
* Feature engineering: selecting relevant features, transforming features, and creating new features to improve model performance
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data

Please note that the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture. If you're looking for more detailed information, I recommend consulting a reliable source on deep learning or the documentation of the specific deep learning framework you're using.
