Based on the provided context, it appears that the researchers used stratified random sampling to address data bias during preprocessing. Specifically, they used QGIS' ACATAMa plug-in to generate stratified random sampling points, and increased the number of points per class by 5-fold (to 1500) to account for bias associated with restricted inclusion probabilities. This suggests that they used a form of oversampling to ensure that each class had a sufficient number of points for accurate representation.

There is no mention of undersampling or diverse data collection techniques being used to address data bias. Additionally, the context does not specifically mention the use of deep learning pipelines, but rather focuses on the preprocessing and validation of habitat classification data.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that stratified random sampling and oversampling were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
