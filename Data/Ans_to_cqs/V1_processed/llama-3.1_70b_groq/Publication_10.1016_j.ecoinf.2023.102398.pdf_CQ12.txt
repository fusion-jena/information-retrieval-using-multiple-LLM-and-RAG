The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mention of "YOLOv5" and "SENet attention mechanism" in the text, it can be inferred that the model is likely a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The use of an attention mechanism, specifically SENet, also suggests that the model incorporates elements of CNNs. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
