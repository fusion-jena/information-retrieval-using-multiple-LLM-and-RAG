The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that the input layer of the UODN (Underwater Object Detection Network) performs preprocessing operations, including "mosaic data augmentation". 

Mosaic data augmentation is a technique that combines multiple images into a single image, which can help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's robustness. However, the context does not provide information on other data augmentation techniques that may be applied in the pipeline.
