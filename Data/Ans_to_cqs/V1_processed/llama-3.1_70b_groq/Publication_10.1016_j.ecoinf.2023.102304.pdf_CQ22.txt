The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, user's accuracy, and producer's accuracy. The kappa coefficient is specifically used to comprehensively evaluate the detection accuracy for different indices and parameter sets. The overall accuracy is also used, but it is noted that it is not well-suited for evaluating the performance of various indices for LTR, which uses a binary classification system of 'burned' and 'unburned' values. Additionally, the model's predictive accuracy is also evaluated using feature importance metrics, such as the reduction in Gini impurity for Random Forest and the gain for XGBoost.
