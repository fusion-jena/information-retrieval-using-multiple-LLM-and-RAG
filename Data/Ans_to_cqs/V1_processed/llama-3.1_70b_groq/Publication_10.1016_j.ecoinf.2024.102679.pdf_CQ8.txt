I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context appears to be a research article or paper discussing the use of deep learning for wildlife population estimation and aerial surveys, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
