I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses various machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and heterogeneous ensemble techniques, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
