The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information on the datasets used and their respective splits. 

For example, the dataset contains 638 images, divided into seven categories, with 510 images for training and 128 for testing. Similarly, the trash-ICRA19 dataset includes 1144 images across three categories, with 915 images for training and 229 for testing. 

It can be inferred that the data is split based on the number of images available, with a larger proportion of images used for training and a smaller proportion used for testing. However, the exact criteria or ratio used for splitting the data is not specified. 

In general, common practices for splitting data include using a random split, stratified split, or k-fold cross-validation. The choice of splitting criteria depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model being used.
