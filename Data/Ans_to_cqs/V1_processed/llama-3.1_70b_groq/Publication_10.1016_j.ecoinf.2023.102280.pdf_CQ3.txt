Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustics applications. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of applying deep noise reduction techniques to bioacoustics, the limitations of existing methods, and the potential of transformer attention mechanisms. It also discusses the differences between natural language processing (NLP) and bioacoustics applications, but it does not delve into data annotation techniques.

However, it is mentioned that collecting clean recordings is infeasible in many cases, and noise profiles are often superimposed on clean data to provide both input data and a "denoised" ground truth. This suggests that data annotation might involve labeling or annotating the clean and noisy data, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustics applications, as this information is not provided in the context.
