Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text describes the use of a stepwise variable selection procedure with a p-value threshold of 0.05 to select the variables with the best discriminating power, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
