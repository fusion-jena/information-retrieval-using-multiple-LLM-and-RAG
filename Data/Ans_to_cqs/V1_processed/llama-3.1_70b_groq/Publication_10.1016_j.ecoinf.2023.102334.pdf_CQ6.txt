Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention "feature normalization process" in the context of the model's performance on images with varying quality. 

It is mentioned that the feature normalization process is not suitable for their model, as it gives more attention to features with poor image quality. This suggests that feature normalization might be a preprocessing step that is typically considered, but it is not used in this specific case.

No other preprocessing steps, such as scaling or cleaning, are mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the given information.
