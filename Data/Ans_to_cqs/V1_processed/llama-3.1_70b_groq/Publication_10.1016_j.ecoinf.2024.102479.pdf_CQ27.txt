Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses various machine learning algorithms, their hyperparameters, and the use of Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) for hyperparameter tuning. It also mentions some research papers and packages related to machine learning, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
