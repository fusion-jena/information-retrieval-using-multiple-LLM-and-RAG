Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on word embedding techniques, such as Word2vec and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and their applications in natural language processing and semantic analysis. It also mentions pre-trained models, such as BERT, but does not delve into the optimization techniques used in their training. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
