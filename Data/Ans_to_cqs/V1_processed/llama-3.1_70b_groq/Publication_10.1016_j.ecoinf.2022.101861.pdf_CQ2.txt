The text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the pipeline is designed to analyze audio recordings of bird sounds. The text mentions the use of spectrograms, which are visual representations of audio signals, and the software Kaleidoscope Pro, which is used for acoustic data analysis. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely uses audio data formats, possibly in the form of WAV or MP3 files, and possibly CSV files for metadata or annotations. However, the exact data formats used are not specified in the text.
