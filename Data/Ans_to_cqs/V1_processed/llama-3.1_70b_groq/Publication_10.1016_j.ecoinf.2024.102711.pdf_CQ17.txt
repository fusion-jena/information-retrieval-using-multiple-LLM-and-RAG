Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that overfitting is an issue in ML modeling, particularly when the learning dataset used is relatively small.

It mentions that some recent studies have evaluated model performance against the data used in model fitting and tuning, which may fail to identify the true fit and behavior of ML models. Additionally, it mentions that analysis of model behavior showed flawed behavior in some models, such as non-monotonic trends that result from overfitting.

While it does not provide specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, it does mention that techniques such as k-fold cross-validation are used for hyperparameter tuning, which can help prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
