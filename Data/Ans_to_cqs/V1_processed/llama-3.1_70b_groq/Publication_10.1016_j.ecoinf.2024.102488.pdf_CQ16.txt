Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of fusion quality, feature selection, and classification models. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used.

However, it does mention the use of cross-validation in the RFECV process to select the optimal features. Specifically, it states that the process of feature pruning is repeated recursively until the cross-validation accuracy reaches the highest level. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set is being monitored, but it does not provide specific details on when training is considered complete.

Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, as this information is not provided in the given context.
