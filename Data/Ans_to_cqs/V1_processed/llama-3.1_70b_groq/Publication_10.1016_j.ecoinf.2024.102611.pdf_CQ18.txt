The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using validation and test sets, as mentioned in Section 4.4. The context states that "both validation and test sets are considered separately to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, leading to generalizability and scalability towards unseen datasets." This suggests that the model's performance is monitored and evaluated using these sets, but the specific strategy or metrics used for evaluation are not mentioned.
