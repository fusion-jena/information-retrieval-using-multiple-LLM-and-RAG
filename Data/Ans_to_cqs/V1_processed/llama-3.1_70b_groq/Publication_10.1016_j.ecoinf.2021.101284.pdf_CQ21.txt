Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on data preprocessing, specifically standardization, and model development, with figures showing W* parameters values in different MLR models. There is no information about what happens after the models are trained. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
