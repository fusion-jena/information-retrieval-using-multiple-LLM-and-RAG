Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on data-driven models, hyperparameter tuning, and automated machine learning (AutoML) in the context of modeling fire behavior, with a mention of a limited dataset comprising 113 data records. There is no mention of popular deep learning datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
