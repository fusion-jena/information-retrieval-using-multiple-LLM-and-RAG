I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the potential use of machine learning or deep neural networks to increase the accuracy of prediction, but it does not specify the type of model. The context appears to be focused on the use of remote sensing data and topographic indices to estimate soil moisture, and the development of a predictive model for volumetric water content (VWC). However, it does not provide information on the specific deep learning model used.
