Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the dataset splitting, deep learning model training, and evaluation procedures.

However, it does mention that the model predicts the class label for each patch using the weighted majority voting technique, but it does not provide further details on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this query.
