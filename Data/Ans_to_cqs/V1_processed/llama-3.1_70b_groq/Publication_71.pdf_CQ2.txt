The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image data, specifically RGB and NIR (Near-Infrared) images. The context mentions the use of DeepLabV3+ architecture, which is a semantic segmentation model, and the discussion about accommodating four-channel input images (RGB + NIR) suggests that the pipeline is working with image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
