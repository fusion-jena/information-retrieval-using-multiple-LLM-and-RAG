Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It does mention a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ducha-aiki/caffenet-benchmark) that was accessed on 24 March 2020, but this appears to be related to the evaluation of CNN design choices performance on ImageNet-2012, rather than the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query. Therefore, I do not know the location of the data repository.
