The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention some accuracy assessment methods used during the model building phase.

According to the context, the accuracy assessment methods used include:

1. 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions, which helps to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy (OA) and reflects the resulting distribution of models with minimums, maximums, quartiles, and medians.
2. Splitting the reference dataset into training and testing sets at a 70:30 ratio, where the testing dataset is used to predict the accuracy of the models.

Additionally, the context mentions that post-classification steps, such as segmentation and filtering, can provide better maps with a lower rate of salt-and-pepper errors. However, it does not provide further details on the specific postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
