Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) and mentions various machine learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). However, it does not provide information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context does provide information on the features used in the LSM model, such as soil type, distance to stream, land cover, lithology, and distance to road. It also provides statistics on the area count, landslide percentage, and frequency ratio (FR) for different classes. However, it does not mention any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
