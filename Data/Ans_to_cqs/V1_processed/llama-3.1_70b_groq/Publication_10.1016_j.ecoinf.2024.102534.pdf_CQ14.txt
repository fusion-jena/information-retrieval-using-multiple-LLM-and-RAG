Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the performance of the ensemble models, the evaluation metrics used (AUC and TSS), and the results of the predictions, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
