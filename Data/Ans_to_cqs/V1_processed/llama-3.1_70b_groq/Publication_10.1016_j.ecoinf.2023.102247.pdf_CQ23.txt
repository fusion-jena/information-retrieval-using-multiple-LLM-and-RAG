To ensure the generalizability of the models, the researchers employed cross-validation by using 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the other 30% as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting. However, it is not mentioned whether the dataset was diverse or if stratified splitting was used. The researchers also used an ensemble modeling approach, which combines the predictions of multiple models, including regression-based and machine-learning models, to generate a final ensembled model for each species. This approach can help to improve the generalizability of the model by reducing the impact of individual model biases.
