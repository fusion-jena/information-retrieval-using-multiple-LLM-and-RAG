I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It mentions that the researchers used the well-developed deep learning algorithm Mask-RCNN, but it does not provide a link to the specific implementation or repository used in the study. The context also mentions that there are efforts to promote deep learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository.
