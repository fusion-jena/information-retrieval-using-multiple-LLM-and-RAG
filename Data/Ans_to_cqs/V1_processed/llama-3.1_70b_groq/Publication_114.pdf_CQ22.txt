The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context include:

1. Overall Accuracy (OA): This is the overall percentage of correctly classified samples.
2. Kappa: This is a statistical measure that takes into account the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications.
3. User's Accuracy (UA): This is the percentage of correctly classified samples for a specific class.
4. Producer's Accuracy (PA): This is the percentage of correctly classified samples for a specific class, from the perspective of the producer or the model.
5. F1-Score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced measure of both.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the three deep learning algorithms, VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet, in classifying tree species. The results show that VGG16 achieved the highest overall accuracy of 73.25%, followed by ResNet50 with an accuracy of 72.93%, and AlexNet with an accuracy of 68.53%.
