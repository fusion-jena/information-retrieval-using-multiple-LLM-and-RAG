The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model was trained for up to 30 epochs, and the optimal number of epochs was determined using a validation data set (data partition Bv). This suggests that the training process may have been stopped based on the performance on the validation set, but the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.
