Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on various research papers and techniques related to fish classification, underwater image processing, and deep learning.

However, I can provide some general information on common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. Common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping (horizontal and vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (resizing the image)
* Color jittering (changing brightness, contrast, saturation)
* Cropping (randomly selecting a portion of the image)
* Translation (shifting the image horizontally or vertically)

These techniques help increase the diversity of the training data, making the model more robust and less prone to overfitting.
