To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset. The dataset used for training was obtained from Google Image Search, which provides a wide range of images from different sources. This diversity in the dataset helps the model to learn features that are generalizable across different images.

Secondly, the model was trained on a subset of labels with more than 12 images in the training dataset. This ensures that the model is trained on a sufficient number of images for each label, which helps to improve its generalizability.

Thirdly, the model was evaluated on three different test datasets: Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist. This helps to evaluate the model's performance on different datasets and ensures that it is generalizable across different datasets.

Lastly, the model was trained with standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring. This helps to increase the diversity of the training dataset and ensures that the model is robust to different transformations.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used to evaluate the model. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
