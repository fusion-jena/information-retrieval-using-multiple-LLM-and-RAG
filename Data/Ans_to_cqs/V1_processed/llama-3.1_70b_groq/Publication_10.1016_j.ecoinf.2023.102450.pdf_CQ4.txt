Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning techniques for animal detection and tracking in wildlife videos. It includes references to various papers and techniques, but does not specifically mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

However, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's robustness. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping (horizontal and/or vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (resizing the image)
* Color jittering (changing the brightness, contrast, and saturation)
* Cropping (randomly cropping a portion of the image)

But without explicit mention in the context, I cannot confirm which specific data augmentation techniques were applied in this particular pipeline.
