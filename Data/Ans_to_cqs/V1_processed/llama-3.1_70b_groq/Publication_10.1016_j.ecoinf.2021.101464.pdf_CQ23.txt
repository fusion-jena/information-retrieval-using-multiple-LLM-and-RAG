To ensure the generalizability of the Random Forest (RF) model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, which is a technique used to assess the model's performance on unseen data. The results of the cross-validation are shown in Table 5, which indicates that the model has high prediction accuracy and good stability, with an average R2 of 0.931 and an average RMSE of 141.124 ion/cm3.

Secondly, the model was trained and tested on a dataset that was not further described in the provided context, but it is mentioned that the observation index can be increased, the observation time can be extended, and the joint observation of multi-region and multi-tree species can be strengthened in future research. This suggests that the dataset may not be diverse, but there are plans to improve it in the future.

Lastly, there is no mention of stratified splitting being used to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, the use of 10-fold cross-validation suggests that the model was evaluated on a variety of subsets of the data, which can help to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a specific subset of the data.

Overall, while the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the RF model are not fully described, the use of 10-fold cross-validation suggests that the model was evaluated on a variety of subsets of the data, which can help to ensure that the model is generalizable.
