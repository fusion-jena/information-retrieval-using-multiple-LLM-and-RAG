The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on the information given, we can infer some of the steps that might have been involved.

The context mentions the calculation of various metrics such as F1-Score, Accuracy, Kappa, and F1_Ave for the ensemble CNN, Random Forest, and overall models. This suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved.

Additionally, the context provides an error matrix for the ensemble CNN, which is essentially a confusion matrix. This implies that the creation of a confusion matrix is another postprocessing step involved.

There is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in a model's predictions. It is unclear whether saliency maps were used in this study.

Other postprocessing steps such as model interpretation, feature importance analysis, or uncertainty estimation are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether these steps were involved in the study.
