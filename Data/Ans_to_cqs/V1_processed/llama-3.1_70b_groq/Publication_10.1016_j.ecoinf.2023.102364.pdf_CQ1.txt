The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the pipeline appear to be primarily based on field surveys and publicly available datasets. Specifically, the text mentions "multi-year field work" and "50 survey location data" for Short-billed Gulls (Larus canus) during May and June 2014 and 2015, which suggests that field surveys were conducted to collect data on the presence and absence of the species.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of "Open access data" and "Big data" which implies that publicly available datasets were also utilized. The text specifically mentions the use of US Census 2000 data, which is a publicly available dataset.

There is no mention of sensors being used to collect raw data. The text does mention the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) data, which may involve the use of satellite or aerial imagery, but it is not clear if this is used to collect raw data or if it is used for processing and analysis.

Overall, it appears that the primary methods of collecting raw data in this pipeline are field surveys and publicly available datasets.
