Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context only discusses the training process, including data normalization, batch size, optimizer, learning ratio, and loss function, but does not address randomness or reproducibility. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
