Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses various modifications made to the YOLOv5 model, such as replacing the Focus layer with a novel Stem Block, integrating depth-wise separable convolutions, and modifying the loss function from traditional CIoU to Focal-EIoU. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

The text does mention that the model's computational complexity is quantified in FLOPs, and the number of parameters is calculated using Equation (14). Additionally, it discusses the model's speed in terms of FPS, which encompasses preprocessing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds. However, it does not provide details on how the hyperparameters are tuned to achieve these results.

Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, as this information is not provided in the text.
