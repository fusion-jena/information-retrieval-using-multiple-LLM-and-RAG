To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors conducted comprehensive experiments comparing their model with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on multiple datasets, including UCCS, C-60, and U45. This suggests that they used a diverse dataset to evaluate their model's performance.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. The authors do mention that they maintained consistency by utilizing source codes provided by authors or referring to original paper descriptions, and that all methods underwent identical testing and training processes throughout the experiments. This suggests that they took steps to ensure fairness and comparability in their evaluation, but the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not fully described.

It is also worth noting that the authors mention that their model is designed to generate images of a fixed size (256Ã—256), which may pose a limitation in scenarios requiring larger or more detailed images. This suggests that the model's generalizability may be limited to certain applications or image sizes.
