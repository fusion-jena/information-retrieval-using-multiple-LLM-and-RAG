Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, climate change, and conservation biology, but it does not provide information on data collection methods for deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
