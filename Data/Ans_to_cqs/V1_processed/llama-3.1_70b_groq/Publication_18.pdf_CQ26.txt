The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention two techniques used to overcome limitations in practice when working with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Transfer learning and data-augmentation.

Data-augmentation is mentioned as a technique that applies specific transformations to the training images to simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real-world scenarios, such as scaling, rotations, translations, and different illumination conditions. This technique can help increase the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs.

While data-augmentation can help with data diversity, it is not explicitly mentioned as a technique to address data bias. The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling, are not discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique that can be inferred as related to addressing data bias is data-augmentation, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique for addressing data bias. The other techniques mentioned in the query are not discussed in the provided context.
