I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of references and a table of variable classifications, primarily related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and bioclimate. There is no mention of data annotation techniques or deep learning pipelines. The context does not provide any information about bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
