Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It does mention the use of a "cloud platform" in the work by Bar et al. (2019), but it does not provide further details on the specific platform used. Additionally, it mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a platform for analyzing large amounts of satellite data, but it does not indicate that GEE was used to deploy a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
