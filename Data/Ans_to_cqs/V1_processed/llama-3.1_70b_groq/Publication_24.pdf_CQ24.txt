Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The text primarily discusses the application of deep learning tools for urban ecoacoustic assessment, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the benefits of ecoacoustic surveying. It does mention that a dataset was randomly selected from the remaining sites, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
