Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation and results of the machine learning models, feature analysis, and handling of missing values. It does mention the use of cross-validation to assess model reliability and avoid over-fitting, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
