I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs), and gradient boosting for modeling and prediction tasks. It also mentions the tuning of hyperparameters, such as learning rate, momentum, and training iterations, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
