Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily focuses on the Transformer model, its self-attention mechanism, and positional encoding scheme, which are used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It does not discuss data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
