The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the training process took around 10 hours on the CPU and the accuracy obtained reaches 95% on 140 epochs. This suggests that the training process may have been stopped after a fixed number of epochs, but the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete is not specified.
