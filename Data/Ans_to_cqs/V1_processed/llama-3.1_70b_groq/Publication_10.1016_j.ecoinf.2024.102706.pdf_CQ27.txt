Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training and evaluation of various machine learning models, including linear regression, Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, for predicting canopy cover from planet data. It provides details on the hyperparameter tuning, model performance, and evaluation metrics, but does not cover the deployment process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
