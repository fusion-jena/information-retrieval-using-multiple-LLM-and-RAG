I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily discusses the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model, its application in aquatic environments, and its comparison with other atmospheric correction algorithms. It also mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep convolutional neural networks, but does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in these models.
