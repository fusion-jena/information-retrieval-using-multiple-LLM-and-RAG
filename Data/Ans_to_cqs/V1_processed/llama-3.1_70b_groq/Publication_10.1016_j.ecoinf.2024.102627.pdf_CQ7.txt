The context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that the model is validated and calibrated on a validation set, and then re-trained on the entire dataset. This suggests that the data is split into at least two parts: a training set and a validation set. The context also mentions that the model is trained on a large dataset of 999,258 occurrences from 14,129 species, but it does not provide information on how this data is split for training and testing. Therefore, the exact criteria used for data splitting are not specified in the provided context.
