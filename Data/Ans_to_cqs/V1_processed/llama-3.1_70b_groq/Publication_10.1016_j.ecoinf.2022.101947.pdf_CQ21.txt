Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data collection, trail formation, and model training using the FIT pairwise comparison model. It mentions the generation of a classification dendrogram and the achievement of 100% accuracy in predicting the classification of 44 captive Amur tigers. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that may have been performed after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training in this study.
