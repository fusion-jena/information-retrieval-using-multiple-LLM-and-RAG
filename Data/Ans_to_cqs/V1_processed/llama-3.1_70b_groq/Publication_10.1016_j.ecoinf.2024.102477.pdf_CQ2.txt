The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely to be time-series data, possibly in a CSV format.

The context mentions the use of SLSTM (Seasonal Long Short-Term Memory) models for forecasting seasonal time-series data, which suggests that the data is in a time-series format. Additionally, the context mentions the use of ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models, which are also commonly used for time-series forecasting.

While the context does not explicitly mention CSV as the data format, it is a common format used for storing and processing time-series data. However, without further information, it is impossible to confirm the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline.
