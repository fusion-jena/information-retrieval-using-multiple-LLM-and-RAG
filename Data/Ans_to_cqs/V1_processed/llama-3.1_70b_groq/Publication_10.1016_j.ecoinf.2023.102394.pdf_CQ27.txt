Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and acknowledgments from a research study, and it does not include details on model deployment.

However, it does mention the use of TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework, and Keras, a high-level neural networks API, which suggests that the model was likely trained using one of these frameworks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of R, a programming language for statistical computing, which may have been used for data analysis or model evaluation.

But without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
