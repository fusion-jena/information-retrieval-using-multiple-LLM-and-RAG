Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of feature extraction parameters and the performance evaluation of different convolutional neural network (CNN) models. It discusses the comparison of standard deviation values for each performance metric, the determination of the optimal configuration, and the evaluation of each model's performance. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
