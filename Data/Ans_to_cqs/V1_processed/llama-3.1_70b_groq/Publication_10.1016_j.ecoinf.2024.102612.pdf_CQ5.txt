The provided context does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the deep learning model was trained with synthetic data and tested on real MS point clouds collected in Section 2.3, which is referred to as the ground truth data. Additionally, it mentions the use of Sentinel-2 MS imagery in another study. Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline appear to be custom datasets, specifically LiDAR point clouds and MS imagery, rather than standard benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
