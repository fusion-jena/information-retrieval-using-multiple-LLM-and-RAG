GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are the primary hardware resources used for training deep learning models, as mentioned in the context. The text states that "the most common use (139 of 143 articles, i.e., 97%) was in machine learning where the training phase can readily be parallelised and accessible software tools are available to utilise GPUs for this purpose." This indicates that GPUs are widely used for training deep learning models due to their ability to parallelize computations and the availability of software tools that can leverage this capability. There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) in the provided context.
