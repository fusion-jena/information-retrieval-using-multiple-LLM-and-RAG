The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework, to optimize the structure and hyperparameters of the machine learning models.

In the context of the provided information, randomness is handled through the use of techniques such as bagging and feature fraction. Bagging is a technique used in the LightGBM model, where a subset of features is randomly selected on each iteration (tree). The bagging_fraction parameter controls the proportion of data that is randomly selected for each iteration. The bagging_freq parameter controls the frequency at which bagging is performed.

Additionally, the feature_fraction parameter is used to randomly select a subset of features on each iteration. This helps to reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, the use of Optuna and the aforementioned techniques suggest that the authors are aware of the importance of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, without further information, it is unclear whether a random seed value is set to ensure reproducibility of the results.
