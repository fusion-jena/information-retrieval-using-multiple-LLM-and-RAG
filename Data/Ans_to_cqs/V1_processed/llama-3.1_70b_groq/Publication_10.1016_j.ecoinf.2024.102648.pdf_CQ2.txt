Based on the provided context, it appears that image analysis is used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions "image analysis with machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and model combination (MC) techniques to identify, monitor and estimate plant disease severity under field conditions." This suggests that image data is used as input for the deep learning models. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and deep convolutional encoder network, which are types of neural networks that can be used for image classification tasks. 

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are used to store and process data related to the plant disease severity, as the text mentions the use of machine learning and statistical models, which often rely on tabular data. 

Overall, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline appears to be image data, with possible use of CSV files for storing and processing related data.
