Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a study on soil nutrient concentration analysis using various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
