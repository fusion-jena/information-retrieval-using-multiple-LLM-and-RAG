The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does discuss the training process and the loss function used to train the CNN-based model.

The context mentions that the training objective is to iteratively minimize the average loss defined in equation (1), which measures the difference between the output of the final layer and the ground truth. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is used to update the weights, as shown in equation (2).

While the context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it can be inferred that the training process is likely to continue until the loss function converges or reaches a certain threshold. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer.

In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include:

* Validation loss plateau: The training process is stopped when the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau.
* Maximum number of epochs: The training process is stopped after a fixed number of epochs.
* Minimum loss threshold: The training process is stopped when the loss function reaches a certain threshold.

However, these criteria are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
