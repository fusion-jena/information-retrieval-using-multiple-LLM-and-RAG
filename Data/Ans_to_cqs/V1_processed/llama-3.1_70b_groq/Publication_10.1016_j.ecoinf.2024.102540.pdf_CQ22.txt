The study evaluated four metrics to assess the performance of the deep learning models, specifically the YOLOv5 family of detection models. These metrics are:

1. Precision: the percentage of correct positive predictions.
2. Mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5): measures the accuracy of object detection models using an Intersection-over-union measure set to 0.5.
3. Recall: shows how successfully a model can make correct detection predictions out of all of the predictions it should make.
4. Mean Percent Error of Misdetection: measures the error rate of the model in detecting objects.

These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of detector models, as mentioned in the study.
