Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the challenges and limitations of applying deep learning-based denoising methods to bioacoustics applications, the architecture of these models, and the difficulties in generating training data. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
