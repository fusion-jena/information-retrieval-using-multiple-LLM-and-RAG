Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the optimization of model parameters, such as learning rate, momentum, and input size, but does not delve into the preprocessing steps.

However, it can be inferred that the input size is a parameter that is optimized during the training process, which suggests that some form of resizing or scaling might be involved. The input size is optimized to be (200, 250, 3), which could indicate that the images are resized to this dimension before being fed into the model.

Other than this, there is no mention of normalization, cleaning, or other preprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given information.
