GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and 'tensor processing units' are mentioned as examples of faster hardware that ecologists may need to use to overcome the computational expensiveness of deep learning. Additionally, large-resourced cloud computing services are also mentioned as a potential solution. There is no mention of specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the provided context, but rather a general suggestion of the types of hardware that may be needed to address the computational demands of deep learning.
