Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the architecture of the proposed CNN-LSTM model, its performance, and the experimental setup. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the model is trained on images of plant species. Typically, image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation are common practices in deep learning-based image classification tasks. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this query.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model are not mentioned.
