The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context is not explicitly stated in terms of traditional train, test, and validation sets. However, it is mentioned that the default validation percentage in TensorFlow was adjusted from 10% to 16% due to the limited number of images available for some species. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact proportions are not specified for the training set.

Additionally, the text mentions that a leave-one-out cross-validation approach was used for evaluation. This means that in each round, one image was left out from the n species in a country to evaluate the model, while the remaining images were used for training. This approach is used as a trade-off between maximizing the number of samples for training the classifier and optimizing computing time.
