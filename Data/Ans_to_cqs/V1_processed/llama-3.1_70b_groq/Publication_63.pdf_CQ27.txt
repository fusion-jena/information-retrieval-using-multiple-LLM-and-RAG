The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, hyperparameters, and model evaluation, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

However, it does mention that the trained model was applied to the test dataset, which suggests that the model was used for inference after training. But the specific steps or methods used for model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection, are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
