The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is out-of-bag validation. This approach involves evaluating the accuracy of the model at simulated locations using predictions made during the bagging process. Specifically, out-of-bag predictions for each simulated data point are obtained by predicting the values at the data points that were not selected for each bootstrap sample, and averaging the results of these predicted values across all bootstrap samples. This method allows for unbiased estimates of model performance without omitting portions of the feature space during validation.
