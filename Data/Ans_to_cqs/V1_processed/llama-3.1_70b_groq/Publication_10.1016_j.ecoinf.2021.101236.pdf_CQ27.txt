Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the development and training of the BirdNET algorithm, including the methods used for data acquisition, preprocessing, and model architecture. It also discusses the training workflow and the application of the model to continuous soundscape recordings.

However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related details. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
