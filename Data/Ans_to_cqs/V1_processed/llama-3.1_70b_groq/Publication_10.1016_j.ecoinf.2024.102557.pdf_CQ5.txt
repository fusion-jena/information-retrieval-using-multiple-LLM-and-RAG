Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on ecological and environmental research, with references to papers on topics like species distribution models, biodiversity estimation, and machine learning applications in ecology.

However, one paper mentioned in the context, "Applications for deep learning in ecology" by Christin et al. (2019), might be relevant to the query. But without accessing the full paper, it's unclear whether it discusses specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I couldn't find any information on specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline in the provided context.
