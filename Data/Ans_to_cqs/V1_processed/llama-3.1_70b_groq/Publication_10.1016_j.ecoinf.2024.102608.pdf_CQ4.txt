Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and machine learning algorithms for estimating water quality parameters using satellite data, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
