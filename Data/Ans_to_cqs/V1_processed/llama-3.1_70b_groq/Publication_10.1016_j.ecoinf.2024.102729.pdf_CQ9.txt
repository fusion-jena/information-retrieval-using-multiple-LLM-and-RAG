Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research articles related to environmental science, hydrology, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. If you have any more information or context about the specific project or research, I may be able to help you better.
