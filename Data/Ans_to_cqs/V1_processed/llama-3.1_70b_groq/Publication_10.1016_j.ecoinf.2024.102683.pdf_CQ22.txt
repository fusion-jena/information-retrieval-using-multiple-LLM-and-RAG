The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated based on the true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) of the model's predictions. The specific equations used to calculate these metrics are:

* Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
* Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
* Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
* Specificity is also mentioned, but the equation is not provided in the given context.
* F1-score is also mentioned, but the equation is not provided in the given context.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, including its ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances, as well as its ability to avoid false positives and false negatives.
