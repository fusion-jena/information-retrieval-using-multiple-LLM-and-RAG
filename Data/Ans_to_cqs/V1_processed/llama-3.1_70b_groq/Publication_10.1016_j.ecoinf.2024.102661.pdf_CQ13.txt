The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. However, it does mention that the TPEBO algorithm is used for hyperparameter optimization, and that the number of hidden layers is a crucial hyperparameter that is explored within a range of 1 to 3.

Additionally, the context mentions that the TPEBO-LSTM algorithm is used for hyperparameter optimization, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of hyperparameters used in the model. The pseudo-code of the TPEBO-LSTM algorithm is mentioned, but it is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a complete list of hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. If more context or information is provided, I may be able to give a more detailed answer.
