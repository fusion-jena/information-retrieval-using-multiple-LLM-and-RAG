Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN), for tasks like generating synthetic data and modeling coral cover. It also mentions the use of a Variational Autoencoder model for the initial coral cover data and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model for generating synthetic connectivity data.

However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this context.
