Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the use of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis in the context of ecosystem services (ES) and biodiversity. It does not discuss deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
