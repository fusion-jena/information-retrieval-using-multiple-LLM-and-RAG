The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, but it does mention that the authors "trained several models on the insect TL (TLm) benchmark dataset to optimise the hyper-parameter α" and that they "chose α = 0.5 in our study" after observing marginal changes in accuracy. This suggests that the authors may have used a manual or trial-and-error approach to optimize the hyperparameter α, but the exact method is not specified. There is no mention of grid search or random search.
