Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of a Siamese network and few-shot learning, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
