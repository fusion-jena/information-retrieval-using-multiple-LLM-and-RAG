I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized. It discusses the performance of different models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, DenseNet-201) on a dataset, including their accuracy on raw and pre-processed images, and provides some analysis of the features learned by the models. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as the use of grid search or random search.
