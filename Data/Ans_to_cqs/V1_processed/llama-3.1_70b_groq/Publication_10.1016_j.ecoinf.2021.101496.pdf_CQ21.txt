Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model development and training process, including the comparison of different modeling approaches (LM, GLM, and ANN) for predicting SPAD values.

However, it does mention that the performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute difference (MAD), R-squared, and mean deviance. Additionally, the context mentions that the residuals obtained from the ANN model were analyzed for a more reliable evaluation of the model performance.

But, it does not provide information on the calculation of confusion matrices or the generation of saliency maps, which are typically used for model interpretability and explainability. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
