Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on machine learning models for predicting water quality, specifically discussing hyperparameter tuning for models such as LGBM and GB. It mentions techniques like subsampling to reduce overfitting, but does not explicitly address data bias or preprocessing techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

However, it does mention that researchers have employed ensemble models to address overfitting, which can be a related issue to data bias. Additionally, it mentions data pre-processing based on an ensemble bagging technique combined with the SVM model, but does not provide further details on how data bias is addressed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
