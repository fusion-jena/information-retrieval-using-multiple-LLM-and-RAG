The text does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the operating system used is MAC OS and the processor is Apple M1-Chip. This suggests that the training was likely done on a Mac computer with an Apple M1 chip, which is a type of system-on-a-chip (SoC) that integrates the CPU, GPU, and other components into a single chip. Therefore, it is likely that the training was done on the integrated GPU of the Apple M1 chip, but this is not explicitly stated in the text.
