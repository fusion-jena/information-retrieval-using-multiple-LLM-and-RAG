The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some of the steps that might be involved.

The context mentions the calculation of metrics such as mAP@0.5:0.95, FPS, and validation losses. This suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of techniques such as PANet, BiFPN, CIOU, Focal-CIOU, and Focal-EIOU, which are likely used for tasks such as object detection and bounding box regression. This might involve the calculation of metrics such as precision, recall, and IoU (Intersection over Union).

The context also mentions the use of heat maps, label maps, and mask maps, which are often used for visualization and analysis of the model's performance. This might be related to the calculation of saliency maps, which are used to visualize the importance of different input features for the model's predictions.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the calculation of confusion matrices, which are often used to evaluate the performance of classification models.

In summary, based on the provided context, we can infer that the postprocessing steps involved after model training might include metrics calculation (e.g., mAP, FPS, validation losses) and visualization (e.g., heat maps, label maps, mask maps). However, we cannot confirm the calculation of confusion matrices or saliency maps without more information.
