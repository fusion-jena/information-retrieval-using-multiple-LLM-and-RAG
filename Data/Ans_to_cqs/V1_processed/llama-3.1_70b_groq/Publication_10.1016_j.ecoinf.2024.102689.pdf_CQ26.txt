Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on various deep learning methods and architectures for fish recognition, classification, and monitoring, as well as model compression and optimization techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of samples from the minority class to balance the data.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the data.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources or environments to reduce bias.

But, I don't know if these techniques are specifically used in the context of the provided papers.
