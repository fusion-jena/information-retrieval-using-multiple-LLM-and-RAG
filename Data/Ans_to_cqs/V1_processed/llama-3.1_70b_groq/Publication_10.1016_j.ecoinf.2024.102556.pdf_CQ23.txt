To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the YOLOv7 detection model, the dataset was divided into five subsets using k-fold cross-validation. Each subset served as a validation set, whereas the remaining four subsets constituted the training set. The model underwent five rounds of training and validation to assess its generalizability. This approach allowed the model to optimally use all the samples in the dataset, ensuring that each sample was trained and validated in a different subset. This method helped to mitigate concerns about overfitting, inability to assess the model's generalization ability, and uneven data distribution affecting prediction rates.
