The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was fine-tuned with Gulf of Mexico data, which suggests that the model was adapted to a specific environment or dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained with different batch sizes (50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 frames) and evaluated on a test set, as shown in Table 3. This suggests that some form of evaluation was performed to assess the model's performance, but it does not provide information on whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of dropout and DropConnect during fine-tuning, which are regularization techniques that can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalizability. However, this is not a direct measure to ensure generalizability.

Overall, while the context provides some information on the model's training and evaluation, it does not provide a clear answer to the question of what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
