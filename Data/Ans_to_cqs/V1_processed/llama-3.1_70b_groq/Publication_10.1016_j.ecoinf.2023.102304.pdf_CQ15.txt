I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be discussing the optimization of parameters for a Land Treatment and Restoration (LTR) algorithm, specifically for detecting burned areas using satellite imagery. It mentions the optimization of parameters, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used.
