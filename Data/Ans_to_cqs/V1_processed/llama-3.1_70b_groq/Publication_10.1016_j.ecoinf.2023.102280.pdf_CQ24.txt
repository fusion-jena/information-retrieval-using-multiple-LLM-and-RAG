Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the challenges and limitations of applying deep learning-based denoising methods to bioacoustics applications, particularly in generating training data and handling sparse vocalizations.

However, it does mention that noise is "randomly sampled" from a dataset containing 963 five-second noise samples to generate the noisy input for training. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data augmentation process, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
