Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning for bioacoustic classification, particularly for marine mammals, and mentions various studies and research papers on the topic. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of a trained deep learning model.

Some of the papers mentioned in the context discuss the use of deep learning models for classification tasks, but they do not provide details on the deployment process. For example, the paper by Stowell (2022) discusses the use of deep learning for bioacoustic classification, but it does not mention the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
