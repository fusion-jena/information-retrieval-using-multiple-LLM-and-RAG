The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are as follows:

For object detection tasks (Mask R-CNN and FGFA), the following techniques are used simultaneously:
1. Horizontal flip
2. Add/subtract intensity
3. Gaussian blur
4. Additive Gaussian noise

Additionally, a special augmentation function called "Fog" is used with a probability of 10%, combined only with random horizontal flip. This simulates fog in the video.

For action recognition tasks, the following techniques are used simultaneously:
1. Temporal jittering (randomly choosing the starting point of the 16 frames in the input video)
2. Spatial crops
3. Horizontal flips

These data augmentation techniques are used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
