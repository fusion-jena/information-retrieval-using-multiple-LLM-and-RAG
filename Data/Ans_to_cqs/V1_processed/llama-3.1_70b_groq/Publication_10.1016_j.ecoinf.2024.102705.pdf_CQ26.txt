The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a study by Delisle et al. (2023) that focuses on reducing bias in density estimates for unmarked populations that exhibit reactive behavior towards camera traps. The study suggests that the authors are aware of the issue of bias in data collection, but it does not provide specific techniques used to address this bias.

One of the references mentioned, Christopher and Hugh (2024), is a book on deep learning foundations and concepts. While it may cover techniques for addressing data bias, the provided context does not specifically mention this.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can suggest that techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used in machine learning to address data bias, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
