Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental research, with mentions of data sources, research papers, and formulas, but it does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or data formats.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data formats used might be related to spatial data, such as satellite imagery or geospatial data, given the mentions of land use, carbon storage, and ecological risk indices. But without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
