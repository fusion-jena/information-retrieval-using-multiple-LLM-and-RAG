The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of Apache Spark, which is an open-source data processing engine, for accelerating deep learning inference for large-scale satellite image analytics. This suggests that the model may have been deployed on a platform that supports Apache Spark, but the exact platform is not specified.
