Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to landscape design and restorative potential assessment, with a focus on 3D spatial metrics and iterative design refinement. It does not discuss data preprocessing or deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
