The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the network architecture, patch extraction, and classification process. It does mention the use of morphological dilation to expand the boundaries of deforested polygons, but this is not a typical data augmentation technique.

However, it does mention the use of overlapping sliding windows with a stride of three for patch extraction, which can be considered a form of data augmentation as it allows the model to see different parts of the image. But it does not provide information on other common data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
