The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the CNN architectures, can vary depending on the problem being addressed. According to the provided context, CNNs can be used to solve different problems, including:

* Classification: outperforming even human performance in image classification (He et al., 2016)
* Regression: receiving an image and passing it through a series of convolutional layers connected to a fully connected network, with a linear or sigmoid output function, to estimate continuous transitions and patterns in the landscape, such as plant covers (Lathuiliere et al., 2020)
* Semantic segmentation: using models like UNet to perform segmentation tasks
* Object detection: not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but a common application of CNNs
* Instance-based segmentation: not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but a common application of CNNs

In the specific context of the provided text, the deep learning model is used for regression, specifically to estimate continuous transitions and patterns in the landscape, such as plant covers. The model receives an image and passes it through a series of convolutional layers connected to a fully connected network, with a linear or sigmoid output function.
