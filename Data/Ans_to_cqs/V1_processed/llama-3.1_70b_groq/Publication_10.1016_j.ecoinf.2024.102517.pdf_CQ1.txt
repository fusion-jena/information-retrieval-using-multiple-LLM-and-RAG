Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the noise reduction methods and algorithms used for processing bird sound recordings, as well as the experimental setup and comparative algorithms used.

However, it is mentioned that the dataset used in the study consists of "field recordings" of bird sounds, suggesting that the raw data may have been collected through field recordings or observations. Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset contains 1568 clean bird sound segments, which were randomly selected from a larger collection.

Unfortunately, without further information, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to the query. The context does not provide information on whether surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods were used to collect the raw data.
