Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for insect detection and identification, and the development of datasets and models for this purpose. It does not delve into the technical details of the deep learning architectures or the regularization methods used.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of deep learning-based methods for image processing and classification, which often employ regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific regularization methods used in these studies.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
