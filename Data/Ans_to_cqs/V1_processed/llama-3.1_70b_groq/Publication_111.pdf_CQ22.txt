The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, as well as the machine learning and statistical models, are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of regression problems, specifically for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) in this context. 

MAE measures the average difference between the actual and predicted values, while MSE calculates the average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values. RMSE is not explicitly defined in the provided context, but it is typically the square root of MSE. R2 is also mentioned as an evaluation metric, but its definition is not provided in the given context. 

It's worth noting that traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not mentioned in the provided context, which is likely because the problem is a regression task rather than a classification task.
