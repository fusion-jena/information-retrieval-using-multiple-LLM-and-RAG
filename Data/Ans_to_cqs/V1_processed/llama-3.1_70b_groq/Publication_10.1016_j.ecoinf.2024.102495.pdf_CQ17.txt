The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, except for dropout. According to the text, dropout is used in some of the models (e.g., Model 9), but it is not clear if other regularization methods like L2 regularization are used. Therefore, based on the provided context, the only regularization method mentioned is dropout.
