The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the research aims to expand to datasets involving various types of data, such as environmental rasters, satellite images, or time series data. This suggests that the pipeline may be designed to handle different types of data, including possibly CSV, image, and time series data. However, the specific formats used are not specified.
