Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, ecology, and conservation, with a few papers mentioning the use of machine learning and deep learning for tasks like image analysis and species counting. However, the specific question about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is not addressed.

One paper, "Xu, Z., Wang, T., Skidmore, A.K., Lamprey, R., 2024. A review of deep learning" is mentioned in the context, but the title does not provide any information about the content of the paper, and the context does not provide any further details.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
