Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the architecture of the model, the methods used to handle varying length audio data, and the performance of the model, but it does not provide information on how the model was deployed. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
