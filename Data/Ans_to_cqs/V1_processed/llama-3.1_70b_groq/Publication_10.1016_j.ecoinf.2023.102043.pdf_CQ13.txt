Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only describes the architecture of the YAMNet model, the preprocessing steps for the audio data, and the results of the classification algorithm. It does not provide information about the training process or the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
