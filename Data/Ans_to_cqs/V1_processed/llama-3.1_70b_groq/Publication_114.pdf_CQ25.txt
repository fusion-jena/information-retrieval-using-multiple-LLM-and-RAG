The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for tree species classification, where the goal is to identify 18 different tree species (17 dominant tree species and a class of "Others") from images. The model is formulated as a supervised image classification problem, and it uses patch-wise classification to achieve this goal. The deep learning models used in this study, including AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50, are all convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are commonly used for image classification tasks.
