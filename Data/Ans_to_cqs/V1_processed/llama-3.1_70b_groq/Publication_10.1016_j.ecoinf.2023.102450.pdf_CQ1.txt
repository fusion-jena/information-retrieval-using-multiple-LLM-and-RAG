Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the authorship contribution statement, data availability, acknowledgments, and references related to a research paper on animal tracking using deep learning. It does mention that "Data will be made available on request," but it does not provide information on how the data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
