Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the use of TensorFlow for classification tasks. It also discusses the results of the classification challenges, but it does not delve into the preprocessing steps or techniques used to address data bias.

However, it does mention that the data used for the research is publicly available via Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds. This suggests that the data collection process may have been designed to be diverse and representative, but the context does not provide further information on this.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
