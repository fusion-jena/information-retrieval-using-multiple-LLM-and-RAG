The provided context mentions several data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for object detection and counting tasks, particularly in the context of agricultural pest detection. According to the context, the following data annotation techniques are used:

1. **Bounding box annotation**: The context mentions that bounding boxes are generated by creating squares centered over the dots (representing pests) with a fixed side length s. This is used to create ground-truth data for object detection models.
2. **Density map generation**: The context mentions that density maps are produced by overlaying Gaussian kernels centered at the dot positions. This is used to create ground-truth data for density-based object counting models.
3. **Segmentation map generation**: The context mentions that segmentation maps are generated by superimposing dot-centered discs having radius r and splitting overlapping discs using a background ridge. This is used to create ground-truth data for instance segmentation models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of "dot labels" as a starting point for generating ground-truth data, but it does not provide further details on what these dot labels represent or how they are created.

Overall, the context suggests that the deep learning pipeline uses a combination of bounding box annotation, density map generation, and segmentation map generation to create ground-truth data for object detection and counting tasks.
