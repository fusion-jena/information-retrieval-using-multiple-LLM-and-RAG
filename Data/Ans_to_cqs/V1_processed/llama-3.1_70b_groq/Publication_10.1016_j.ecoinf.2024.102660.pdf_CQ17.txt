The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization as regularization methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention two other methods used to mitigate overfitting:

1. Reducing the number of convolutional kernels: The study reduces the number of 3 Ã— 3 convolutional kernels in the convolutional block from 64 to 32 to mitigate overfitting.
2. Incorporating residual structures: The Res_AUNet network incorporates residual structures, which are known to help mitigate overfitting issues in the network.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, such as random rotations and flips, to enhance the network's robustness during training. However, it does not provide information on other regularization methods that may be used in the pipeline.
