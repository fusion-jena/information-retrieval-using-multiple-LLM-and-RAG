None of the provided context mentions the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. In fact, the text mentions that the PLUS model employs the random forest algorithm, which is a type of machine learning algorithm, but not a deep learning framework. Additionally, it mentions that the FLUS model uses an artificial neural network (ANN), but it does not specify the framework used to build the ANN.
