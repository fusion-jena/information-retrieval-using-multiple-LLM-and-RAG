The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the focus is on the use of deep learning models for supervised classification of time series data. This suggests that the data format is likely to be a type of temporal data, such as CSV (Comma Separated Values) or a similar format that can store time series data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the majority of applications of deep learning models in ecology are to the classification of image and sound data, but the authors want to draw attention to the capacity of deep learning models to classify all kinds of temporal data. This implies that the data format used in the pipeline is likely to be different from image, audio, or video formats.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is likely that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is a type of temporal data format, such as CSV, but the exact format is not specified.
