I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The text appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, specifically discussing the use of MaxEnt models and environmental variables to predict species distributions. It mentions the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, but only in the context of a reference paper (Peterson et al., 2008) and not in relation to the evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
