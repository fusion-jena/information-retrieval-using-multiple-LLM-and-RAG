The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). These metrics are used to evaluate and compare the performance of both individual models and the ensemble model. The AUC values are categorized as excellent (>0.9), good (0.9-0.8), moderate (0.8-0.7), and poor (<0.7), while the TSS values are categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4). This comprehensive assessment ensures a robust understanding of model performance and aids in reliable predictions of species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.
