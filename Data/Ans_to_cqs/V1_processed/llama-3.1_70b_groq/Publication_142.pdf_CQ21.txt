Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to data analysis, machine learning, and plant species identification, but it does not provide specific information about the postprocessing steps.

However, based on general knowledge of machine learning, common postprocessing steps after model training may include:

* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. to evaluate the performance of the model.
* Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It provides a summary of the predictions against the actual outcomes.
* Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a type of visualization technique used to understand which input features are most important for a model's predictions.

However, it's essential to note that these steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, and the actual postprocessing steps involved may vary depending on the specific project or application.

Therefore, I can only provide a general answer based on common practices in machine learning, but I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer based on the provided context.
