Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only provides the results of calculations with different parameters (conv_base.trainable and Dropout Rate) for ResNet50 and VGG19 + ResNet50, as shown in Tables 8 and 9. These tables suggest that the authors have experimented with different values of Dropout Rate and conv_base.trainable, but the method used to optimize these hyperparameters is not specified.

There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization technique in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the available information.
