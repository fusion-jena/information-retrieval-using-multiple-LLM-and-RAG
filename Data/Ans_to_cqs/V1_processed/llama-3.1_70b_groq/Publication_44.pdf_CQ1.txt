Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and components of a deep learning model, specifically a fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation, and does not discuss data collection methods.

However, it does mention the use of images as input data, as evidenced by the discussion of image processing techniques such as connected component analysis. It also mentions the use of a feature extractor, such as ResNet-101 or Xception, which suggests that the model is being trained on a dataset of images.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific methods used for collecting the raw data. It is possible that the data was collected through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods, but this information is not provided in the context.
