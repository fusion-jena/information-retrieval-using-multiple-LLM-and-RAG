Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the research is focused on predicting water quality using machine learning algorithms, and the data seems to be in a tabular format, with various parameters such as conductivity, BOD, nitrate, and DO being analyzed.

Given this information, it is likely that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is CSV (Comma Separated Values), which is a common format for tabular data. However, without explicit mention of the data format, this is only an educated guess.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of image, audio, or video data formats, which are commonly used in deep learning applications such as computer vision and speech recognition. The focus of the research appears to be on analyzing and predicting water quality using machine learning algorithms, which typically involves working with tabular data.
