The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the AdamW optimizer. According to the text, "The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017)." Additionally, the weight decay and learning rate are set to 0.0001, and a learning rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95 is employed.
