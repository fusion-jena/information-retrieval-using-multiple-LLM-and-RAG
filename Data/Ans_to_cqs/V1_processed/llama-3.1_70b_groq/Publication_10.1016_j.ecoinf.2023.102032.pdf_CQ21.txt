Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific post-processing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The text only mentions that the approach "required no further user input, pre- or post-processing steps", which suggests that the model did not require additional processing after training. However, it does not provide information on the specific post-processing steps that were not required.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
