I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or its availability on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context appears to be a list of references and data related to soil salinity, groundwater, and land use, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
