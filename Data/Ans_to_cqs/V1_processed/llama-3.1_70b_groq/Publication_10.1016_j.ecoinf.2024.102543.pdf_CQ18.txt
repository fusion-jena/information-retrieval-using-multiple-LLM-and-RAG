The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation set. According to the context, the validation set (13% of the data, consisting of 607 images) is utilized during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures generalization. The validation set serves as a way to evaluate the model's performance on data that is not used for training, allowing for adjustments to be made to the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
