Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning models or their purposes. The context discusses various machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines, and their applications in supervised learning of animal behavior based on acceleration (ACC) data. However, it does not specifically mention deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the purpose of the deep learning model as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
