According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Image scaling
2. Horizontal and vertical flip
3. Perspective distortion
4. Adding color jitter for brightness, contrast, and saturation.

These techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training data and mitigate overfitting. However, it is not mentioned whether rotation is one of the applied techniques.
