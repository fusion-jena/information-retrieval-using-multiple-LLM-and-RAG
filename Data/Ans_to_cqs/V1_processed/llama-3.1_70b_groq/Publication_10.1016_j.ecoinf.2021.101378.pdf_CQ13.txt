I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context discusses the use of machine learning methods, such as random forest (RF) and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), for ecological studies, including species distribution and insect forest risk assessment. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, as deep learning is not mentioned in the context.
