I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to academic papers and research on digital soil mapping, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not include any information about a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
