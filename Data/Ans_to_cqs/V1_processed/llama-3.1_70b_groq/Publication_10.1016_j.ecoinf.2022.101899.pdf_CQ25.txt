The purpose of the deep learning model is to predict wildfire events in Australia. Specifically, the model is used to estimate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions, and to investigate historical environmental conditions before and after wildfires occurred. The model is also used to analyze the impact of different factors, such as forest vulnerability and mean wind speed, on wildfire occurrence probabilities. 

The context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning task (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection), but based on the information provided, it appears that the model is used for prediction and analysis of wildfire events, which suggests that it may be a classification or regression task. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the exact type of deep learning task.
