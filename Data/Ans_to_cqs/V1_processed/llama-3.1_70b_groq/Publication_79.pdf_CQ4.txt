Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning techniques for image segmentation and classification tasks, particularly in the context of Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) physiognomies. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-net architectures, and other deep learning methods, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to apply data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which can help improve the model's robustness and generalization performance. Techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping are often used to augment the dataset. But without explicit information in the context, we cannot confirm the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this particular deep learning pipeline.
