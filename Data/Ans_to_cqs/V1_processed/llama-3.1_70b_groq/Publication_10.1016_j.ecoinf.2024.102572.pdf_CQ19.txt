Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments and quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
