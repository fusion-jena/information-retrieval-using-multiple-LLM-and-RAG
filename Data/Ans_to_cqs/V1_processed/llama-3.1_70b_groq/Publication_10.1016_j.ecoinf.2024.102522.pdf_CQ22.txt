The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model, but it does discuss the evaluation of model performance using certain metrics. 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model include:

1. Correct prediction rate (or accuracy) for "present" and "absent" sample points.
2. Overall validation accuracy.
3. Cox & Snell R2 and Nagelkerke R2 (mentioned in Table 3, but not explicitly defined in the provided context).

Additionally, the classification table (Table 4) provides information on the observed and forecasted values, as well as the correct percentage and overall percentage for each step. However, it does not provide explicit values for precision and recall.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model include accuracy (correct prediction rate and overall validation accuracy), and possibly R2 values, but precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned.
