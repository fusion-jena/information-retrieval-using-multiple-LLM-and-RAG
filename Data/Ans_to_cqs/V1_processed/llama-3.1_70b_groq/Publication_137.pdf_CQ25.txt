The purpose of the deep learning model is segmentation. According to the provided context, the model is used for point cloud segmentation, specifically for tree species segmentation. The model takes point clouds as input and outputs a segmentation of the point cloud into different tree species. The model uses a combination of techniques, including geometric partition, superpoint embedding, and graph convolutional networks, to achieve this goal. The final output of the model includes point cloud geometric partition graphs, superpoint graphs (SPGs), and segmentation results.
