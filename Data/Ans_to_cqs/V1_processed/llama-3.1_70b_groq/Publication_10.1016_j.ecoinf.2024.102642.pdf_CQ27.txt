Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, and annotation methods used for the study. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
