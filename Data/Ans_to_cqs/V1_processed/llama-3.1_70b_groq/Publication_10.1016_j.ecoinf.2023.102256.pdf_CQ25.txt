The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to classify bird species based on spectrogram inputs. The baseline model produces a probability for each of the 22 species, indicating that the model is intended for multi-class classification. The text also mentions that the model is used for a bird classification task, further supporting this conclusion.
