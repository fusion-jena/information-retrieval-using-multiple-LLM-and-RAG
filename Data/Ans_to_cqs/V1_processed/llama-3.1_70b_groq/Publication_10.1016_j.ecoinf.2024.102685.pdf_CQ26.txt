The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that during the data preparation process for the random forest classification model, points that were not falling within the region of interest (ROI) and points considered mixed (i.e., those with co-occurrence of multiple species) were removed. This removal of mixed points represented 16.7% of the original data.

It can be inferred that this removal of mixed points might be a form of data preprocessing to address potential bias or noise in the data. However, it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
