Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely related to environmental and air quality data.

From the context, it appears that the researchers are working with datasets related to air pollution, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, particulate matter (PM) concentrations, and Sentinel-5P datasets. These datasets are likely in a tabular or numerical format, such as CSV.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Sentinel-3b SYN satellite images, which suggests that image data may also be used in the pipeline. However, it is unclear whether the images are used as input to the deep learning model or if they are used for other purposes, such as data visualization.

Overall, while the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated, it is likely that the pipeline uses a combination of numerical/tabular data (e.g., CSV) and possibly image data.
