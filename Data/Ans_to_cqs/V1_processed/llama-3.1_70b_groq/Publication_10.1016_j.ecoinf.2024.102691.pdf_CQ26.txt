Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and training of a deep learning model, specifically a YOLOv5 network, and discusses topics such as attention mechanisms, depth map processing, and model training parameters. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing or techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
