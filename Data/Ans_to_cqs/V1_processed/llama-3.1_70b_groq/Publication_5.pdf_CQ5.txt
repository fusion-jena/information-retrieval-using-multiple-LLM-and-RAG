The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the data used in the study involves remote sensing data, LiDAR data, and drone images. The context also mentions that the data is used for tasks such as mapping vascular plant species richness, predicting Arctic sea ice concentrations, and segmenting raised bog vegetation communities. 

It appears that the datasets used in the study are domain-specific and not the commonly used benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context does not provide enough information to identify the specific datasets used in the study.
