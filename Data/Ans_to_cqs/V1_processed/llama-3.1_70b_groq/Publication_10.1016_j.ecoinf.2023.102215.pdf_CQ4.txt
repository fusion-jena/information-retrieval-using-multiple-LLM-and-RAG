Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on the architecture and design of the neural network, including the use of dilated convolution, nested encoder-decoder models, and attention mechanisms. It also references various papers and studies related to image segmentation, saliency detection, and semantic segmentation, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
