Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on event-stream processing, machine learning, and deep learning, but it does not delve into the specifics of data collection.

However, it can be inferred that sensors might be used for collecting raw data, as the context mentions "processing power close to the sensor" in the discussion on edge computing. Additionally, the context mentions "remote locations" and "low bandwidth solutions" such as LoRa or Starlink, which suggests that data might be collected from remote or hard-to-reach areas.

The context also mentions various fields such as biology, ecology, and ethology, which might involve data collection through methods such as surveys, observations, or experiments. However, these methods are not explicitly mentioned in the context.

Therefore, while we can make some educated guesses about the potential methods used for collecting raw data, we cannot provide a definitive answer based on the provided context.
