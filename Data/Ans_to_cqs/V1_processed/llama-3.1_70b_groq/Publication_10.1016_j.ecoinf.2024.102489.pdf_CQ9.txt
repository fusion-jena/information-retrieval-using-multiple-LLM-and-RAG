Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and ecological informatics, discussing the use of satellite images and LAI (Leaf Area Index) products. However, it does not provide information on the data repository of a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
