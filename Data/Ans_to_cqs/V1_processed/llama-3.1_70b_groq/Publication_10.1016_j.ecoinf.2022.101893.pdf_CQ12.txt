The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The text mentions the use of a CNN pre-training model, which is constructed with multi-view data as input and outputs 500 features obtained from the Dense_1 layer. The architecture of the CNN model is also described in detail, including the use of convolutional and pooling layers, a dropout layer, and fully connected layers.
