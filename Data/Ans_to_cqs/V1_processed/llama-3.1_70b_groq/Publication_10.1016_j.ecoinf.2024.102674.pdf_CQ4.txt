Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on climate modeling, species distribution, and microclimatic studies, with some references to machine learning and statistical computing. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.

The only reference to deep learning is in the paper "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022). However, this paper is not explicitly mentioned as using data augmentation techniques, and the context does not provide further information on this topic.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
