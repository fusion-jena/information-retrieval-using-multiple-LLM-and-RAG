I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, color blindness, and scientific communication, with references to R packages and articles on color maps and visualization. There is no mention of deep learning or hyperparameters, so I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
