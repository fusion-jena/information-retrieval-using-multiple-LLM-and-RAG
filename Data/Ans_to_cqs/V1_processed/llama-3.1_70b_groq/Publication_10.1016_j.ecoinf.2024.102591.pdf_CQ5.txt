Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on geospatial data, wildfire science, and remote sensing, with mentions of datasets such as the European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) datasets, as well as the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) database. However, it does not mention the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
