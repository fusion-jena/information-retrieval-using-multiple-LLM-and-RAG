Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance of various deep learning models, such as SLSTM and SGRU, in time-series prediction tasks, particularly in agricultural product sales and climate-related data. It also discusses the use of SVR, a machine learning method, and its hyperparameter optimization.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps are crucial in preparing data for deep learning models. Common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. Normalization involves scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can improve model performance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming relevant features to improve model performance.

Since the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer. If you have any further questions or would like more general information on preprocessing steps, I'd be happy to help.
