Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of hyperparameters for the machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and LightGBM, using Optuna. It also discusses the evaluation metrics used to compare the performance of the models, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2).

However, it does mention that the performance of the algorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (MSE) of the optimized models, which suggests that some form of evaluation or validation was performed. Additionally, the context mentions that the SHAP values were calculated for each of the 365 explanatory variables, which could indicate that some form of feature importance analysis was performed.

Unfortunately, without further information, it is unclear whether measures such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
