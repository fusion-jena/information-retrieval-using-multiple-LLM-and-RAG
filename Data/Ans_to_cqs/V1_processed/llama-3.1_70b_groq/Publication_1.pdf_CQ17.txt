Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning for biodiversity monitoring, the training of computational models, and the processing of wildlife data streams, but it does not delve into the details of regularization methods.

However, it does mention that the learning algorithm is usually stochastic gradient descent, which is a common optimization algorithm used in deep learning. But it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in conjunction with this algorithm.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
