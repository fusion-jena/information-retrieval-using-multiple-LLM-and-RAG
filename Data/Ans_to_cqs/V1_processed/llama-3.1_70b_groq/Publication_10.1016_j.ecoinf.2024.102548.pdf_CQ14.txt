I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the importance of total model parameters, the number of layers in the model, and the parameter settings used in the experiments, such as the use of pre-trained weights, batch size, and number of epochs. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization method used, such as grid search or random search.
