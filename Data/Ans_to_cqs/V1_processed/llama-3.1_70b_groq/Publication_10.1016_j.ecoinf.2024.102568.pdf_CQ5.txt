Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on air quality monitoring and the use of LSTM models for predicting air quality parameters. It mentions a dataset from Modena, an Italian city, but does not provide the name of the dataset or any other information about it. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
