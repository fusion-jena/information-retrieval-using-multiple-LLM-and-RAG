I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the application of machine learning algorithms, including random forests and neural networks, for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping and crop mapping. It also mentions the use of remote sensing imagery and the Google Earth Engine platform, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
