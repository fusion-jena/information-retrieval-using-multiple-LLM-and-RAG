Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning to species assemblage prediction and conservation indices, without delving into the details of the deep learning pipeline or regularization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
