Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only provides information about the architecture of the proposed model, the execution time of different CNN models, and the discussion about protecting the privacy of confidential information when processing data using models. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
