The provided context does not mention the use of well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it refers to three custom datasets: GH, LH, and LL. 

- The GH dataset is not explicitly described in the provided context, but it is used as a source dataset to predict images from the LH and LL target datasets.
- The LH dataset consists of high-resolution images, likely representing a high-quality dataset.
- The LL dataset, also known as the Local Low Quality dataset, consists of single-specimen photographs taken using a conventional stereoscope and a microscope camera. These images are intended to represent a more realistic scenario of local taxonomists' photographs.

These custom datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the CNN model in within-dataset classification and between-dataset classification scenarios.
