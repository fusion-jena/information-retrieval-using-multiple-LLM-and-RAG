The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context appears to be image processing and analysis tasks. Specifically, there are three types of models mentioned: PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks.

PConv networks and Pix2Pix networks seem to be used for image-to-image translation tasks, such as image inpainting or image generation. The context mentions that PConv networks were trained with a per-pixel loss, perceptual loss, style loss, and total variation loss, which are common loss functions used in image-to-image translation tasks.

Classification networks, on the other hand, are used for image classification tasks. The context mentions that the classification networks were trained for plant species identification tasks, and that pre-trained models such as VGG16 were used as a starting point.

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning models in this context is to perform various image processing and analysis tasks, including image-to-image translation and image classification.
