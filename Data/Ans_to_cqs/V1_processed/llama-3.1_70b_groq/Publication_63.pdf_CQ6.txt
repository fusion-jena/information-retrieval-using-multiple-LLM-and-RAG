The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait was extracted before model training, which was used as a test dataset for independent evaluation of the trained models. The remaining data was split into a training dataset and a validation dataset by a ratio of 4:1.

Additionally, the context mentions that the CNN models used pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on a dataset on www.image-net.org, which suggests that the images may have been pre-processed in some way before being used for training. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a batch size of 20 images, an RMSprop optimizer, and a learning rate decay, which are all hyperparameters that can affect the training process, but are not directly related to preprocessing steps.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
