Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and improvements of the EfficientNetV2 network, as well as its application in object detection and image classification tasks.

However, it can be inferred that the use of a progressive learning approach, which dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size, might help improve the model's generalizability. Additionally, the fact that the EfficientNetV2 network is designed to be efficient and lightweight, with a reduced number of parameters and computations, might also contribute to its ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.

But, without further information, it is impossible to determine whether measures such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
