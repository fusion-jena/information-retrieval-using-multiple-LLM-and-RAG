Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training data, and performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score.

However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used some metrics calculation and possibly confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of their models, as they have reported various performance metrics in Table 3. But, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or any other postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that metrics calculation was likely involved, but I do not know about other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix.
