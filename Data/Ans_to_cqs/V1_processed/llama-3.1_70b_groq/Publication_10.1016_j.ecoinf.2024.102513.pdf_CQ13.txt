Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on explaining the architecture of the neural network, including the convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and output layer. It also discusses the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, but it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
