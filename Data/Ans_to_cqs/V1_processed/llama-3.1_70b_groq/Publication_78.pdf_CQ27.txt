Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the feature extraction process, the architecture of the custom D-CNN (CoralNet), and the use of pre-trained D-CNN (AlexNet) for coral classification. It also discusses the classification process using SVM and the comparison of different classifiers. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, model serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
