Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include:

1. Metrics calculation: The context mentions the calculation of various metrics such as accuracy, top-3 accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, as shown in Table 2.

2. Confusion matrix: The context mentions that the confusion matrices of the base and the best configuration for each frontend are shown in Fig. 4.

There is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Therefore, it is not clear if saliency maps are used as a postprocessing step in this study.

Additionally, the context mentions that the first five seconds of the validation recordings were used to monitor the models during training, which suggests that some form of validation or evaluation is performed during the training process. However, the exact details of this process are not provided.
