Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "spatial inputs" and "data extracted from Fig. 2 related to the states of each cell" with dimensions 257 × 257 × 9, it can be inferred that the data format might be related to images or spatial data. The context also mentions "masks of states" which is a common term used in image segmentation tasks. Therefore, it is possible that the data format used in the pipeline is image data. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to confirm this with certainty.
