I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and discusses various approaches to building SDMs, including generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and Maxent. It also mentions the challenges of working with limited presence sites and sampling bias, but does not provide any information about deep learning models or data splitting criteria.
