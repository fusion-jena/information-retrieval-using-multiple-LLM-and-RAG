I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization or model training. It appears to be a collection of references and a snippet of text discussing the use of spectral vegetation indices for monitoring forest pests and diseases. There is no information about a specific model or its hyperparameters, so I cannot provide an answer to the query.
