The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. According to the text, "22,120 annotations (i.e., machine learning-detected bounding boxes around snow leopards in photos)" were obtained from 359 sightings of snow leopards at hourly intervals. This suggests that the annotations were created using a computer vision model based on machine learning, which detected the snow leopards in the photos and drew bounding boxes around them. Additionally, Fig. 2 shows an annotated snow leopard with a bounding box around it, further confirming the use of bounding box annotation. There is no mention of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques in the provided context.
