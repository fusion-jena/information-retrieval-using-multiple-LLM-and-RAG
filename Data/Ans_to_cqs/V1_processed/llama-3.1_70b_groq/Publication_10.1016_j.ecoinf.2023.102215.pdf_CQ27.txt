Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the TrunkNet model, as well as its performance evaluation. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
