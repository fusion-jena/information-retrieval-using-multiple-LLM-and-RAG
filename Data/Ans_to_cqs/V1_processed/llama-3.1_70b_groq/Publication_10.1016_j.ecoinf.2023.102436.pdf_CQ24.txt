Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on landscape planning, urban design, and ecological informatics, with some references to convolutional neural networks and image-based methods. However, it does not delve into the technical details of deep learning pipelines or randomness handling.

That being said, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can arise from various sources, such as random weight initialization, dropout, or data augmentation. To handle randomness, researchers and practitioners often employ techniques like:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility.
2. Using techniques like batch normalization or weight normalization to reduce the impact of random weight initialization.
3. Employing regularization techniques, such as dropout or L1/L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting.
4. Using ensemble methods, which combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds or initializations.

However, without more specific information from the context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
