The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, the model is used for Forest classification, where the target classes are "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian", designated as "p", "w", and "r" respectively. The model is trained on 2D LiDAR images and utilizes a Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation approach to assess its performance.
