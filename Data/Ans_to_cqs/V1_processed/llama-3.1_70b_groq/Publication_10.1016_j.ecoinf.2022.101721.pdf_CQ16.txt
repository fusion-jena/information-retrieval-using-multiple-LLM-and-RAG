I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training, validation loss plateau, or criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to statistical modeling, Bayesian algorithms, and data analysis, but it does not provide any information about training or validation loss plateau. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
