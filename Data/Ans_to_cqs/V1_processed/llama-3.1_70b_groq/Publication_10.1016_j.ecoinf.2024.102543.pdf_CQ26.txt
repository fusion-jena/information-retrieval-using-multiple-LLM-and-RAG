The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention that augmentation played a crucial role in further diversifying the dataset by introducing random saturation adjustments to each training example, which increased the number of outputs per example and introduced variations in color intensity. This augmentation strategy contributed to a more comprehensive and robust training dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was standardized and enriched through techniques like auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, and filtering, which ensured that the images were consistently oriented, had a uniform size, and contained a substantial amount of annotated data, meeting the 90% annotation threshold.

While these techniques may help improve the quality and diversity of the dataset, they do not specifically address data bias. Therefore, I do not know if any other techniques, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection, were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
