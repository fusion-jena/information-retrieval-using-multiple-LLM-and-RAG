To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the dataset was randomly divided into three parts: training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) sets. This division was performed in a stratified manner to maintain class proportions across all of the parts. This means that the same proportion of each class was maintained in each of the three sets, which helps to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on a representative sample of the data.

Additionally, the model was trained on a relatively large dataset (2880 images in the training set) and evaluated on a separate validation set (961 images) and testing set (958 images). This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

The use of stratified splitting and a separate validation and testing set helps to ensure that the model is robust and generalizable to new data. However, it is not clear from the provided context whether other measures such as data augmentation or cross-validation were used to further improve the model's generalizability.
