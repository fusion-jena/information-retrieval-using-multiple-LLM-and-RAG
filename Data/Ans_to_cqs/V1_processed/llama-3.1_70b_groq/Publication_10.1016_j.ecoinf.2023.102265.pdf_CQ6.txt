Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the comparison of different ResNet models (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101) for feature extraction and the performance of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for classification.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for training the model consists of 500 honey bee images, with 250 images of natural backgrounds and 250 images of anthropogenic backgrounds. The text also mentions that the images were manually labeled using an algorithm, but it does not provide details on any preprocessing steps that may have been applied to the images before training the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
