Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and references related to ecological informatics, climate modeling, and species distribution models. It does not provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model.

However, it does mention the use of R packages such as RANDOMFOREST, GBM, and NEURALNETTOOLS for modeling and analysis, but it does not provide details on model deployment. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question accurately.
