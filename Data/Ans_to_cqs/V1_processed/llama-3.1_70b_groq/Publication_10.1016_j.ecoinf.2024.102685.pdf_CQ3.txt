I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of Random Forest classification for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats, and mentions the use of multispectral images and satellite data. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used in deep learning pipelines.
