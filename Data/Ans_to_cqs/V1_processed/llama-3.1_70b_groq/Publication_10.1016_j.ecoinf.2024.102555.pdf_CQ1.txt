The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the data sources used in the research, which include:

* NDVI data generated from AVHRR sensors by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS)
* Meteorological stations throughout China (as shown in Fig. 2)
* Google Earth Engine platform (mentioned in the reference "Intertwined impacts of urbanization and land cover change on urban climate and agriculture in Aurangabad city (MS), India using google earth engine platform.")

It can be inferred that the research uses remote sensing data from satellites (AVHRR sensors) and data from meteorological stations. However, it does not provide information on whether surveys or public datasets are used.
