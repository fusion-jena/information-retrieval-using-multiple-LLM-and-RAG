The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of validation data to limit overfitting, which can be related to addressing data bias.

The context mentions that the model's parameters are modified according to the loss function's gradient, and the validation data help to monitor the model's performance during training. This suggests that the validation data may be used to identify and mitigate any biases in the training data.

However, the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
