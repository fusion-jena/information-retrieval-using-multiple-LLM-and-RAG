Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the optimization algorithms, hyperparameters, and techniques used to prevent overfitting in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), as well as a specific type of attack called label-only attacks. It also mentions the use of reference images, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
