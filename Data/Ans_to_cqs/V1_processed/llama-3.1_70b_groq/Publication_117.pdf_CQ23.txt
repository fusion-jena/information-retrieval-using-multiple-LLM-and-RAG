The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that a training dataset was generated by selecting 500 of the survey images at random to be used exclusively for training. This random selection may help to ensure that the training data is representative of the overall dataset, but it does not provide information on other measures that may have been taken to ensure generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the deep learning model used pretrained weights from the COCO dataset, which may help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to evaluate and improve the model's performance.

Therefore, while some measures may have been taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the provided context does not provide a complete picture of the methods used.
