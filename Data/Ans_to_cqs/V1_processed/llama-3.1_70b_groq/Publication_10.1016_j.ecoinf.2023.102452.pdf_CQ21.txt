Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on Genetic Programming (GP) and its application in feature selection and modeling, as well as the use of Eureka Pro software for GP modeling. It also briefly mentions Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Wavelet signal analysis, but does not provide information on postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
