Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning methodologies with satellite data interpretation for aquatic environmental monitoring, specifically for estimating Chl-a concentrations. It mentions the use of neural networks, but it does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

However, it does mention that the IRTM-NN model is used to estimate water-inherent optical properties, and that the network is "properly trained to fit the coefficients." This suggests that some form of regularization or optimization technique may be used, but the specific methods are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
