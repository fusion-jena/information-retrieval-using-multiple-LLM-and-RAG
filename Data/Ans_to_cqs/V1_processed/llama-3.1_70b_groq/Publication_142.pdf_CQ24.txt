Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of AI classifiers for biodiversity research, potential biases in the data, and a checklist of questions for researchers to consider when using AI-generated data.

However, it does mention the use of a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and a softmax output, which are common components of deep learning pipelines. But it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in this specific pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
