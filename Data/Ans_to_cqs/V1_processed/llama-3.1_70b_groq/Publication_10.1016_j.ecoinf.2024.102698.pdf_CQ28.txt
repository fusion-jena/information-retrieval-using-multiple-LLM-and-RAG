I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses various topics such as coral reef bleaching, synthetic data generation, and deep learning models, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The only mention of a specific tool or package is the Synthetic Data Vault python package, but it is not related to the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
