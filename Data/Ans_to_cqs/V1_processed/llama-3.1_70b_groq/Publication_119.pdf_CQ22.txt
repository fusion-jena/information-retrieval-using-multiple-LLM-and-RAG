The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the provided context are overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. 

The overall accuracy is calculated using Equation (2), but the equation itself is not provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the overall accuracy of the models is compared with the edited map seen in Figure 8.

The kappa coefficient is calculated using Equation (3), which is also not provided in the given context. The kappa coefficient values for the SVM and U-Net models are 0.650 and 0.655, respectively.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a confusion/error matrix, which is typically used to calculate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. However, these metrics are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of independent testing data for model evaluation, which suggests that the models are evaluated on a separate dataset that is not used for training.
