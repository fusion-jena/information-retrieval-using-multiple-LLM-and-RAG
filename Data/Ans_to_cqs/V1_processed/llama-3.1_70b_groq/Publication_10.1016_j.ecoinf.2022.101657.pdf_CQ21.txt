Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the training process, dataset, and evaluation metrics used. 

However, it does mention the calculation of the mean average precision (mAP) score, specifically mAP50, which is used to evaluate the model's performance. The mAP metric takes the mean over all considered species of their respective, species-specific average precision. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the network outputs a belief value (b âˆˆ [0, 1]) for species identification, which implies that thresholding may be involved in determining the final species identification. 

But, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
