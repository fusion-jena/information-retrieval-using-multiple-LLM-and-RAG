Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the ensemble modeling approach used to predict the distribution of the study species, the models employed, and the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance.

However, it does mention that the authors used cross-validation to test the model's performance, where 70% of the dataset was used as training data and the remaining 30% as testing data. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) was used as the index to specify the accuracy of the models.

There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix as postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to the query based on the provided context.
