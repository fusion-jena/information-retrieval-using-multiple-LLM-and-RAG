The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm. The TPE algorithm is a probabilistic model that estimates the probability distribution of the hyperparameters and iteratively constructs a tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function. This allows for efficient searching in high-dimensional spaces. The TPE algorithm is used to select the most effective hyperparameters for the machine learning models, and the optimized hyperparameters are then used to train the models.
