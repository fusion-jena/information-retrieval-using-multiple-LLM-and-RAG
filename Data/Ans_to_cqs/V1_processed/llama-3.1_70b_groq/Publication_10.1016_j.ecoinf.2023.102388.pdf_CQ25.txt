The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it appears that the model is being used for a task related to automated monitoring of marine mammals and fish habitats through computer vision. The context mentions the use of a Siamese network architecture, which is often used for tasks such as image matching, verification, and identification. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a contrastive loss function, which is commonly used in deep learning models for tasks such as image classification, verification, and retrieval.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of a dataset with images of belugas and the goal of training a model to minimize the distance between similar images (of the same beluga) while maximizing the distance between dissimilar images (of different belugas). This suggests that the model is being used for a task related to image classification or identification, possibly for the purpose of monitoring and tracking marine mammals.

However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer to the query.
