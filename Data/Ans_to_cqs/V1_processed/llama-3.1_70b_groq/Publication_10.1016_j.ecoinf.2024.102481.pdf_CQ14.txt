Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) machine learning method for classification of reproductive condition in fish, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It mentions that the RF models naturally modelled potential interactions and that there was no need to carefully specify model complexity, but it does not elaborate on the hyperparameter tuning process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
