The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are pitch shift, time-shift, and added noise. Specifically, these techniques are applied to the delphinid tonal and biological click classes, which had limited frames available. The parameters for each transformation are randomly selected from a pre-defined range: pitch-shift between 0.5 and 1.5, time-shift between -300 ms and 300 ms, and Gaussian white noise added with powers between 1 and 2. These techniques are used to increase the number of frames per class and ensure sufficient data for training and validation.
