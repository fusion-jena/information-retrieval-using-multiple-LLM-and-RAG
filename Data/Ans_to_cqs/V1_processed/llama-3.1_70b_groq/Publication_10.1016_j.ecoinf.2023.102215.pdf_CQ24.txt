Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a deep learning model for salient object detection, specifically for tree trunks, and discusses the dataset properties and model training process. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
