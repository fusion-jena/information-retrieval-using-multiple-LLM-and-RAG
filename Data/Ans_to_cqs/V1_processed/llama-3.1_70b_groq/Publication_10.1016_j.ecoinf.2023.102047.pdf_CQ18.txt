The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is early stopping. The validation loss is monitored during training time for every epoch on the validation set, and the model stops training if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs, which is set to 20 in this case. This is done to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
