Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the pre-processing stage reduces noises and standardizes inputs, which enhances metrics. Additionally, it mentions that the pre-processing stage is used to remove backgrounds and standardize inputs.

It also mentions that the pre-processed images are used to train the models, and the results are compared with the raw images. However, the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only infer that some form of preprocessing is involved, but the specific steps are not mentioned.
