The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for camera trap image analysis. However, it does mention the use of instance segmentation in the study by Schindler and Steinhage (2021), which combines Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation (Zhu et al., 2017) to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in video clips.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of bounding boxes in the evaluation metric mean average precision (mAP50), which suggests that bounding box annotation may be used in the pipeline. However, this is not explicitly stated as a data annotation technique.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that instance segmentation and possibly bounding box annotation might be used in the deep learning pipeline for camera trap image analysis, but the specific data annotation techniques used are not clearly stated.
