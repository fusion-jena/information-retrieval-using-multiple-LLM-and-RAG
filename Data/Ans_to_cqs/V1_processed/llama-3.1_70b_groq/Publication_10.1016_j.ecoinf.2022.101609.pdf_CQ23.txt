Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model's architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. It does mention the use of a validation dataset to evaluate the model's performance, as seen in Fig. 13, which shows the model's predictions against actual readings from the validation dataset. However, it does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or diverse dataset were used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I do not know the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
