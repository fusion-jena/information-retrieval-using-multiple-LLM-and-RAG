Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training hyper-parameters, model architectures, and performance evaluation of the models on the IP102 dataset. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
