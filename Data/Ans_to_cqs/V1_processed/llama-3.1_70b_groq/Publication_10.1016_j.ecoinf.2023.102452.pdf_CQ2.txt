The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to various studies and papers, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be time-series data, possibly in CSV format, as many of the papers mention applications in water resources, hydrology, and environmental modeling.

For example, the paper by Dehghani et al. (2023) mentions hourly short-term streamflow forecasting, which suggests the use of time-series data. Similarly, the paper by Feng et al. (2017) mentions short-term wind forecasting, which also implies the use of time-series data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of wavelet transforms, Fourier transforms, and other signal processing techniques, which are commonly used to analyze time-series data. However, the specific data format used in these studies is not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, while it is likely that CSV is one of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer without more information.
