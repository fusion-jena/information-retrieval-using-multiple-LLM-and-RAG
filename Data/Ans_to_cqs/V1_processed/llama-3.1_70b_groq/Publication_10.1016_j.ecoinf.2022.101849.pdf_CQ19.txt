Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text discusses various machine learning methods, including neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting, and k-nearest neighbors, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to implement these methods. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
