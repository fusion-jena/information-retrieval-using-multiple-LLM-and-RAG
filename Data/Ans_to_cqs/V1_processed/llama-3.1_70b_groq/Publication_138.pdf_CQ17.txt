The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Local Response Normalization (LRN) and maximum pooling with a 2 Ã— 2 window and 2 strides, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the number of parameters and enhancing the generalization of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a pooling operator after a certain layer, which can also help prevent overfitting by reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.

However, it does not mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, which are common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot confirm the use of these specific regularization methods.
