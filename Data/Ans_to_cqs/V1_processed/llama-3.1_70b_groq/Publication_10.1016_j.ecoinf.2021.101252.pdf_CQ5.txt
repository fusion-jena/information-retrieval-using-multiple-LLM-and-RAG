Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the use of deep learning models for time series classification tasks, but it does not provide information about the datasets used for training and testing these models.

The context mentions three case studies (Case study 1, Case study 2, and Case study 3), but it does not provide information about the datasets used in these case studies. It only provides information about the architectures of the models used (e.g., ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, CNN) and their performance on these tasks.

Therefore, I do not know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
