I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It discusses the tuning of parameters for a machine learning model, specifically a decision tree-based ensemble model, but it does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context does reference a few papers that discuss deep learning in remote sensing applications, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
