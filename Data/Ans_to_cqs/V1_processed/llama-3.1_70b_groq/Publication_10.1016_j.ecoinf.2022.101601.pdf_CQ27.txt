I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to research papers and studies on topics such as permafrost, soil moisture, and Bayesian networks, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
