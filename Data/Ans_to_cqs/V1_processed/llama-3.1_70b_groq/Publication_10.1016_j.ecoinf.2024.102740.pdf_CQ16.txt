The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the Random Forest (RF) technique is used for classification, and the most accurate results were obtained when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the RF generates an impartial internal estimate of the generalization error by the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples, which are those not included in the training subset. In this case, the total number of samples used for validation is 8. 

It can be inferred that the training process may be considered complete when the OOB error converges or reaches a stable value, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
