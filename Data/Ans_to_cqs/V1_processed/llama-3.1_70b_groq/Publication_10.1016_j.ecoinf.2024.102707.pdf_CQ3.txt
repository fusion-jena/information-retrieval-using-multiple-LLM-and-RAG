Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and conservation, with a focus on penguin and seabird research. While some of the references may mention data annotation or machine learning methods, the specific techniques used are not explicitly stated. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
