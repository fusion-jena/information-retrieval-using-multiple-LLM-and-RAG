The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some challenges related to data quality and quantity in remote sensing and deep learning applications.

The context mentions the use of semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning as approaches to address the data limitation in deep learning. These methods can potentially help with data bias by leveraging unlabeled data or generating pseudo labels for training. However, it does not provide information on specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.

It also mentions the importance of having high-quality annotations and the challenge of collecting and annotating data in remote sensing applications. This suggests that diverse data collection could be beneficial in addressing data bias, but it is not explicitly mentioned as a technique.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a direct answer to the query, but it highlights the importance of addressing data quality and quantity issues in deep learning applications.
