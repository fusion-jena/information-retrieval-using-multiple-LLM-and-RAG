The provided context does not explicitly mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. It mentions that the trained model is hosted using TensorFlow 2.2 and served through a public-facing website developed by the authors. However, it does not specify the underlying platform or infrastructure used to host the website. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
