I don't know.

The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, landscape ecology, and wildlife conservation, with no mention of deep learning or data preprocessing techniques. Therefore, I am unable to provide a relevant answer to the query.
