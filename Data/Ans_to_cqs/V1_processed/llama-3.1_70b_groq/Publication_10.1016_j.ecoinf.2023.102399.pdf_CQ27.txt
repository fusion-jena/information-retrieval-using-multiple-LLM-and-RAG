Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The text only discusses the development of a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural networks, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The context mentions the use of deep learning techniques, such as the Haar classifier, and the combination of computer vision with deep learning, but it does not provide details on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
