Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the research papers and studies related to deep learning, sentiment analysis, and urban vitality, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

However, it is mentioned that a comparative analysis of the accuracy of different models (Rostcm 6.0, Simple Bayesian Networks, LSTM, and CNN) was conducted in pre-tests, and the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework was chosen for determining the sentiment index. This suggests that some form of evaluation and comparison was performed, but the details of the evaluation process and the measures taken to ensure generalizability are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
