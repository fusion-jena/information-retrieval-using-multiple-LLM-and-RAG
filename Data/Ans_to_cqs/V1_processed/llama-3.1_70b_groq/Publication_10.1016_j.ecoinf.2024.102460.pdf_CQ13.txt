I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that the LSTM model is used for time series forecasting and that it has better performance compared to traditional machine learning models. It also mentions that the LSTM model is combined with a fuzzy multiobjective programming (FMOP) model and a parallelized urban land use simulation (PLUS) model in the LUCC dynamic analysis framework (LSTM-PLUS-FMOP). However, it does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
