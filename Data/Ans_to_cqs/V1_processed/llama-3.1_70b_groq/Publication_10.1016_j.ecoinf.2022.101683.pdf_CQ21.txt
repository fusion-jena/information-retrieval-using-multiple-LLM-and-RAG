The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention model evaluation metrics, which suggests that some form of evaluation or postprocessing is performed.

The context mentions that the model evaluation metrics calculated include AUC, Omission, TPR, Kappa, and TSS. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of a model. However, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is the calculation of model evaluation metrics. Other postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps or confusion matrices, are not mentioned and cannot be confirmed.
