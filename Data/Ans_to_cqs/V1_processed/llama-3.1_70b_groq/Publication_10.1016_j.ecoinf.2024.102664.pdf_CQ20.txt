Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. The context only discusses the structure of the CNN and LSTM models, the performance of the models in different chlorophyll concentration regions, and the results of the experiments. It does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the models, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
