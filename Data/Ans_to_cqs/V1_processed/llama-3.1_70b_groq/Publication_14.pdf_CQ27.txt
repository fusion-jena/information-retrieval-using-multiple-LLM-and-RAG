The provided context does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the author received support from Google engineers who shared code samples and answered questions on deploying machine learning models. 

Additionally, the context mentions that a DeepMeerkat executable for Mac and Windows is available, and reproducible scripts are provided for local and Google cloud environments to allow users to train new models. This suggests that the model was likely deployed using a combination of local and cloud-based platforms.

Regarding model serialization, the context does not provide any information on this topic. It only mentions that the feature vectors for the frozen layers were extracted in parallel using Google Cloud DataFlow, and these features were then used as the basis for retraining the new fine-tuned layers.

Therefore, while we can infer some aspects of the deployment process, the exact steps followed for model serialization and platform selection are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
