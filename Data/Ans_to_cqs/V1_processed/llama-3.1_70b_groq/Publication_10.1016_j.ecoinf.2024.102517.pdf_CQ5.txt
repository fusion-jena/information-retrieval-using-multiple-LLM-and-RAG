Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the authors obtained a dataset comprising clean bird sounds, which contained 1568 clean bird sound segments, with durations ranging from 4 to 20 seconds. Among these, 68 segments were randomly selected as the clean bird sound test set. This suggests that the dataset used is a custom dataset of bird sounds, rather than a standard dataset like MNIST or ImageNet.
