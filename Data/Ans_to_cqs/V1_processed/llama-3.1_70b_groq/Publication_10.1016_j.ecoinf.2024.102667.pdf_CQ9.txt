I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental research, including papers on desertification, drought, and vegetation responses to climate change, as well as figures showing spatial distributions of ecological engineering programs and NDVI in China. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository.
