Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be discussing the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for classifying blue whale vocalizations and noise signals, and it provides details on the training and testing stages of the HMM. However, it does not mention deep learning models or the process of splitting data for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you.
