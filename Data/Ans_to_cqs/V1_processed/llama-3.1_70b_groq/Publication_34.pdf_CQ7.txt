The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data is split into two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets: a train set (4781 sites) and a test set (400 sites). There is no mention of a validation set. The train set is used for fitting all models, and the test set is used to test the models' generalization capacities.
