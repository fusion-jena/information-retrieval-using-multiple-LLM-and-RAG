Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT for spell checking, grammar checking, and debugging in code, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
