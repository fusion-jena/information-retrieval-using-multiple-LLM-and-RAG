The text does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the data is related to audio signals, specifically blue whale vocalizations. The text mentions "waveform" and "feature vectors extracted from the test datasets", which suggests that the data is likely in an audio or time-series format. However, the specific data format (e.g., WAV, MP3, CSV) is not mentioned.
