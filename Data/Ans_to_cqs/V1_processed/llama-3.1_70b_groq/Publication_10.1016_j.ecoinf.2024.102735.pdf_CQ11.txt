Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "Data will be available on request and upon approval from Greenville County Land Development Division." This suggests that the data is not publicly available through a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but rather can be obtained by requesting access from the Greenville County Land Development Division.
