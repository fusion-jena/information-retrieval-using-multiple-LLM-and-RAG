Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The context discusses the loss function used, the optimizer, and the training parameters, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on high-resolution imagery data, possibly from satellite or aerial images. In general, preprocessing steps for such data may include:

* Data cleaning: removing noise, correcting for sensor errors, and handling missing values
* Data normalization: scaling the pixel values to a common range, such as 0-1 or -1-1
* Data augmentation: applying transformations to the images to increase the size of the training dataset
* Feature scaling: scaling the features to have similar magnitudes to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model

But without explicit information, it is impossible to know the exact preprocessing steps involved in this specific case.
