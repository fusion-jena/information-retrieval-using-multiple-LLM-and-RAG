Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are related to various studies on underwater object detection, bird surveys, and image processing, but they do not mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is mentioned that the supervised DL and ML approaches designed by the authors in their previous work (Kuru et al., 2023) were used to detect specific marine small natural objects (e.g., birds) in images. But the specific dataset used for this purpose is not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
