Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of feature extraction models, semi-supervised learning techniques, and the comparison of classification models. It discusses the training and testing of models, but it does not provide information on the deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
