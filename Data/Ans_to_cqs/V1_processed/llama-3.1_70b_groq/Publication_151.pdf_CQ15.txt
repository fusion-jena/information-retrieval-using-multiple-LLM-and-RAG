The provided context mentions that the batch size is fixed to 32 and the training loss is checked every 50 epochs. The training is stopped when the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. Additionally, it is mentioned that a running average of the recent magnitude is used to speed up training, which is a technique used in the Adam optimization algorithm (Tieleman and Hinton 2012). However, it does not explicitly mention the use of SGD or other optimization techniques.
