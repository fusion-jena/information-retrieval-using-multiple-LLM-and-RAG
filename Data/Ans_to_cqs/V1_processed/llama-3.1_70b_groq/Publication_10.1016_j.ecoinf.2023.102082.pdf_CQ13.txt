Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) was used to create the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images. It does not provide any information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
