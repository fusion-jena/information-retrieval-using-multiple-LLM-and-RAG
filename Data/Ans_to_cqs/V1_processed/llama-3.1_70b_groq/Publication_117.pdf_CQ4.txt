Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that the images were "tiled into 864 Ã— 864 subimages and then passed though a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset." This suggests that the images were divided into smaller subimages, but it does not provide information on any additional data augmentation techniques that may have been applied.
