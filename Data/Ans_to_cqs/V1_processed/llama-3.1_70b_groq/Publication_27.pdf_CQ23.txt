Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and numbers, possibly from a technical document or academic paper, but it does not provide any clear information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

However, I can suggest some common measures that are typically taken to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models, such as:

* Using a diverse dataset that represents the population of interest
* Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data
* Stratified splitting, where the data is split into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set
* Data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset
* Regularization techniques, such as dropout and L1/L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting

But without more specific information, I cannot determine which measures were taken in this particular case.
