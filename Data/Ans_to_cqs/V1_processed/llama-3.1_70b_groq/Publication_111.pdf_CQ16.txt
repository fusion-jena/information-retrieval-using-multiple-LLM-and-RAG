The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention the use of early stopping strategy to cease training when generalisation performance starts to degrade for a number of epochs. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set is being monitored during training, and training is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade. 

Additionally, the context provides a graph showing the training and validation loss over epochs, which suggests that the model's performance on both the training and validation sets is being monitored during training. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau, is not explicitly mentioned.
