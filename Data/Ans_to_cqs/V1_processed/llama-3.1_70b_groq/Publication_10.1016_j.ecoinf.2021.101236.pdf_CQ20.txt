Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the design and architecture of the model, the training process, and the data augmentation method, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training.

Therefore, I don't know which hardware resources (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) were used for training the deep learning model.
