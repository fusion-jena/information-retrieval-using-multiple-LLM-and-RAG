The purpose of the deep learning model is multi-label classification. This is evident from the use of a sigmoid function in the final layer of the model, which enables the model to predict the presence or absence of multiple species at a given location. The model is designed to address the specific setup of species distribution modeling (SDMs), where a single location can accommodate an arbitrary number of species.
