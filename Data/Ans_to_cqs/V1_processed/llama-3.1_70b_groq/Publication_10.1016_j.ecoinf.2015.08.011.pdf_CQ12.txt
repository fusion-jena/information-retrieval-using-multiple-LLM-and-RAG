The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a single hidden layer. The specific architecture of the ANN is described as having five input variables, 19 hidden neurons, and one output variable, with a learning rate of 0.7. There is no indication of the use of more complex deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.
