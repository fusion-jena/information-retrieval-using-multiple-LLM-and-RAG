Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the model's performance, data preprocessing, and spectrogram generation, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter tuning methods such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
