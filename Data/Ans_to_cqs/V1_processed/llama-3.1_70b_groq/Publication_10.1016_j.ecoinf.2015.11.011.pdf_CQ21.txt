Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific post-processing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the development of segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition, as well as the use of machine learning techniques and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for ecological informatics.

However, it does mention the importance of supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources, even with machine learning (Sexton et al., 2015). This suggests that some form of evaluation or validation may be involved after model training, but the specific steps are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about post-processing steps involved after model training.
