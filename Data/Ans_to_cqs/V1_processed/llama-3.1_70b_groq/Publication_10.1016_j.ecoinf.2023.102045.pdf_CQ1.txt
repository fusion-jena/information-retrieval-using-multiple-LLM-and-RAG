Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, mapping, and scientific communication, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning or data collection methods.

The context mentions that maps can be problematic information resources and that any data gathering and representation leads to a reduction of the original data complexity. However, it does not provide information on the methods used to collect raw data.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
