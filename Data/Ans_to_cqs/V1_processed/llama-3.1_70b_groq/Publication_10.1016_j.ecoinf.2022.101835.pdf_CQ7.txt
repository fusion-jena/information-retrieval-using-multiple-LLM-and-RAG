Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the optimization of machine learning models using Optuna, the performance evaluation of different algorithms (RF, ANN, and GBDT), and the interpretation of results using SHAP values. It does not provide information on data splitting or preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
