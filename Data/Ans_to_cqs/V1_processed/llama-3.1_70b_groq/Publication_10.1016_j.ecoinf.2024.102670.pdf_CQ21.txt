Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to focus on the analysis of filamentous organisms, specifically the Rhizophagus irregularis fungus, and the automated analysis of its morphological characteristics and dynamics. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used in the study. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
