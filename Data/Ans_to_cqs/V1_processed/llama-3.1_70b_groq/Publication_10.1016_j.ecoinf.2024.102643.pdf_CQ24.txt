I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of research papers and studies related to wildlife conservation, ecology, and human-wildlife conflicts. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context seems to be focused on topics such as bear behavior, human-bear conflicts, and wildlife conservation, which are unrelated to the query about deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I am unable to provide a relevant answer to the query based on the provided context.
