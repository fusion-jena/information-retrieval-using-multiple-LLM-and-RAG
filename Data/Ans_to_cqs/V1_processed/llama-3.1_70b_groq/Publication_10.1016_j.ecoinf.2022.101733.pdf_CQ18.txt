Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the sample selection process, the distribution of samples, and the advantages and disadvantages of the method used for collecting samples. However, it does mention that a few points (about 40 samples) are collected in field surveying for visual assessment of classification performance. This suggests that some form of evaluation or assessment is being done, but the specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training is not mentioned.
