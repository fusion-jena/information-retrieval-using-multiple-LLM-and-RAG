Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning techniques for animal tracking and behavior analysis, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps.

However, it can be inferred that the datasets used for training the models likely underwent some form of preprocessing, as is common practice in deep learning. This may have included steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, but the specific details are not provided.

One relevant mention is the use of "few-shot learning" and "two-way one-shot learning" in the context, which suggests that the training dataset may have been limited, and the model was trained to learn from a small number of samples. However, this does not provide information on the preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and I do not want to make any assumptions or provide incorrect information.
