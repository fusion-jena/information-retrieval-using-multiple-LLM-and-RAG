The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the calculation of performance metrics for each species and for two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites: a train set and a test set.

According to the context, the performance metrics are calculated for each species and then averaged over the 50 species. The metrics mentioned include Mean Loss, but the context does not provide information on other metrics such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.

It is mentioned that predictions are made for every species of E50, and the performance metrics are calculated for each species and for the train and test sets. However, the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that performance metrics such as Mean Loss are calculated, but I do not have information on other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.
