The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires to determine the optimal number of trees in the Random Forest (RF) model. This suggests that some form of validation was performed to evaluate the performance of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a diverse dataset, as evidenced by the various wildfire events from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) used to acquire training samples and validate the FIREMAP burned area (BA) product. The dataset includes wildfires from different locations and dates, which may help to improve the generalizability of the model.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting specifically. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

It is also worth noting that the context appears to focus on the use of Random Forest (RF) models, rather than deep learning models. While some of the same principles may apply, the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability may differ between these two types of models.
