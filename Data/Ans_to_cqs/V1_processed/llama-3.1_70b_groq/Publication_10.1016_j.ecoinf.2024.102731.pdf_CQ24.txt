I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or strategies for handling random seed values. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, ecology, and urban planning, with references to research papers on topics such as habitat suitability models, wild rabbit conservation, and urbanism. There is no information provided that would allow me to answer the query about deep learning and randomness.
