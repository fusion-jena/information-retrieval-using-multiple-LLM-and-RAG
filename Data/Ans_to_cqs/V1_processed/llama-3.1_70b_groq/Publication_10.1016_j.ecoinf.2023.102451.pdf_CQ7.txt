Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the performance of various deep learning models, including the proposed EMViT-Net, on the EMDS-6 dataset, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it is mentioned that the performance of the models is evaluated on the validation set and test set of the EMDS-6 dataset, suggesting that the data was split into at least three parts: training, validation, and testing. The specific criteria used for this split, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set or the method used to split the data (e.g., random, stratified), are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
