According to the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This involves marking the bounding boxes around the objects of interest, such as fish, in the images.
2. Instance segmentation: This involves creating masks that precisely align with the segmented contours of the objects, such as fish, in the images.

These annotation techniques are used to prepare the dataset for training the deep learning model. The annotated dataset is then used to train the model, which enables it to detect and recognize the objects of interest in the images.

Specifically, the context mentions that the researchers used the Roboflow integrated visualization to classify both the bounding boxes and masks, in order to maintain uniformity and coherence in the annotations. This suggests that the researchers used a combination of bounding box annotation and instance segmentation to annotate the dataset.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide detailed information on the specific tools or techniques used for data annotation, but it mentions the use of bounding box annotation and instance segmentation as part of the deep learning pipeline.
