Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the performance statistics of different models (statistical and machine learning) in predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps, feature selection, and the development of standard maps.

However, it does mention the evaluation criteria for machine learning models, which include the coefficient of determination (R2), NSE (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correlation coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024). Additionally, it mentions the calculation of performance statistics such as accuracy, sensitivity, kappa, and AUC for both training and testing datasets.

But, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
