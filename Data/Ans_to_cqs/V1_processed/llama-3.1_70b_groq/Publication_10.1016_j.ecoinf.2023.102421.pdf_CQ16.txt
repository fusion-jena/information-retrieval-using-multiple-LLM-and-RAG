The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process, and the mean RMSE was used as the objective function (lost function). This suggests that the training process was evaluated based on the model's performance on unseen data, but the specific stopping criteria are not mentioned.
