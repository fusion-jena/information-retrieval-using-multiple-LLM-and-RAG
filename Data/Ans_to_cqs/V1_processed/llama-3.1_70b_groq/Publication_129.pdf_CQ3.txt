Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the Faster R-CNN approach described, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation is likely used.

The Faster R-CNN approach involves a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that proposes object locations, and a regressor that adjusts these proposed locations to predict the bounding box area. This suggests that the data annotation technique used is likely bounding box annotation, where the annotator labels the object of interest with a bounding box.

There is no mention of instance segmentation in the provided context, which is a more complex annotation technique that involves labeling each pixel of the object of interest. Therefore, it is unclear if instance segmentation is used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation is likely used based on the Faster R-CNN approach described.
