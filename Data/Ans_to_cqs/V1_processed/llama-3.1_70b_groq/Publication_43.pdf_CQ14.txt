The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does mention that the user has to manually optimize and initialize a set of non-dimensional parameters in the segmentation step, specifically the scale parameter, the shape versus color parameter, and the compactness versus smoothness parameter. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized during the training process.
