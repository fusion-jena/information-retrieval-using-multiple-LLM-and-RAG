Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization, machine learning models, and techniques for improving model performance and interpretability.

However, it does mention random search as a default method for selecting optimal hyperparameters in many packages. But it does not delve into strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
