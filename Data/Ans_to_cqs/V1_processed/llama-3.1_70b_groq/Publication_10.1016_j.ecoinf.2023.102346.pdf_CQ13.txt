I don't know. The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT), but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in these models. Additionally, the context does not mention the use of deep learning models or their hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer.
