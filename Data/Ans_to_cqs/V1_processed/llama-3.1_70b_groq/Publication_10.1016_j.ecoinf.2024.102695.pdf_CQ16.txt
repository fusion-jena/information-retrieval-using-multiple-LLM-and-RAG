The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that an "early stopping strategy" is used, which implies that the training process is stopped before the last epoch if certain conditions are met. Unfortunately, the exact conditions for early stopping are not specified in the provided text.
