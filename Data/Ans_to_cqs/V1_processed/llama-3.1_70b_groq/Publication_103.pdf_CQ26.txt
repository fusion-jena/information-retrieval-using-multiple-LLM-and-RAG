The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does describe a method used to avoid biases in the experiments.

To avoid biases in the experiments, the datasets were separated in a special way for training and testing. For herbarium datasets H255 and H1K, data was separated so that sheets of the same species that were collected by the same collector were not permitted to enter both the training and testing sets. For the CR dataset, images of different leaves from each specimen were present in either the training or the testing set, but not in both. For the PlantCLEF (PC) dataset, this was done at the observation level, ensuring that no same observation was present in both training and testing subsets.

This approach can be seen as a form of data separation or stratification, but it is not explicitly stated as such. The goal of this method is to create more realistic and unbiased training/testing scenarios, although it may lead to lower accuracy rates.

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques to address data bias in the provided context.
