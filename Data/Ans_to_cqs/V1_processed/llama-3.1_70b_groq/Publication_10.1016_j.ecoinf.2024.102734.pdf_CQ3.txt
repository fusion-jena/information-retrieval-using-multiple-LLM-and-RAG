Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on audio classification and semi-supervised learning techniques, with mentions of active learning, transductive propagation, and contrastive learning.

However, it does mention that the dataset was annotated by a human, with 500 segments manually reviewed by a human annotator. Additionally, the paper "How to Annotate 100 Hours in 45 Minutes" by Fallgren et al. is referenced, which suggests that there may be some annotation technique or tool used to facilitate efficient annotation, but the specific technique is not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
