Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. The text mentions "high-resolution imagery" and "remotely sensed data" which suggests that the models are trained on image data. Additionally, the context mentions convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are commonly used for image classification and segmentation tasks.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not mentioned either, but it is possible that they might be used for storing metadata or other non-image data related to the images.

It's worth noting that the context is focused on using deep learning models for tasks such as image segmentation and classification, particularly in the context of remote sensing and environmental monitoring. Therefore, it is likely that image data formats are the primary focus of the pipeline.
