Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the feature extraction and classification workflows, specifically using ResNet-50 CNN and SVM classifier, but does not provide information on the data collection process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
