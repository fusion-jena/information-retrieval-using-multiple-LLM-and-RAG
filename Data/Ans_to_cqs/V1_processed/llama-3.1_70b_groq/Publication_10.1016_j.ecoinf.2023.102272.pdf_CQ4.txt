Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the performance of different deep learning models, such as DeepConvLSTM and CNN, and their validation accuracies, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
