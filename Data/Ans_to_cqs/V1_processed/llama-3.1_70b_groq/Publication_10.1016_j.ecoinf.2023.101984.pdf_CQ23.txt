The text does not mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather a MaxEnt model. To ensure the generalizability of the MaxEnt model, the following measures were taken:

* The model was run with the subsample run type and a 30% random test percentage, which suggests that the model was evaluated on a subset of the data that was not used for training.
* The model was run with maximum iterations, which suggests that the model was trained until convergence.
* The model's output was analyzed using permutation importance, which involves randomly permuting the values of each variable and measuring the resulting drop in model performance. This helps to evaluate the importance of each variable in the model.
* The model was run with 10 replicate runs, which suggests that the results were averaged across multiple runs to reduce the impact of random chance.

It is not clear from the text whether the dataset was diverse or whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. However, the use of permutation importance and replicate runs suggests that the authors took steps to evaluate the model's performance and generalizability.
