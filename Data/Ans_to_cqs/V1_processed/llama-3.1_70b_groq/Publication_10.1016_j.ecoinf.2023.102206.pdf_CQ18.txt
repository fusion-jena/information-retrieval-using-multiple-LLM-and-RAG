Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) approach, its application to GDP prediction using CO2 emission data, and its comparison with other methods such as FTL, GRNN, and SVR. It discusses the effectiveness of IFTL in restricting overconfidence and improving learning, but it does not provide information on the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.
