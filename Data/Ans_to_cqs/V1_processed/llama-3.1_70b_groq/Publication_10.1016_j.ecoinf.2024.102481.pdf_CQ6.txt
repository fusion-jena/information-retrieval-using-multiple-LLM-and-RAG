Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text appears to be a research article discussing the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forests, to predict reproductive condition in fish. It does not delve into the details of preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
