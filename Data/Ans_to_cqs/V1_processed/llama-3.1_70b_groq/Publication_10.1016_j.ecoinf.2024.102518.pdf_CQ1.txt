Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecology, and environmental variables, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for data collection.

However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that the authors may have used occurrence data and environmental variables, which could be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. For example, the reference by Boyce et al. (2002) mentions evaluating resource selection functions, which may involve collecting data on species occurrences and environmental variables.

Additionally, the reference by Boria et al. (2014) mentions spatial filtering to reduce sampling bias, which suggests that the authors may have used spatial data collection methods such as remote sensing or GIS.

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact answer to this question based on the provided context.
