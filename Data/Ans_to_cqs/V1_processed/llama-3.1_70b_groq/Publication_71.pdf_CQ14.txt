Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only provides the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ (Table 1) and mentions that the model was trained sequentially on four quadrants of the Vasiliko dataset with a specific patch size and learning rate. However, it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were chosen or optimized.

It can be inferred that the hyperparameters might have been chosen based on prior knowledge or existing research, as the context mentions that the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ are provided in Table 1. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine whether grid search, random search, or any other optimization method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
