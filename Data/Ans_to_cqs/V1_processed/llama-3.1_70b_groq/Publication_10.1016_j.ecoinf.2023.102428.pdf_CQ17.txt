Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the description of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and its application to Land Use Land Cover (LULC) simulation, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used.

The context does mention the use of a momentum factor and a sigmoid constant in the MLP model, but these are not regularization methods. The momentum factor is a hyperparameter that helps the model escape local minima during training, and the sigmoid constant is a parameter of the sigmoid activation function.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to the query regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
