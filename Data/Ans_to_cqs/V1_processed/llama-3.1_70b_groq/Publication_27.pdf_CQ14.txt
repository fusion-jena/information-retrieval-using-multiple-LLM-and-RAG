Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text appears to be a snippet from a research paper or academic document, but it does not provide clear information on the hyperparameter optimization method used.

The context includes various mathematical and technical terms, but it does not mention specific hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or other methods. Without more information or context, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
