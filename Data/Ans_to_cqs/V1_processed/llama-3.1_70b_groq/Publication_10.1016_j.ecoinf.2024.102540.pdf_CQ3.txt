The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a "polygon tool in the labeling section of the cloud-based Roboflow environment" (Dwyer and Nelson, 2022) to annotate images of alates on sorghum leaves. This suggests that instance segmentation, which involves annotating specific objects or instances in an image using polygons or masks, may be one of the data annotation techniques used. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the YOLOv5 model family, which is a type of object detection model that typically uses bounding box annotations. However, it is not explicitly stated that bounding box annotation is used in this specific pipeline. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that instance segmentation using polygon annotations may be one of the data annotation techniques used, but the use of bounding box annotation is not explicitly confirmed.
