The deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes two data formats: audio and image. 

For audio data, it is typically recorded as 16-bit stereo audio at a moderate sample rate of 22,000 samples per second (22 kHz). This data is often used to classify the presence or absence and activity rates of different endangered species, or to detect the sounds of birds colliding with energy infrastructure.

For image data, it is typically in the form of 2048-by-1536 8-bit 4:2:2 color images. These images are taken at least once every thirty seconds at each site and are used to track populations of invasive species, among other applications.

There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
