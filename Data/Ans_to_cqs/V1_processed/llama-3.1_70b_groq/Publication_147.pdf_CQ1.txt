The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for wetland mapping in Alberta, Canada, are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing data is used, as the text mentions the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, which are satellite-based Earth observation missions. Additionally, the text mentions the use of Google Earth Engine, which is a cloud-based platform for Earth observation data and analysis.

It is also mentioned that the study area includes the Boreal Natural Region of Alberta, Canada, and that the data sets used include those generated from photo interpretation and field validation. However, the specific methods used for collecting these data sets are not provided.

It is worth noting that the context mentions the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which is a type of remote sensing data that can be used for land cover classification. However, the specific methods used for collecting this data are not provided.

Overall, while the context provides some information on the types of data used in the deep learning pipeline, it does not provide detailed information on the methods used for collecting these data.
