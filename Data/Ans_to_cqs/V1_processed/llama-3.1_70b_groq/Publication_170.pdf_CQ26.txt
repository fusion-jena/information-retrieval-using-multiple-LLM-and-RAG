Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning for image classification, specifically for camera trap images, and the performance of the model on different training sets and computing platforms.

However, it does mention the use of a large dataset (29,192 images) and the extension of the training set with newly labeled images, which could potentially help to reduce data bias. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a deep learning model (AlexNet) and its performance on different training sets, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The techniques mentioned in the query, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection, are common techniques used to address data bias, but I do not know if they were used in this specific study.
