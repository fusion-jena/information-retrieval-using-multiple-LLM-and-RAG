Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The text primarily discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their architectures, and their performance on small datasets. It also mentions the use of XGBoost for Fv/Fm parameter estimation, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

However, it does mention that deep learning models generally require substantial datasets to achieve optimal results, which suggests that a diverse dataset might be necessary for training a deep learning model. But it does not provide any specific information on cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
