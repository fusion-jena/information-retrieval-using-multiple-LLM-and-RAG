Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the development of a lightweight deep learning model (SIAlex) and its application to bird sound classification, as well as referencing various other studies related to image and audio classification.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Common techniques used to address data bias include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation of underrepresented groups.

These techniques can help to mitigate data bias and improve the performance of deep learning models. However, the specific techniques used in the context of the SIAlex model are not mentioned in the provided text.
