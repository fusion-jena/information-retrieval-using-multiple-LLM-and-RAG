Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and a glossary related to coral reefs, fish, and benthic communities, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

However, one paper by Villon et al. (2021) mentions "few-shot learning" for automatic underwater fish species classification with limited data. Few-shot learning is a machine learning approach that involves training a model on a small number of examples, but it is not a data annotation technique per se.

Another paper by Do and Tran (2023) mentions combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of spotted butterfish, but it does not provide details on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
