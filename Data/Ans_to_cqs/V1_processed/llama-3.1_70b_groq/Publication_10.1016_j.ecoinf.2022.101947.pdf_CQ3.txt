Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Amur tigers, where footprint images were collected and analyzed to determine the optimal size for algorithm training and test sets. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used.

The context does mention the extraction of variables from footprint images, such as lengths, angles, and areas, but it does not specify how these variables were annotated or labeled. It also mentions the use of landmark points and geometric relationships to generate additional variables, but again, it does not provide information on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
