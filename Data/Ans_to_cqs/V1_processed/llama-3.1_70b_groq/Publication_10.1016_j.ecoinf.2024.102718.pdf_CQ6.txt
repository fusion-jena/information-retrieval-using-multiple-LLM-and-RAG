According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. To Tensor: This step is mentioned as part of the preprocessing pipeline, but the exact details are not provided.
2. Normalize: The context mentions that the images are normalized with a mean of [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and a standard deviation of [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].
3. Data augmentation: The context mentions that the dataset is augmented, which increases the number of images to 185,431 with 38 classes.
4. Addition of noise: The context mentions that Gaussian Noise and Speckle Noise are added to the images.
5. Image resizing: The context mentions that the images are resized to a size of (224, 224).
6. Random adjustments: The context mentions that random adjustments are made to the images, including:
* Rotation: up to 30 degrees
* Brightness: adjusted by a factor of 0.4
* Contrast: adjusted by a factor of 0.4
* Saturation: adjusted by a factor of 0.4
* Hue: adjusted by a factor of 0.1

These preprocessing steps are likely used to prepare the data for training a deep learning model, but the exact details of the preprocessing pipeline are not fully provided in the context.
