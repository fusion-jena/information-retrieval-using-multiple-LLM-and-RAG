The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. According to Table 1, sensitivity and specificity are used to evaluate the performance of the model for each species. The model's overall performance is also evaluated using accuracy, with the model achieving an accuracy of 0.83 for the train split and 0.74 for the test split. However, precision and recall are not mentioned in the provided context as evaluation metrics.
