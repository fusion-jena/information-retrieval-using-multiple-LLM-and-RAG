Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the use of deep CNN networks for plant species identification, the importance of large datasets, and the analysis of feature visualizations. It also mentions the performance of various classifiers and features but does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used during training.

However, it does mention the use of different classifiers such as MLP, SVM (linear and RBF), and NN, but it does not provide information on the optimization algorithms used for training the deep CNN models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
