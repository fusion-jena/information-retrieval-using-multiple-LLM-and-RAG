Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on downscaling climate data and evaluating the performance of different algorithms (RFs, GBMs, ANNs) in this context.

However, it does mention that the authors anticipated difficulties with downscaling macroclimate grids, which may imply that they were aware of potential biases in the data. Additionally, the context mentions that the authors used cross-validation to evaluate the performance of their models, which can help to identify and mitigate overfitting and other biases.

But, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
