I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, geographic information systems, and machine learning, specifically random forests, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
