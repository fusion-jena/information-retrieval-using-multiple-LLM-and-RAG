Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few instances where data is utilized, such as:

* CO2 emission data of developed countries
* Acoustic data for identifying oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows
* EEG signals for driver drowsiness estimation
* Texture image segmentation
* Housing dataset, synthetic dataset, etc.

It can be inferred that the data collection methods might include:

* Utilizing existing public datasets (e.g., housing dataset)
* Collecting data from sensors (e.g., EEG signals, acoustic data)
* Possibly using synthetic data generation methods (e.g., synthetic dataset)

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. The context does not mention surveys as a method for collecting raw data.
