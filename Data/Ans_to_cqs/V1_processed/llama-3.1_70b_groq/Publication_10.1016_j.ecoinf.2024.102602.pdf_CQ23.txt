To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was divided into 5 subsets, and 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the models. This approach provides a robust and unbiased estimate of a model's performance while also guiding effective hyper-parameter tuning for improved overall performance.

Additionally, the dataset was split into training (90% of the images) and validation sets (10% of the images) at each iteration of the 5-fold cross-validation. This splitting helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data.

The use of 5-fold cross-validation also helps to reduce the effect of any bias in the dataset, as the model is trained and evaluated on different subsets of the data. This approach helps to ensure that the model is generalizable to new, unseen data.

It is not explicitly mentioned whether the dataset is diverse or if stratified splitting was used. However, the use of 5-fold cross-validation and the splitting of the dataset into training and validation sets helps to ensure the generalizability of the model.
