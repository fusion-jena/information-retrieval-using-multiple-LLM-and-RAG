Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the authors used the default settings for YOLOv6 after trying different sets of hyperparameters and not finding significant improvements. It does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used.
