The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image data. The text mentions "a batch of input images" and "image labeling", indicating that images are a key component of the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions "underwater fish video processing techniques", suggesting that video data may also be involved. However, it is unclear if the video data is processed as individual frames (i.e., images) or if the pipeline uses video-specific formats. There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats in the provided context.
