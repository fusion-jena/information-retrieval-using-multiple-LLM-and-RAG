Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically CNN architectures, for predicting water quality and algal blooms, as well as reviewing various research papers on related topics.

However, I can provide some general information on common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of instances of the minority class to balance the data.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the data.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the problem being addressed.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide specific information on how data bias is addressed in the deep learning pipeline for the specific application of predicting water quality and algal blooms.
