Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the AutoML procedure, neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, CNN), and their performance in case studies. It also provides some background information on deep learning and its applications in ecology.

The context does mention the use of a small subset of data (data partition At) for training candidate models and a left-out validation data set (Av) for comparing their performance. However, it does not provide details on how the data was annotated or prepared for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
