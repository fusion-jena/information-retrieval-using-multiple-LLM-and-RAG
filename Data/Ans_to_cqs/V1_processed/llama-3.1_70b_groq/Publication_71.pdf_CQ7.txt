Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ and discusses the challenges of incorporating a NIR band in addition to RGB bands in the model. It also mentions the need for significant GPU power and larger batch sizes for efficient model training.

However, it does mention the importance of having a lot of training data that includes the NIR band in addition to RGB color images. This suggests that the data split criteria might involve ensuring that the training, test, and validation sets are representative of the different scenarios and characteristics present in the data.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer to the query.
