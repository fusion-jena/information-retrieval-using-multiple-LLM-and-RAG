Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on a specific machine learning approach called MTMI-SMF and its comparison to random forest classification. It discusses the advantages of MTMI-SMF, such as its ability to handle imperfect data and its computational efficiency, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention that MTMI-SMF can work with imperfect data, which suggests that it may be robust to certain types of noise or errors in the data. Additionally, the context mentions that MTMI-SMF groups pixels surrounding a training location, which could be considered a form of data preprocessing. However, this is not a traditional preprocessing step like normalization or scaling.

In general, preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important for many machine learning models, including deep learning models. These steps can help improve the performance and stability of the model by reducing the effects of noise and outliers in the data. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine what preprocessing steps are involved in the context provided.
