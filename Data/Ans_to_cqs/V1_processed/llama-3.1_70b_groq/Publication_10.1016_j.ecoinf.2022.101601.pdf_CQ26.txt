Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to permafrost models, thaw depth, and ecological informatics, but it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or data preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
