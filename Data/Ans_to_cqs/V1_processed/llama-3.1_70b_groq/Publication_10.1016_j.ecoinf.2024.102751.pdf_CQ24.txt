Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on soil science, ecology, and remote sensing, with some references to statistical learning and machine learning. However, it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or randomness handling.

That being said, the context does mention the potential use of machine learning or deep neural networks for estimating soil moisture, but it does not provide further details on how randomness would be handled in such models.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
