Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that there are benchmark datasets publicly available for training and testing of deep learning approaches in the fields of remote sensing, specifically for land use land cover (LULC) classification, urban feature extraction, and crop detection.

It also mentions that a selection of 1 km2 was manually labeled for training in the study by Flood et al. [35], and that 5664 tree samples were used for CNN training in another study. Additionally, 931 test tree samples were used for tree species classification accuracy assessment.

Therefore, while the context does not mention specific well-known datasets like MNIST or CIFAR, it does mention that various datasets are used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications.
