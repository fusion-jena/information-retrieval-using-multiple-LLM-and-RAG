Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks was used to create a high-resolution CHM of the Earth, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
