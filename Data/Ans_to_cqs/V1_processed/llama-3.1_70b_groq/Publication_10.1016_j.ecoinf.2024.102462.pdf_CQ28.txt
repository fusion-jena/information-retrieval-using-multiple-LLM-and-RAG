I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the importance of high-quality annotated data for training deep learning models, the challenges of identifying sub-alpine shrub species, and the use of fieldwork expeditions to validate orthomosaic annotations. It also mentions the potential of combining unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning (DL) to increase understanding of environmental changes. However, it does not provide information on the deployment platform used for the deep learning model.
