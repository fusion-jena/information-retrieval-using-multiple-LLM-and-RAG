Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses various research papers and studies related to image processing, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and underwater image analysis, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing images. This can help improve the robustness and generalization of the model. Some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering, among others.

If you are looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I would recommend referring to a more comprehensive resource or a specific research paper that focuses on data augmentation in deep learning.
