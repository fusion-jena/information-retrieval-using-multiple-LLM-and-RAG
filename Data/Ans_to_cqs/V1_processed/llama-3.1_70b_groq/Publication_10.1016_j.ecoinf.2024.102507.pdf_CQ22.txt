The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, F1-score, and recall. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the VGG19 and ResNet50 models in various experiments, as shown in Tables 11 and 12. Specifically, the tables report the accuracy, precision, F1-score, and recall of the models on different datasets and data formats. For example, in Table 11, the accuracy, precision, F1-score, and recall of the VGG19 model on the 36band_256_8bit dataset are 0.93, 0.74, 0.32, and 0.99, respectively. Similarly, in Table 12, the accuracy, precision, F1-score, and recall of the ResNet50 model on the 72band_256_16bit dataset are 0.94, 0.73, 0.28, and 0.99, respectively. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance on different datasets and data formats.
