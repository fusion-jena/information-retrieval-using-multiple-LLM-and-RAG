The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions the use of CNNs for plant species identification and the analysis of feature visualisation of different layers in the CNN. The text also references specific CNN architectures, such as AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet, which further supports the conclusion that CNNs are the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
