Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be discussing the NASA Web Service API Provider class and its methods, as well as the deployment of a Python 3.9 environment on a virtual machine. There is no information about model serialization, platform selection, or any other aspect of deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
