The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to compare the performance of CityBioNet and bulbul, such as True Positives, False Negatives, and True Negatives.

It is mentioned that CityBioNet correctly predicted the presence of biotic sound (True Positives) in a greater proportion of audio data than bulbul, and also correctly predicted the absence of biotic sound (True Negatives) in a similar proportion of audio data as bulbul. Additionally, the context mentions that CityBioNet failed to correctly predict the presence of biotic sound (False Negatives) in a lower proportion of recordings than bulbul.

There is no mention of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query based on the available information.
