Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that some of the methods used for collecting data might include:

* Sensors: Some of the references mention the use of sensors in collecting data, such as in the context of water resources applications (Bowden et al., 2002) and ecological modeling (Everaert et al., 2013).
* Public datasets: Some of the references mention the use of public datasets, such as in the context of short-term wind forecasting (Feng et al., 2017) and streamflow forecasting (Dehghani et al., 2023).
* Other sources: Some of the references mention the use of other sources of data, such as rainfall-runoff models (Chadalawada et al., 2017) and signal classification (Varanis et al., 2015).

However, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context, as it does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is incomplete, and it is recommended to consult additional sources to get a more comprehensive understanding of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
