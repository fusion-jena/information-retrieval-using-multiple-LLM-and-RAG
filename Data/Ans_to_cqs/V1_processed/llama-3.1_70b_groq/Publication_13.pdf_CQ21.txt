The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps. However, it does mention the calculation of metrics and the use of a confusion matrix.

According to the context, a classification error was visualized as a scaled confusion matrix. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which is a common postprocessing step in machine learning.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of metrics such as accuracy and loss during training. It also reports the results of statistical tests (e.g., p-values) to compare the performance of different models.

However, there is no mention of Saliency maps or other postprocessing steps such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, or SHAP values. Therefore, it is unclear whether these steps were performed or not.
