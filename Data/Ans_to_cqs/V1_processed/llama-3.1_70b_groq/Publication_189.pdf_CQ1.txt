The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include:

1. Scraping from the web: This involves collecting data from publicly available sources on the internet.
2. Downloading from other sources: This involves collecting data from other sources, such as public datasets or repositories.
3. Buying datasets from re-sellers: This involves purchasing datasets from third-party vendors.
4. Creating a dataset from scratch: This involves collecting data from scratch, using methods such as using a fixed camera to take images at regular intervals.

In the specific case mentioned in the context, a KaKaXi fixed camera was used to collect images every hour within a fixed period of time each day. These images were then saved in a database.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention surveys as a method for collecting raw data, despite being mentioned in the query. However, the context does mention a survey in the context of a research paper on detection, but it is not related to data collection.
