Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of artificial neural networks (ANN) and various atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms for remote sensing and aquatic environment analysis.

However, it does mention the use of deep convolutional neural networks and deep neural networks for land use/land cover classification, as mentioned in the paper by Kumar and Gorai (2023). But it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in these networks.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
