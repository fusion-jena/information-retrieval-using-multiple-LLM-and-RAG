The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the references and the text, it appears that the deep learning model is used for classification tasks, specifically for mapping and classification of land cover types, such as built-up areas, grasslands, and wetlands. For example, the paper by Wu et al. (2021a) mentions using a deep learning framework for built-up area mapping in China from GF-3 SAR imagery. Similarly, the paper by Xing et al. (2023) discusses a coastal wetlands mapping approach using a hierarchical classification and optimal feature selection framework. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
