Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of the XGBoost model, the SHAP method for interpretation, and the LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
