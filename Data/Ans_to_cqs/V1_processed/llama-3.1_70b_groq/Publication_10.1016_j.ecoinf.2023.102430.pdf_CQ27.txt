Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training and testing of the algorithms, including the implementation of the Artificial Neural Network (AN) in MATLAB and the use of scikit-learn toolbox in Python for the classical machine-learning algorithms. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.
