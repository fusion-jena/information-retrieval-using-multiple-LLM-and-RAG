I don't know. The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only mentions a study by Lassalle et al. (2022) that used deep learning-based individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very-high-resolution satellite imagery, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the model.
