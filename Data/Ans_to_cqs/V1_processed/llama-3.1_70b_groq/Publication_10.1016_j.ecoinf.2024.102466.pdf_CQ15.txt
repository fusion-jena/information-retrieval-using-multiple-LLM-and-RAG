Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different object detection models (e.g., Cascade RCNN, Faster RCNN, ATSS) on camera trap images for bird recognition, discussing their mAP scores, and training epochs. It does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
