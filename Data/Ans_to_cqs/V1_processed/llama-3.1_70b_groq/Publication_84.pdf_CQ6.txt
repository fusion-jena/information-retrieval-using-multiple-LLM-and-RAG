Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the application of phenological knowledge to improve the performance of deep learning methods, particularly in the detection of invasive species using Landsat images. However, it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that were used in the study.
