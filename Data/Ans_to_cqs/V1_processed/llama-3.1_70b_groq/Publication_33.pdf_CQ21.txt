The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does describe a post-processing framework that involves setting a confidence threshold for each class to transform the classification results into three types: correct, misclassified, and unsure.

The context mentions that the goal of this post-processing framework is to transform as many misclassifications as possible into "Unsure" while preventing too many correct classifications from being transformed into "Unsure". This is achieved by tuning a risk threshold τi specific to each class (i.e., each species) using an independent database T1.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's output is processed to obtain the class with the highest classification score S(X) and the corresponding confidence score. However, it does not provide further details on the specific post-processing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the post-processing steps involved after the model training include:

* Setting a confidence threshold for each class
* Transforming classification results into three types: correct, misclassified, and unsure
* Tuning a risk threshold τi specific to each class using an independent database T1

However, the context does not provide information on Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, so it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer.
