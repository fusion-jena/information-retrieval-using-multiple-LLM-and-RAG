The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, is classification. The model is used to recognize and classify different bird species based on their calls. The model is trained on a dataset of audio recordings of bird calls and is designed to learn features from the input data that can be used to distinguish between different species. The model's performance is evaluated on its ability to correctly classify the species of bird from a given audio recording.
