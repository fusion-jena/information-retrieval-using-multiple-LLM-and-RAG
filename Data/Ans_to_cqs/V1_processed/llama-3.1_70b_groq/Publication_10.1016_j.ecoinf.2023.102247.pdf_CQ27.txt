I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of study species, and the evaluation of model performance using cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC). However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
