The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of cross-validation resampling, specifically fivefold cross-validation. This involves splitting the dataset into five equal-sized folds and validating the training and assessment process five times, with one fold used for testing each time. Additionally, the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE), which are averaged across the five iterations to improve model performance and hyperparameter tuning efficiency.
