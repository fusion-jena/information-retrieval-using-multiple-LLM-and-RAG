Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the development and application of a novel deep learning method for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. However, it does not provide information on where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
