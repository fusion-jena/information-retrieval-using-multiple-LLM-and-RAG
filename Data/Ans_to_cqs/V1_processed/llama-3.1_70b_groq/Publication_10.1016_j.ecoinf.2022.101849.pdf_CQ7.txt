Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning tasks, specifically in the context of regression and predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. It discusses various definitions and terms used to describe variants of noise and scarceness of labels, as well as a new computational setting for regression with structurally incomplete target labels.

However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
