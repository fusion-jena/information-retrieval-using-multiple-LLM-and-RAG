I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be a list of academic papers related to remote sensing, ecology, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about the deployment of a specific model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
