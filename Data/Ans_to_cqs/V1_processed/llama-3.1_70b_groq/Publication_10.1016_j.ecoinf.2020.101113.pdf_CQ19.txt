None of the provided context mentions the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a pre-trained ResNet50 model, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, but it does not specify the framework used to implement it. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
