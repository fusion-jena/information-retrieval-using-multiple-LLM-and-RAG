Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The text primarily focuses on the AutoML procedure, model architectures, and handling class imbalance in the data. It does mention that candidate models are generated with architectures and hyperparameters selected at random from a prespecified range of values, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled or controlled in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values, based on the provided context.
