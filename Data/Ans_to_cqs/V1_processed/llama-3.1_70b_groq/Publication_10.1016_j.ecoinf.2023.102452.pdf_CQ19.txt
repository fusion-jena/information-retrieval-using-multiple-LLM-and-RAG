Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be focused on various research papers and studies related to forecasting, signal processing, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used for building deep learning models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
