I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that deep learning algorithms are used in strategic planning (Report 1998) and that researchers have used deep learning models in various studies (Ren et al., 2021; Wu, 2022), but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models.
