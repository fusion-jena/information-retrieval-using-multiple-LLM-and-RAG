The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the deep learning model is being used for species distribution modeling, which involves predicting the presence or absence of a species at a given location based on environmental data.

The context mentions that the model is being used to assign labels to unlabeled data points, which suggests that the model is being used for classification tasks. Specifically, the model is being used to classify locations as either present (1) or absent (0) for a target species.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model is being used to predict species distributions, which involves modeling the relationship between environmental variables and species presence/absence. This suggests that the model is being used for regression or classification tasks, rather than segmentation or detection tasks.

Overall, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated, it appears to be related to classification tasks for species distribution modeling.
