Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the model components, prior distributions, and evaluation metrics (RMSE and CV), but it does not provide information on the optimization method used for hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
