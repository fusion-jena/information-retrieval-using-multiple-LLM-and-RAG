Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning in ecology, the use of machine learning models to understand relationships between species-specific productivity and environmental conditions, and the importance of anticipating the potential effects of climate change on fungal productivity.

However, I can provide some general information on common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models. Typically, preprocessing steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model performance
* Feature engineering: creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data

Please note that the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture. If you're looking for specific guidance on preprocessing steps for a particular deep learning model, I recommend consulting the relevant literature or documentation for that model.
