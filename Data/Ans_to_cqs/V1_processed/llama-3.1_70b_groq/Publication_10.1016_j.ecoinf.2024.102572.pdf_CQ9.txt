Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions that data is stored on Google Drive in CSV format, but it does not provide information about a public data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It does mention a link to a dataset on the CEDA catalogue (https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084), but it is not clear if this is the same dataset or pipeline being referred to.
