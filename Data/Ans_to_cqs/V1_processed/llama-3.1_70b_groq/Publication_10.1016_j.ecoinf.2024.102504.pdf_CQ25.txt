The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the provided context is primarily for prediction and forecasting tasks, specifically in the field of air quality and environmental monitoring.

For instance, the study by Navares and Aznarte (2020) employed a deep learning LSTM model to predict air quality, indicating that the model is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to forecast continuous values of air quality parameters.

Similarly, the study by Gokul et al. (2023) used an LSTM deep learning model to predict PM2.5 levels in Hyderabad city, which also suggests a regression task.

In contrast, the study by A. Nakhjiri and A.A. Kakroodi (no specific date mentioned) used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for supervised classification of land cover classes in Tehran Province, which is a classification task.

However, it is essential to note that the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models for segmentation or detection tasks. Therefore, based on the available information, the primary purpose of the deep learning models mentioned is for prediction and forecasting tasks, specifically in the field of air quality and environmental monitoring.
