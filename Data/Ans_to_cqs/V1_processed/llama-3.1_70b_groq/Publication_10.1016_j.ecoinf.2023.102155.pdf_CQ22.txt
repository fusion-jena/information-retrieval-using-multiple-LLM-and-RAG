The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of various methods (e.g., LoopT, knn, kmeans, random, CoinF, LoopA, LoopE) for classification and intensity prediction tasks. The performance of these methods is evaluated using the meanRSS (mean Residual Sum of Squares) metric. Additionally, the context mentions the use of NIMSE (Normalized Mean Squared Error) as a performance measure, but it is not clear if this is used to evaluate the same tasks as the meanRSS. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall as performance metrics.
