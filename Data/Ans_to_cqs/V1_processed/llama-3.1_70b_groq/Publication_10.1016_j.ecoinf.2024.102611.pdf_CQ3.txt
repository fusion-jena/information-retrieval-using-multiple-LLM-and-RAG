Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various studies and research papers related to plant species classification, medicinal plant identification, and leaf-based plant species classification using deep learning models.

However, it can be inferred that the studies mentioned in the context might have used some form of data annotation, as they involve image classification tasks. But the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned.

Some studies, like Barhate et al. (2023), mention the use of dimensionality reduction with ESPCA, which might involve some form of data preprocessing or annotation. However, the specific annotation techniques used are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
