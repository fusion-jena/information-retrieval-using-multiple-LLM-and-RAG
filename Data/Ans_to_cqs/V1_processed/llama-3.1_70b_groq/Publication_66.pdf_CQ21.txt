The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models. 

The context mentions the calculation of specificity, sensitivity, PPV (Positive Predictive Value), and NPV (Negative Predictive Value) for the models. It also mentions the use of confusion matrices, as it refers to correctly predicted dives and non-dives, incorrectly predicted dives and non-dives, and other related metrics.

Specifically, the context mentions the following metrics:

- Correctly predicted dives (e)
- Correctly predicted non-dives (f)
- Incorrectly predicted dives (g)
- Incorrectly predicted non-dives (h)

These metrics are typically used to construct a confusion matrix, which is a common postprocessing step in machine learning model evaluation. However, the context does not mention the use of saliency maps or other postprocessing techniques.
