Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to various research papers and articles on topics such as soil heat flux estimation, wastewater treatment plant influent, and remote sensing. However, it does not provide information on the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention some specific papers and articles, but none of them seem to be related to the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. For example, the paper by Zhang et al. (2023) discusses a deep learning-based data-driven model for detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent, but it does not mention the specific datasets used.

Similarly, the paper by Maxwell et al. (2018) discusses the implementation of machine-learning classification in remote sensing, but it does not provide information on the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
