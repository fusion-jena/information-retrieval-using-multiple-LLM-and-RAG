I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The text primarily focuses on the application of deep learning-based image analysis for characterizing soil bacterial communities, the use of microfluidic soil chips, and the benefits of this approach. It does not delve into the technical details of the deep learning pipeline or how randomness is handled. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
