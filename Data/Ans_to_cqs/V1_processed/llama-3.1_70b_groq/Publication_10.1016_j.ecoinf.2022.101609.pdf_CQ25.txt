The purpose of the deep learning model is to make day-ahead predictions of three pollutants, specifically PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration levels. This is a regression problem, as the model is trained to predict continuous values of pollutant concentrations. The model is designed to learn from structured data with additional features, allowing it to explore entity embeddings for categorical features. The ultimate goal of the model is to provide a substitute for estimating air quality on highways where air quality sensing devices are not available, but data on other features such as traffic flow and weather are captured.
