The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the different datasets used in the training process, such as the training dataset (Dtrain), attack dataset (DS), attack test dataset (T), target training set, target validation set, target test set, attack set, and evaluation set.

From the context, it can be inferred that the data is split into different sets based on their purpose in the training process. For example, the target training set is used to train the target model, while the target validation set is used to validate the hyper-parameters. The target test set is used to assess the classification accuracy of the target model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the attack test dataset (T) is disjoint from the attack dataset (DS) and the training dataset (Dtrain), and is composed of non-member individuals never seen before by DS and Dtrain. This suggests that the data is split in a way that ensures the attack test dataset is independent of the training data.

However, the exact criteria used to split the data, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set, is not specified in the provided context.
