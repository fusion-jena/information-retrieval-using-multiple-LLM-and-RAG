To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the context mentions the use of well-known benchmark datasets that are partitioned into test data (target domain) and training data (source domain) using techniques such as KFold or StratifiedKFold. However, it is noted that in the standard evaluation process, both the source and target domains are drawn from the same domain distribution, which may not be ideal for evaluating the performance of transfer learning algorithms like IFTL.

To address this limitation, the context suggests that the source and target domains should be highly diverse but related, meaning that the distribution of the source and target domains should not be the same (Ds ≠ Dt or Ts ≠ Tt or both). This is hypothesized to be a more realistic scenario for evaluating the performance of transfer learning algorithms.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of techniques such as data augmentation, as proposed by Sousa et al. (2020), to overcome data limitations. However, it does not provide further details on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in the context of the IFTL algorithm.
