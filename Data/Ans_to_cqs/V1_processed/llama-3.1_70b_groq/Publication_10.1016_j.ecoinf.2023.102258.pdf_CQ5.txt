Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few datasets related to bioacoustics, including QU and MGE, which contained very short sounds. Additionally, it mentions the use of audio examples from the query set and the support set in the context of few-shot learning. But it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
