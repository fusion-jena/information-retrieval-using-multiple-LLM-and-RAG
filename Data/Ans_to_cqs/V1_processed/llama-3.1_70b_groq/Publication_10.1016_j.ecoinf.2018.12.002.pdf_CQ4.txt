Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context appears to be focused on the analysis of animal movement data using various machine learning algorithms, including random forests and support vector machines, but it does not delve into the specifics of data augmentation techniques used in deep learning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
