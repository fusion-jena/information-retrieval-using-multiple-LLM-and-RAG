Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning models, particularly neural networks, in environmental science and the analysis of El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. It also discusses the use of techniques like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Random Forest (RF) models, but does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it does mention the optimization of hyperparameters for deep neural networks (DNNs) in the context of land cover/land use classification, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
