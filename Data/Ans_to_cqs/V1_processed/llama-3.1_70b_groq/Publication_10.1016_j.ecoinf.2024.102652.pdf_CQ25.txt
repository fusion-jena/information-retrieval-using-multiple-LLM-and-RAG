The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the MU-NET model, is semantic segmentation. This means that the model is designed to assign a category label to each pixel of an image, allowing it to detect and segment soil salinity and vegetation from satellite images. The model is trained to automatically monitor and manage soil salinity without the need for ongoing field measurements.
