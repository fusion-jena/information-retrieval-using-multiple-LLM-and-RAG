The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context, specifically SLSTM and SGRU, is time-series prediction. They are used to forecast future values based on past data, such as agricultural product sales or the Pacific decadal oscillation index. The models are designed to learn from complex data and make predictions about future trends or patterns. Additionally, the SVR model is used for regression tasks, aiming to simplify parameters and handle nonlinear problems.
