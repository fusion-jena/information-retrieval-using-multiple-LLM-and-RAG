Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text appears to be a research paper or a technical document discussing various aspects of deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks, attention mechanisms, and dynamic convolution. However, it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models.

Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the given context.
