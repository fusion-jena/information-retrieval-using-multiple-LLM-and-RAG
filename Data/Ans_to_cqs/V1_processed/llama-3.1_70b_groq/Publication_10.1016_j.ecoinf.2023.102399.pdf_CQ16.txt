Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on estimating body weight using a YOLO model, and it provides various metrics such as RMSE, MRE, and R2, but it does not discuss the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
