The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and recall. According to the provided context, specifically Figure 4, the plot depicts bounding box precision (the fraction of insect-containing bounding boxes among all bounding boxes returned by the algorithm) as a function of recall (the proportion of all insects that were identified by the algorithm). This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify insects (precision) and detect all instances of insects (recall).
