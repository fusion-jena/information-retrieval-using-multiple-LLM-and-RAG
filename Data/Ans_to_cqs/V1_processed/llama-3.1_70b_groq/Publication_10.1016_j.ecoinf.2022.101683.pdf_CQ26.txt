The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention methods to address sampling bias in Invasive Species Distribution Models (iSDM). 

According to the context, three methods are used to reduce sampling bias: 

1. Weighted background points: This method involves assigning weights to background points to reduce the impact of sampling bias.
2. Filtered (pre-thinned) records: This method involves spatial filtering of input data to reduce spatial autocorrelation bias. This can be done by reducing the spatial resolution of species records or by removing records from densely recorded clusters.
3. Targeted background points: This method involves selecting background points in a targeted manner to reduce sampling bias.

Additionally, the context mentions a technique called "OccurrenceThinner" which is used to thin species records based on their kernel density. This technique is used to filter out a greater proportion of sightings from areas with high record density.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection as techniques to address data bias. These techniques may be relevant in the context of deep learning pipelines, but they are not discussed in the provided context.
