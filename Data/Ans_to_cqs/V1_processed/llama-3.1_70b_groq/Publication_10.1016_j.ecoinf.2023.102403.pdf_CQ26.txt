The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some methods used to address biases in biodiversity data.

According to the context, the authors used a comprehensive series of filters to enhance the quality and reliability of the information. They also applied a thorough examination and refinement of the data repositories. Specifically, they:

* Filtered the dataset by columns labeled "scientific name", "family", "year", "longitude", and "latitude".
* Removed records with NA in these columns.
* Removed all duplicate records with identical latitude and longitude.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors considered different weighting schemes for records in areas with sufficient sampling to provide a more reliable contribution compared to underrepresented regions.

However, the context does not mention specific techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not know if these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this specific context.
