I don't know. The provided context does not mention a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. In fact, the context mentions using the BIOMOD2 package in R for ensemble modeling, but it does not mention deep learning. It also mentions using various data sources, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and habitat variables, but it does not provide information on where the data is stored or shared.
