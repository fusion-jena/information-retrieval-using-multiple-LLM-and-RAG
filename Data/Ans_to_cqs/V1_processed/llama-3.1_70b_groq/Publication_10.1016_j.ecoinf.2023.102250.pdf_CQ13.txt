Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the hyperparameter settings were kept the same as in the previous model when replacing the original 3 Ã— 3 static convolutional kernel with a dynamic convolutional kernel. It does not provide any information about the actual values of the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
