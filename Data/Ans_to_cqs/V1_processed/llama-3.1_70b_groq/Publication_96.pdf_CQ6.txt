The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the input of the training data was split into two parts, but it does not provide further details on the preprocessing steps.

It is mentioned that the spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas were collected for the entire study area, and that the Landsat spectral bands were chosen because of their sensitivity to fire events. Additionally, it is mentioned that the following Landsat-8 spectral bands were used for the classification model of burned areas: red (RED - 0.65 μm), near-infrared (NIR - 0.86 μm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR 1 - 1.6 μm and SWIR 2 - 2.2 μm). 

It is also mentioned that Landsat bands 2 to 7, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NBR, and delta NBR (Difference Normalizes Burned Index) were tested. However, it does not provide information on whether these bands were normalized or scaled before being used as input to the model.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
