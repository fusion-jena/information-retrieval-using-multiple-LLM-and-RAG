I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the DeepLabV3+ algorithm was developed using the PyTorch library and Python programming language, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
