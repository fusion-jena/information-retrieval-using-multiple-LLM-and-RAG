The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of background points in modeling approaches, which can be related to addressing data bias.

In the context of species distribution modeling, the text mentions the use of different numbers of background points (e.g., "1×", "10×", and "10 K") to train models. This can be seen as a form of oversampling or undersampling, where the number of background points is adjusted to balance the number of presence points.

However, the text does not explicitly mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as methods to address data bias. Additionally, it does not discuss diverse data collection as a technique to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only mention that adjusting the number of background points is a technique used in species distribution modeling, but I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
