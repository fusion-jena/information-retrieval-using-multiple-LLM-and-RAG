Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the importance of proper data splitting and validation procedures, as well as the use of the YOLOv5 model with "Slicing Aided Hyper Inference" (SAHI), but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
