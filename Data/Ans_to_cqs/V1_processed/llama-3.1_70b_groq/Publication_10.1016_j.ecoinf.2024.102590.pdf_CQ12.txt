CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

According to the provided context, the text mentions that "deep learning CNN (Jagannathan and Divya, 2021)" can be used as a methodology for future LULC analysis, and that it will be most effective and useful to map land cover or more specifically woody cover. This suggests that the authors are considering using a CNN model for future work, but it is not explicitly stated that a CNN model is used in the current pipeline. However, based on the mention of CNN in the context, it can be inferred that CNN is the type of deep learning model being referred to.
