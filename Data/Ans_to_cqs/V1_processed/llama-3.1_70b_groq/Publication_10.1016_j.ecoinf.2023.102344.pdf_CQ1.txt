Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of various deep learning models, such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, in image-based classification tasks. It also mentions the use of pre-trained networks and the integration of PCA-NCA in some approaches.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in the pipeline consists of images, specifically images of bivalves, as mentioned in the context. The context also mentions that the images were used as inputs to the pre-trained networks, but it does not provide information on how these images were collected.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
