Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context primarily discusses various techniques and methods related to transfer learning, domain adaptation, and fuzzy logic, but it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to implement these techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
