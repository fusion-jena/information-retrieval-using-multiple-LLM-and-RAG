I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the use of BirdNET, a deep neural network for automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, and its application in monitoring threatened species. The context also mentions the settings adjusted in BirdNET, such as detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during training.
