The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the method used for collecting acoustic data in a study. According to the context, an acoustic recorder (Song Meter SM2 recorder) was deployed at each site to collect data. The recorder was programmed to record the first 15 minutes of each hour in .wav format, with a sampling rate of 48 kHz and 16 bits per sample resolution. The devices were checked weekly to download data and change batteries. This method was used to collect a total of 32,023 15-minute recordings (8006 hours of recording) across four stations.
