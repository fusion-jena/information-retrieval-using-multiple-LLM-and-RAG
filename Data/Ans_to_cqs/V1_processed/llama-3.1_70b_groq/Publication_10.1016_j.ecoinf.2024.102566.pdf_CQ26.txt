I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, specifically discussing downscaled forest biomass density and factors that could be incorporated into a comprehensive model. It does not mention deep learning, data bias, or preprocessing techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the query.
