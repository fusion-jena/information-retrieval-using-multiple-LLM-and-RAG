The provided context mentions the issue of imbalanced data and its impact on CNN models. To address this issue, the researchers used data resampling to create a new model with evenly distributed classes. This technique is similar to oversampling, where the minority class is duplicated to balance the data.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Stratified splitting is a technique used to split the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes. Undersampling involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the data. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the data is representative of the population.

The context does mention that the researchers used images of six butterfly families to create their dataset, which could be considered a form of diverse data collection. However, it is not explicitly stated as a technique used to address data bias.

In summary, the context mentions data resampling (similar to oversampling) as a technique used to address data bias, but does not provide information on other techniques such as stratified splitting, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
