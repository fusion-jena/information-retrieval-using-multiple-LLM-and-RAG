Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, model architecture, and results. It discusses the calculation of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values and the comparison of inference-time to determine the most computationally efficient model. However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
