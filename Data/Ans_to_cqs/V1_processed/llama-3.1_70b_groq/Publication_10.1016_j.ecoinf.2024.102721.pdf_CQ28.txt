I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It appears to be a research article focused on forecasting ecological water demand using deep learning methods, and it discusses various technical aspects of the model, such as the structure of the long- and short-term memory model neural network and the use of Bayesian optimization. However, it does not provide information on the deployment platform used.
