I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the platform used for such deployment. The context appears to be related to a study on land use/land cover, beekeeping, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
