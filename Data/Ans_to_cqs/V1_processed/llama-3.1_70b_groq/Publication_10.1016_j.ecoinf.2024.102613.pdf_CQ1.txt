The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that data are collected from various sources, such as sensors, electronic resources (e.g., text, video, image), and public resources. 

It can be inferred that sensors are one of the methods used for collecting raw data, as mentioned in the context. Additionally, the context mentions that data are generated in different forms (i.e., structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), but it does not provide further information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that sensors are one of the methods used for collecting raw data, but the context does not provide a comprehensive list of methods used in the deep learning pipeline.
