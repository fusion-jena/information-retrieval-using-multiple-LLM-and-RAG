Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "Links to download data and code can be found within the paper" in Section 3.2.3. This suggests that the data repository may be linked within the paper itself, but the exact location (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) is not specified.
