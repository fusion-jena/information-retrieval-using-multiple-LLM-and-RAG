Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on bird species detection and classification using audio recordings, and mentions datasets such as Xeno-canto and the Macaulay library of sounds, which are specific to bird vocalizations. It does not provide information on the datasets used in general deep learning pipelines.
