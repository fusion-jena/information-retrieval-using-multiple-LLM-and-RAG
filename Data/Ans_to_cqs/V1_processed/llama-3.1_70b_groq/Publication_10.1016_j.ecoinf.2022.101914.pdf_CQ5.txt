I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study on species distribution modeling using various machine learning and regression-based approaches, including Random Forest, Generalized Linear Models, and Maximum Entropy software. The datasets used in this study are not specified, but they seem to be related to presence and background points for a particular species, rather than image or deep learning datasets.
