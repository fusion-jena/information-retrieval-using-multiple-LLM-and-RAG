Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be a collection of results from various machine learning models, including their performance metrics such as R, RMSE, and MAPE, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
