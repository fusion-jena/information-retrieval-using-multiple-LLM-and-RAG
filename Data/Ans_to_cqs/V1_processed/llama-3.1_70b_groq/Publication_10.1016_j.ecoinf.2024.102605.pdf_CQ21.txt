Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, ecological informatics, and machine learning, but it does not provide specific information on the postprocessing steps involved in model training.

However, based on general knowledge of machine learning and model training, common postprocessing steps may include:

* Saliency maps: These are visual representations of the model's predictions, highlighting the most important features or inputs that contribute to the predictions.
* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, etc. to evaluate the performance of the model.
* Confusion matrix: This is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

But, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved in the context of the provided research papers and articles.
