I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to marine biology, ecology, and conservation, with references to research papers and datasets. There is no mention of deep learning or data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
