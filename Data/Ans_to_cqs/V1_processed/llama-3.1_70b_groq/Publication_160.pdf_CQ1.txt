The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "a large database of annotated photographic quadrats" for training the deep CNN architectures. This suggests that the raw data may be collected through photographic surveys or monitoring efforts, possibly involving underwater photography or videography. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "photo quadrats" which implies that the data may be collected through a systematic sampling method, where photographs are taken at regular intervals or in a grid pattern. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified in the provided context.
