Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and components of the Wav2Vec model, Attention-based CNN-LSTM, and Hybrid CNN-LSTM, as well as their applications in speech recognition and bird vocalization classification. It does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
