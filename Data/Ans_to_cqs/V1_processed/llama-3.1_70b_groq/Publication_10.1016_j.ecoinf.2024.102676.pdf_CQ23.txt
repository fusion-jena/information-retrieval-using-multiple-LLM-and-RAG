Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The text discusses the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method and its enhancement using missing value imputation, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, it is mentioned that the study used a dataset of footprints from different species, including Amur tiger, cheetah, giant panda, and mountain lion, which might suggest that the dataset is diverse. Additionally, the study used a combination of intuitive and machine-learning-based methods, which could indicate that the authors took steps to ensure the robustness of the model.

But without more specific information, it is impossible to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
