Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to a research paper on soil nutrient concentration analysis using various machine learning techniques, including PLSR (Partial Least Squares Regression), SVM (Support Vector Machine), and others. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
