Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model preparation, feature extraction, and training process using PyTorch and scikit-learn libraries. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or deployment. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
