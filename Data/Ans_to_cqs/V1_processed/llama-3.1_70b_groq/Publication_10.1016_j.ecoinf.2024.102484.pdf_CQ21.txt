Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about model training, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a study on soil degradation and land use, with discussions on data collection, geographical detectors, and research limitations.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it seems unrelated to the provided context.
