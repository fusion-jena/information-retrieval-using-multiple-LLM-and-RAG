The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to increase the size and variability of the dataset, which can help mitigate data bias. The context states that random cropping, horizontal/vertical flipping, image rotation, image translation, zooming, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, hue and saturation adjustment, gaussian noise, and random erasing were applied to both models during training.

Additionally, the context mentions the concept of domain adaptation, which involves aligning the marginal data distribution between the target and source domains to address the issue of data distribution shifts in different locations. However, this is not specifically related to preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique mentioned that can be related to addressing data bias is data augmentation. Other techniques mentioned in the query are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
