Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the D-Mask R-CNN model, its application to fauna and flora, and the research background of Dimitri Korsch.

However, it does mention the use of weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. This suggests that the model may be leveraging transfer learning to reduce overfitting, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
