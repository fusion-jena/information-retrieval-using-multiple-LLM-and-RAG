Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the conversion of data formats, object detection algorithms, and the EfficientDet architecture, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
