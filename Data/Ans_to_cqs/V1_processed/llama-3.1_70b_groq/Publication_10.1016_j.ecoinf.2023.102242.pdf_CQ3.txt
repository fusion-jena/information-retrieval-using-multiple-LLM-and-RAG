Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on object-oriented classification methods, random forest classification, and semantic segmentation, but it does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of object-oriented classification, which may involve annotating objects or regions of interest in images. Additionally, the context references a paper by Girshick et al. (2014) on "Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation," which may imply the use of bounding box annotation or other annotation techniques for object detection tasks.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to the query.
