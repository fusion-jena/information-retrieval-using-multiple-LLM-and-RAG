Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training and evaluation of the model, including the use of a Tesla K80 GPU for 5 epochs, data augmentation, and sensitivity studies. It also provides details on the number of tree annotations used for pretraining, retraining, and evaluation.

However, it does mention that the model was retrained using the hand-annotated data for 40 epochs, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed or serialized. Additionally, there is no mention of platform selection for deployment.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
