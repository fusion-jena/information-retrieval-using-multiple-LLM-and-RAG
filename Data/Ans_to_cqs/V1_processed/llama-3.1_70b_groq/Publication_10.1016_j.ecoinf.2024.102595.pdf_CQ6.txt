According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Division of the preprocessed data into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) for model training and testing purposes.
2. Transformation of the data using techniques such as MinMaxScaler, which is especially crucial for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data, such as Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and neural networks.
3. Encoding of categorical fields into numerical values using LabelEncoder, as agricultural datasets often include categorical data that must be encoded before being fed into machine learning algorithms.

Additionally, the context mentions the importance of hyper-parameter tuning via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10) for model training. However, it does not explicitly mention other preprocessing steps such as cleaning or normalization.
