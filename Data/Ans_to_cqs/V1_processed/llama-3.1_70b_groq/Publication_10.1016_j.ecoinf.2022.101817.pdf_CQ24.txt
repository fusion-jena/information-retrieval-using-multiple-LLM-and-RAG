The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of repeated random sub-sampling to generate five different datasets from the extracted frames. This suggests that the authors may have employed some form of randomization or shuffling of the data to introduce variability in the training and testing process.

Additionally, the context mentions that the frame selection process was carried out using a Python script which randomly selected the frames using a uniform distribution. This implies that the authors may have used a random number generator to select the frames, but it does not provide information on whether a fixed random seed value was used to ensure reproducibility.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
