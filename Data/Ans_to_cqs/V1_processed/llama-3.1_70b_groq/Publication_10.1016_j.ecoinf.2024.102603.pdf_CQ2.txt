The provided context mentions that deep learning models can handle both structured and unstructured data, such as images and text. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning models can accommodate both structured and unstructured data, but it does not specify the exact formats, such as CSV, audio, or video. Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that images and text are used, but I do not know about other formats.
