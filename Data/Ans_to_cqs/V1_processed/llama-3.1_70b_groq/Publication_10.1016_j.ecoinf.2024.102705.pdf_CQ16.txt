The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the training process consisted of 150 epochs with a batch size that gradually decreased from 4 to 4 over the course of training, and the learning rate initially started at 10^-4 and decreased over time. This suggests that the training process was designed to run for a fixed number of epochs, rather than being stopped based on a specific criteria such as a validation loss plateau.
