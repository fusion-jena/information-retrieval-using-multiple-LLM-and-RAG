Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. The text only discusses the performance comparison of different models, hyperparameter optimization, and the results of the experiments, but it does not provide information about the hardware setup used for training the models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
