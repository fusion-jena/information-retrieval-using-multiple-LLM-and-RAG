The purpose of the deep learning model is object retrieval with deep convolutional neural networks, as mentioned in the paper by Mohedano et al. (2017). Additionally, Petrovska et al. (2020) used deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing, specifically for aerial scene classification. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in these contexts is classification.
