The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is used to recognize and classify endemic bird species. The text mentions that the model is trained on a dataset of images of birds and is used to extract features and make predictions. The specific task is not explicitly stated as classification, but based on the context, it appears that the model is being used for classification purposes, such as identifying the species of a bird from an image.
