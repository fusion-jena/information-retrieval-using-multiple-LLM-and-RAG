The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the context provided are:

1. Precision: The ratio of correctly classified positive samples (True Positive) to the total number of classified positive samples (either incorrectly or correctly).
2. Recall: The ratio of the number of positive samples (True Positive) correctly classified as Positive to the total number of Positive samples.
3. Mean Average Precision (mAP): A metric that combines precision and recall.
4. Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU): A metric used to evaluate the performance of the model on the 'LookingForSeagrass' dataset.
5. Accuracy: A metric used to evaluate the performance of the model, although it is not explicitly defined in the context.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of various deep learning models, including CNN, Faster R-CNN, and DeepLabv3+, on different datasets, such as ECUHO-1, ECUHO-2, and 'LookingForSeagrass'.
