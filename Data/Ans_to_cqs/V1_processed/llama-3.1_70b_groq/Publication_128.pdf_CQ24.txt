The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention that the batch size is set to 30 when training, but images are tested one by one. This could potentially help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process.

Additionally, the context mentions that the learning rate and dropout rate are set to the same value (0.001), and the bias value is set to 0. This could help reduce the impact of randomness in the model's weights and biases.

However, it does not provide any information on how randomness is handled in terms of random seed value. It is possible that the authors used a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of the results, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
