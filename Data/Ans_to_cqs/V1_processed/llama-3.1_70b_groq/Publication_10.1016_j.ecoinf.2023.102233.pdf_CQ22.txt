The text does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention the use of macro-averaged Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as a metric to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, it mentions the calculation of reliable evaluation metrics, but it does not specify which metrics are used. It also mentions the challenge of evaluating the model on highly imbalanced and unlabelled test data, and the need for additional research to investigate more appropriate evaluation methods.
