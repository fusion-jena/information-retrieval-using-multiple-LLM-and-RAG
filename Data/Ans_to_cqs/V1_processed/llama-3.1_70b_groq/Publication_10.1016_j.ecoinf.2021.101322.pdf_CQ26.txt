The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning and pre-trained network weights, which can help alleviate issues related to sparse and narrowly distributed datasets.

One relevant technique mentioned in the context is the use of expert reading of extra images to increase the size of the dataset. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a large and diverse pre-trained dataset (ImageNet) to shape the lower-level features of the network.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a group average of several estimators to reduce single reader biases, but this is more related to the labeling approach rather than a specific technique for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query, but it does mention a few techniques that can help address data bias issues, such as transfer learning, pre-trained network weights, and increasing the size of the dataset through expert reading.
