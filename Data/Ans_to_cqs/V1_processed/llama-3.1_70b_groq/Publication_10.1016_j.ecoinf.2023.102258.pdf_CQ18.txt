Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses query-time adaptation, transductive few-shot learning, and various approaches to sound event detection, but it does not provide information on how model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
