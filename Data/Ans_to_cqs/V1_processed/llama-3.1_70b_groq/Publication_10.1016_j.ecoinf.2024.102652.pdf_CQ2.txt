Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data, specifically multispectral images. The text mentions the use of a 5-band multispectral image, which is later modified by adding five salinity indices, increasing the total number of bands. The images are then split into training and testing sets, with 70% used for training and 30% used for testing.

There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. Additionally, while CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common data format used in many machine learning pipelines, there is no explicit mention of CSV being used in this specific pipeline.

It is worth noting that the pipeline also uses ground truth images, which are used to train and test the proposed model. However, the format of these images is not explicitly stated.

Overall, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically multispectral images.
