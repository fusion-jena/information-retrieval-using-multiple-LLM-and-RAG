Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to soil moisture estimation, remote sensing, and spatial modeling, but it does not discuss deep learning or optimization techniques in detail.

However, I can provide some general information on common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Some popular optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSProp, and Adagrad, among others. These techniques are used to minimize the loss function and update the model's parameters during training.

But, I must emphasize that this information is not derived from the provided context, and I'm not aware of the specific optimization techniques used in the context of the provided references.

Therefore, my answer is:

I don't know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
