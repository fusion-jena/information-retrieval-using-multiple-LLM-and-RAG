The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline is primarily focused on image data, specifically remote sensing imagery and wetland classification maps. The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the context includes figures showing wetland classification maps and examples of extracted features of an urban object using CNNs, further suggesting that image data is the primary focus. 

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are also not mentioned, but it is possible that they may be used for storing or processing metadata or other non-image data. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm this.
