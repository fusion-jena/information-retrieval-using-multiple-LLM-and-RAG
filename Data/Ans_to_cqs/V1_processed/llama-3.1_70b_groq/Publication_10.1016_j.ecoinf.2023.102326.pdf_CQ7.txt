Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the analysis of urban acoustic environments, but it does not provide information on the data splitting criteria used for training a deep learning model.

The context mentions the use of machine learning approaches for sound event classification, but it does not delve into the specifics of the data splitting process. It also mentions the use of Bootstrap samples to calculate the average shortest path length (ASPL) for each hour by device, but this is not directly related to the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
