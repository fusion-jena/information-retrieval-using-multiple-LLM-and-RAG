The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "aerial images of KNP" and "image classification" in the text, it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the pipeline. The context also mentions the use of GLCM texture metrics, which are typically applied to image data. There is no mention of audio or video data formats, and CSV is not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline. Therefore, the answer is that image data is likely used in the pipeline, but the exact format (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, etc.) is not specified.
