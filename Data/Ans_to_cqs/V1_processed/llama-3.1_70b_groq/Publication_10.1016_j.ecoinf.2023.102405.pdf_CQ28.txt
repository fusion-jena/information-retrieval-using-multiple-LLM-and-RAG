I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the challenges of water contamination in aquaculture, the limitations of traditional methods for evaluating water contamination, and the potential of integrating computer technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Data Analytics to address this issue. It also presents a comprehensive framework that incorporates IoT-based data collection and data segregation techniques, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the deep learning model.
