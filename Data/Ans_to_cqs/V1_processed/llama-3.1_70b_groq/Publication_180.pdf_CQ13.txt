The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that two parameters were adjusted from their default values: validation percentage and number of training steps. 

The validation percentage was increased from the default value of 10% to 16% due to the small number of images available for some species. The number of training steps was also adjusted, with the default value being 4000 steps. The optimal number of training steps was found to be 2000 for the Mexican dataset, which resulted in an 83.0% overall identification rate.

No information is provided about the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters used in the model.
