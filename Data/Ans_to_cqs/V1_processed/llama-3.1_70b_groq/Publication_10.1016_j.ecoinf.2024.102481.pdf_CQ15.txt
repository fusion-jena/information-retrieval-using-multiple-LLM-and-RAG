I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, in predicting reproductive condition in fish. It also mentions other machine learning algorithms and their applications in fisheries biology, but it does not delve into the details of optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
