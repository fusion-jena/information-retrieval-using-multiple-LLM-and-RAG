The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Specifically, it is mentioned that data augmentation was used, resulting in a 12-fold increase in the number of images (from 1,248 to 14,896). This suggests that the authors attempted to increase the diversity of the training data to improve the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a dataset of 22 fishing sets, which may indicate that the authors attempted to use a diverse dataset to train the model. However, it is not clear if the dataset was stratified or if cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance.

Overall, while the context suggests that some measures were taken to improve the model's generalizability, such as data augmentation, it does not provide explicit information on the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting.
