The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics, including:

* Accuracy: measures the proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images.
* Precision: measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
* Recall: measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances.
* F1 Score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
* Confusion Matrix: tabulates the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative counts, providing a detailed breakdown of model performance.

These metrics provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the deep learning models and help to identify areas for improvement.
