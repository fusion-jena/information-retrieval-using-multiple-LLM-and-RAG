The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the ImageNet dataset. The model, specifically the ResNet-101 feature extractor, was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned on the dataset of herbarium sheet images. The specific dataset of herbarium sheet images is not explicitly mentioned, but it is mentioned that the model was fine-tuned on it.
