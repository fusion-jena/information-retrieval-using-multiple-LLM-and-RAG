The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the deep learning model, which combines gated recurrent units (GRU) with a regular neural network, and the hyperparameter analysis for the GRU-DNN model. It also discusses the use of dropout as a regularization strategy to deal with overfitting, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.
