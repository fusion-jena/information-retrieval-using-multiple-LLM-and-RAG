Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of GPUs in machine learning, particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and particle filters, as well as the application of machine learning in ecology. It mentions the use of visual images and acoustic recordings as typical machine learning applications, but it does not provide information on how these data were collected.

However, it can be inferred that the data collection methods may vary depending on the specific application. For instance, in ecology, data collection methods might include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. In the case of animal audio classification mentioned in the context (Nanni et al., 2020), the data might have been collected using audio recorders or sensors. Nevertheless, without more specific information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this question.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
