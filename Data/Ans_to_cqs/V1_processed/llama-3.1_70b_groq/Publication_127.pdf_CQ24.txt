Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on deep learning architectures, image recognition, and their applications in wildlife ecology.

However, it does mention the process of randomly selecting images for the dataset, stating that "25% (757,000) nonempty images and randomly selected 757,000 empty images" were used. This suggests that randomness is used in data selection, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

To answer the query, I would need more information or context about the specific deep learning pipeline being referred to. Without this information, I cannot provide a definitive answer on the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
