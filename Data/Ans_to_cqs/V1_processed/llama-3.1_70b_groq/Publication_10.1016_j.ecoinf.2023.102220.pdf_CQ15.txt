Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the use of the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function for the hidden layers and the sigmoid activation function for the output layer, as well as the use of the LSTM method. It also mentions the use of the TensorFlow library, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
