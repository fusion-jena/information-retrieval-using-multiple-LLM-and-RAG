The dataset is divided chronologically, with 70% allocated to the training set, 10% to the validation set, and 20% to the test set. This allocation strategy is used to simulate real-world scenarios and enhance the generalizability of the model by ensuring that the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data.
