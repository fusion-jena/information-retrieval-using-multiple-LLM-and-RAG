Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for image segmentation and fractional vegetation coverage estimation in arid regions. It discusses the performance of different models, such as Unet, Pspnet, and Deeplabv3+, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of deep learning models, which often involve random initialization of weights and biases. Additionally, the context cites a survey on image segmentation using deep learning, which may touch on strategies for handling randomness, but this information is not explicitly provided in the given context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
