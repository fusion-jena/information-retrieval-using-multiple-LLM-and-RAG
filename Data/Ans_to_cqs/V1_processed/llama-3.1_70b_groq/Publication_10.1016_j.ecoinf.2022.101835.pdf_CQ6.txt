Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the optimization of hyperparameters for machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree models, using the Optuna library. It discusses the performance of these models on a specific task, but does not mention any preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know what preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model in this specific context.
