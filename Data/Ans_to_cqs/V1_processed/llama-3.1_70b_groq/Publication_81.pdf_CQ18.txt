The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, which is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. The confusion matrix is used to calculate three evaluation metrics: accuracy, recall, and F1-Score.

The accuracy, recall, and F1-Score are calculated using the following equations:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-Score = 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model on different datasets, including Sciaenidae, Barbinae, and Mugilidae. The results are presented in Table 4, which shows the accuracy, recall, and F1-Score for the SK and ESK models on each dataset.

While the context does not explicitly state the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using the confusion matrix and the three evaluation metrics mentioned above.
