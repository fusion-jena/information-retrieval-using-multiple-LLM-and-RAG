The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model include overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient (KC), producer's accuracy (PA), user's accuracy (UA), commission error (CE), and omission error (OE). These metrics are defined based on the values of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN), and are reported in a confusion matrix format.
