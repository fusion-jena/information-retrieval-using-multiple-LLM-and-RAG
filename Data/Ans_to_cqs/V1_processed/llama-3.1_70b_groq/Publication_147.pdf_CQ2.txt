The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the data used is likely in the form of images, specifically satellite images from Sentinel-2. This is because the context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 bands (e.g., Band 2, Band 3, Band 4, Band 8) and the calculation of indices such as NDVI, NDWI, and REIP, which are commonly used in remote sensing applications. Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are typically used for image classification tasks. Therefore, it is likely that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically satellite images in a format such as GeoTIFF or JPEG.
