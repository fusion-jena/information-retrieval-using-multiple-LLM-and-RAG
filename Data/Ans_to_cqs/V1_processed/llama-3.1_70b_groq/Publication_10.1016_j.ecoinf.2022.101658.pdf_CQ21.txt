Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on the methodology and field measurements used for training and testing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation of fuel types. It also mentions the use of the R programming language and environment for statistical computing, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used after model training.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
