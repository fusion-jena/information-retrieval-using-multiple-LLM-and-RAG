Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context focuses on the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization and its application to LSTM neural networks, but does not provide information on the specific frameworks used for building the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
