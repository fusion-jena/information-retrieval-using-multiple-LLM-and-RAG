Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the experimental setup, including the batch size and GPU utilization, as well as the performance of different models on the PAD Lite dataset. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method is used.
