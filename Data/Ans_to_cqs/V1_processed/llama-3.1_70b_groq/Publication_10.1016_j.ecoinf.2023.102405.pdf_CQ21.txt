Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, specifically the AODEGRU model, and data pre-processing steps. It does mention "Confusion matrix analysis" in section 4.3, but it does not provide details on the postprocessing steps involved.

However, based on general machine learning practices, common postprocessing steps after model training may include:

* Calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
* Creating confusion matrices to evaluate the model's performance
* Generating saliency maps to visualize the model's feature importance
* Performing error analysis to identify areas for model improvement
* Hyperparameter tuning to further optimize the model's performance

But, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved in this particular study, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
