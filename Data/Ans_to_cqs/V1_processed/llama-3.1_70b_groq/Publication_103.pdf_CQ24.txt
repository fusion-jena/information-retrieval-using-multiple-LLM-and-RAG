The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the neural network was initialized randomly in the R.CR.CR experiment, indicating that randomness is present in the initialization process.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of batch normalization, which can help reduce internal covariate shift and may indirectly affect the impact of randomness in the network. However, this is not a direct strategy for handling randomness.

The context also references several papers and frameworks, such as Caffe, that may employ strategies for handling randomness, but these are not explicitly discussed in the provided text.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
