Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the data is stored. The text mentions that the dataset will be created from scratch and annotated for custom training, but it does not provide information on where the dataset will be made available. It mentions that the images are saved in a database, but it does not specify the type of database or its location. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
