I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions, drought characteristics, and climate modes/indices/teleconnections. It provides information on data sources, spatial and temporal resolutions, and formulas for calculating drought severity and other metrics, but it does not mention the evaluation metrics for the deep learning model.
