Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on grasslands, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not specifically discuss deep learning models or their preprocessing steps. It mentions the use of Random Forest (RF) technique for classification, but it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
