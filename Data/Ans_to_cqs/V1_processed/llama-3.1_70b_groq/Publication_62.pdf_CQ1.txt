The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that natural history collections (NHCs) are being digitized, which implies that the raw data may be in the form of images of specimens. The context also mentions that digitization efforts are being made to compile specimen data and images, suggesting that the raw data may be collected through digitization of existing specimens and their associated data. Additionally, the context mentions that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being used for image classification, which further supports the idea that the raw data may be in the form of images. However, the specific methods used for collecting these images (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets) are not mentioned.
