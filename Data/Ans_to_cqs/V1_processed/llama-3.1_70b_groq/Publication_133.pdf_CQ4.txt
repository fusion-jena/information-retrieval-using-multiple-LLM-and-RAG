Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification and object detection tasks in the field of ecoinformatics. It also mentions the use of validation data to prevent overfitting and the training process of deep learning models.

However, it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's robustness to different orientations and scales.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
