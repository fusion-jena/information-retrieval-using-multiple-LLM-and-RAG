The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention two methods for dealing with multi-variate varying length audio data:

1. Repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2 seconds.
2. Directly resizing the audio image to a fixed size.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of different time-frequency representations (TFRs) as inputs to the CNNs, such as Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, and percussive-component based spectrogram. However, it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps applied to these TFRs.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide sufficient information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
