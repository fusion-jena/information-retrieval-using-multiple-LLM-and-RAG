Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses various components of the model, such as the backbone, neck, and head, and mentions specific architectures like EfficientNetV2 and Bottleneck Transformer, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these architectures. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
