Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to focus on object detection and tracking models, specifically discussing the performance of SORT and Deep SORT models, as well as various neural network architectures like Res2Net and ELAN.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Typically, randomness is handled by setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is often done using libraries like NumPy or PyTorch, which provide functions to set the random seed. Additionally, some deep learning frameworks may employ techniques like weight initialization or data shuffling to introduce randomness in a controlled manner.

Unfortunately, without more specific information from the provided context, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this query.
