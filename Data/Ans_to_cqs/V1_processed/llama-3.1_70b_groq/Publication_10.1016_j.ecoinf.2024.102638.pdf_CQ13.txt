The provided context does not specifically mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it does mention some hyperparameters that are commonly used in machine learning models, including:

* learning_rate (mentioned in the context of XGB and MLP)
* max_depth (mentioned in the context of TREE, RF, and XGB)
* n_estimators (mentioned in the context of RF and XGB)
* alpha (mentioned in the context of EN, GP, and MLP)
* hidden_layer_sizes (mentioned in the context of MLP)
* activation (mentioned in the context of MLP)

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive list of hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, and it's unclear whether the models mentioned are deep learning models or not. The context appears to be discussing a range of machine learning models, including traditional models like KNN and SVR, as well as more complex models like XGB and MLP.
