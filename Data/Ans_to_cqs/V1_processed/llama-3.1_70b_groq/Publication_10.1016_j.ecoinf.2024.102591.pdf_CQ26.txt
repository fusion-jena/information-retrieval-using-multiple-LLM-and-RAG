Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and fire mapping, with discussions on data processing, machine learning algorithms, and sensor data. 

However, it does mention the use of Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for FCOVER retrieval, which might be related to handling data bias. But it does not provide information on techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context.
