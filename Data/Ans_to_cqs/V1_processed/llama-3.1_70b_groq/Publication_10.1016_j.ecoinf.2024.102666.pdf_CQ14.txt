Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the stability of the search, the efficient standard marking system, and the impact of time and spatial factors on atmospheric correction, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
