The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention the use of "momentum" as one of the optimized parameters, with a search interval of [0.05, 0.25] and an optimized value of 0.845. This suggests that the optimization algorithm used may be a variant of SGD with momentum, but the specific algorithm is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a learning rate with a search interval of [0,1] and an optimized value of 0.096, which is a common hyperparameter in many optimization algorithms. However, without more information, it is difficult to determine the specific optimization technique used.

Therefore, while we can infer that the optimization algorithm likely involves momentum and a learning rate, the exact technique used (e.g., SGD, Adam) is not specified in the provided context.
