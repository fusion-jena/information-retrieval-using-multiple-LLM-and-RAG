Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the dataset, data preprocessing, and the general architecture of the model, but does not provide details on the hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
