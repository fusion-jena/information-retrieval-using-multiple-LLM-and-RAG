The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized, such as through grid search or random search. However, it does mention the use of various optimization algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the bat algorithm, to optimize model parameters. For example, Yan used GA and PSO to optimize a BP neural network to build a DO estimation model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of other optimization algorithms, such as the multi-verse optimizer, for parameter optimization.

It can be inferred that the hyperparameters of the models are likely optimized using these optimization algorithms, but the specific details of the optimization process, such as the use of grid search or random search, are not provided in the context.
