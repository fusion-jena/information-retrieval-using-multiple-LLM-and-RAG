Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for acoustic detection of covey calls, data augmentation, and the processing of acoustic data. It does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline, including regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
