I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of academic papers and articles related to environmental science, ecology, and agriculture. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context does not provide any information about a specific code repository or where it might be hosted (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
