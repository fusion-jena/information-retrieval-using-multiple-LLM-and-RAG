Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of representative and sufficient training samples, and the potential issues of data redundancy. However, it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

The text does mention the use of "feature optimization tools" to address the issue of training sample quality, but it does not elaborate on what these tools entail. It is possible that feature optimization may involve some form of preprocessing, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
