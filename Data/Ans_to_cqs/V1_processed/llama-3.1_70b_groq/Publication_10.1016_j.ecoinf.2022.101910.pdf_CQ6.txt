Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the application of BirdNET, a deep neural network for automated bird species identification, and its evaluation on a specific dataset. It discusses the settings that can be adjusted in BirdNET, such as detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold, but does not delve into the preprocessing steps involved in training the model.

However, it is generally known that preprocessing steps are crucial in deep learning model development. Typical preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, normalization, scaling, and feature extraction. But without specific information from the context, it is impossible to provide a detailed answer to this question.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in this specific context.
