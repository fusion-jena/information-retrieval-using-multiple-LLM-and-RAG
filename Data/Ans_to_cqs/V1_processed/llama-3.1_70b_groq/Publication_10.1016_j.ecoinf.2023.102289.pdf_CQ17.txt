Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the LaDeco module, its functionality, and the pre-trained models used, but it does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline or regularization techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
