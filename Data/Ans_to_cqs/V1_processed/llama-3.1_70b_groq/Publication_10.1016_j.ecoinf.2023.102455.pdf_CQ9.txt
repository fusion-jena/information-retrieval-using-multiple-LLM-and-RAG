I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a description of the model architecture, hyperparameters, and performance metrics, but it does not provide information about where the data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
