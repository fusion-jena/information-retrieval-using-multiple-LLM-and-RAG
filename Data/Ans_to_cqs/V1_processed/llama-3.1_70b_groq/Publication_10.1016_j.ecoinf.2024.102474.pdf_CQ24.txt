The text does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors "resorted to purely deterministic variants of these architectures." This suggests that the authors may have avoided using random elements in their models, instead opting for deterministic approaches. 

There is no mention of random seed values or how they are handled. The text does mention the use of an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure, but it does not provide further details on how randomness is handled in this process. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the text does not provide information on the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
