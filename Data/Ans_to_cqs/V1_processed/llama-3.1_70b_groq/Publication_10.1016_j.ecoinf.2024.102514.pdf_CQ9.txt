Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are mostly research papers and articles related to machine learning, water quality, and ecological informatics, but none of them mention a specific data repository.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question. The data repository might be mentioned in a different part of the study or in a different document, but it is not mentioned in the provided context.
