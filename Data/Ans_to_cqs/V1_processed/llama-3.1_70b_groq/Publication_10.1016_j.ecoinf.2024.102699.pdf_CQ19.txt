Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The text mentions various model architectures such as DenseNet-161, ResNet-50, and Vision Transformers (ViT), but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models.

However, it is worth noting that the text mentions the use of librosa, a Python library for audio signal processing, which is often used in conjunction with popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Additionally, the text mentions the use of AudioSet, a large-scale audio dataset, which is also often used with these frameworks.

Despite these hints, the text does not provide a clear answer to the question, and therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models.
