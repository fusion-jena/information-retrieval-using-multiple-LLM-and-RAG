Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be focused on the performance of different machine learning models, such as Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge, as well as the results of YOLOv8 after various preprocessing methods. 

However, it does mention the calculation of certain metrics, such as precision, recall, mAP50, and mAP50-95, which are likely calculated after model training. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a validation set, which implies that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is being performed. 

But, it does not provide information on the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
