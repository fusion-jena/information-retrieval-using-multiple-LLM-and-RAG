Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning in vegetation studies, plant species identification, and ecology. It mentions various studies and papers related to these topics but does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques.

However, it does mention the use of computer vision systems, such as LeafNet, for automatic plant species identification, which may involve data annotation techniques. But the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
