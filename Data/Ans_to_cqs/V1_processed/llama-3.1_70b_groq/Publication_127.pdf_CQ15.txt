Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a related concept in reference 51, which discusses the "saddle point problem in high-dimensional non-convex optimization." This suggests that the authors are aware of the challenges in optimizing deep learning models, but the specific optimization techniques used are not mentioned.

Some of the references provided, such as reference 13 (Goodfellow et al., 2016), are from well-known deep learning researchers and may discuss optimization techniques in the context of deep learning. However, without access to the full text of these references, it is impossible to determine the specific optimization techniques mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
