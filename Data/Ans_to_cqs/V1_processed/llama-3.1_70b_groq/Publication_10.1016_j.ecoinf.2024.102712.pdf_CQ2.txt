Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and forestry, but it does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or the data formats used in such pipelines.

The context mentions the use of remote sensing images, specifically Sentinel-2 data, and the processing of this data in QGIS using the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin. However, it does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
