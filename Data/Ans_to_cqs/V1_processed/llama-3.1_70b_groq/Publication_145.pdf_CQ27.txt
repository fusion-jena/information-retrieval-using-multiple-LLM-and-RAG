Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the training process, including the optimizer used (RMSprop), the initial learning rate (0.0001), the number of epochs (300), and the batch size (24 images per batch). Additionally, it mentions the programming language and frameworks used (R, Rstudio, Keras, and TensorFlow) and the hardware used for training and prediction (Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory).

However, it does mention that prediction using the GPU of a single tile of 16,384 pixels took approximately 6 minutes, which suggests that the model was deployed and used for prediction, but the exact process followed for deployment is not specified.
