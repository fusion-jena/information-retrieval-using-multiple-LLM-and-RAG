The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves remote sensing data, specifically satellite imagery. The context mentions the use of Pleiades-1B satellite imagery with four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near infrared) and one panchromatic band. This suggests that the pipeline involves image data, specifically multi-spectral and panchromatic images. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which further supports the involvement of image data. However, it does not provide information on the specific data formats used (e.g., GeoTIFF, JPEG, etc.).
