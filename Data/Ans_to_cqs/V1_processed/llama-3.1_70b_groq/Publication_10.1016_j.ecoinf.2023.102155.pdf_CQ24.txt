Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses methods for handling missing data, such as k-nearest neighbors (knn), k-means, and random assignment of initial point labels. It also mentions the use of lasso regularization and bias correction. However, it does not provide information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
