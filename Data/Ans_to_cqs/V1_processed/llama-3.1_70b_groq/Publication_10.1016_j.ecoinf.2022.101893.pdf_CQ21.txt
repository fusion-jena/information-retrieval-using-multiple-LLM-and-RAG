Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, feature selection, and result analysis, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
