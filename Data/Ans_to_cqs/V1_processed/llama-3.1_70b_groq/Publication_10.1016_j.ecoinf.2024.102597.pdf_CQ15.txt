Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. In fact, the context mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered but not used due to the limited number of samples. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
