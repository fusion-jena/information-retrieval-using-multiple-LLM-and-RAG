I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and the effects of sample size on their performance, as well as methods for addressing sampling bias in SDMs. There is no mention of deep learning or any specific type of deep learning model.
