I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on the effects of land use changes on flooding in the Umia River Basin, and it discusses parameters related to soil infiltration capacity and runoff, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning model.
