The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. It discusses Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) and the ibis.iSDM package, which supports various engines for inferring or projecting the relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features. These engines include regression and non-parametric machine learning approaches, as well as frequentist and Bayesian methods. However, it does not specifically mention deep learning models or their applications. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query.
