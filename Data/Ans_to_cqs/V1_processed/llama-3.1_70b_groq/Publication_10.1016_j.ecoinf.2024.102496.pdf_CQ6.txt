Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental science and engineering, discussing topics such as water quality, nutrient reduction, and best management practices (BMPs). It does not provide any information about deep learning or machine learning preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
