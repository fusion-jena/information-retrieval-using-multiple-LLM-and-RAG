Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the performance comparison of different deep learning models, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to build these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
