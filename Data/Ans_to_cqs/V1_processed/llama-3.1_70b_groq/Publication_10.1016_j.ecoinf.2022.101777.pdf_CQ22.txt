The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the metrics used for accuracy assessment in the context of image classification. The metrics mentioned are:

* Error of Commission (EC)
* Error of Omission (EO)
* Producer Accuracy (PA)
* User Accuracy (UA)

These metrics are used to assess the reliability of the results and are computed based on an error matrix resulting from accuracy assessment.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention common deep learning evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. The metrics mentioned are more specific to the context of image classification and accuracy assessment.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot confirm the use of metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model.
