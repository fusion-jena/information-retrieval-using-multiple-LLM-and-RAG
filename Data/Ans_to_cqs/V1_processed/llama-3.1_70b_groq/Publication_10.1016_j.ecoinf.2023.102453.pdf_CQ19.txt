The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. However, it does mention TensorFlow and its variant TensorFlow Lite, which is used for model deployment to edge devices. It also mentions Keras, which is a high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow. There is no mention of PyTorch or any other frameworks. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer is that TensorFlow and Keras are mentioned as frameworks related to the deep learning models, but it is not explicitly stated that they are used to build the models.
