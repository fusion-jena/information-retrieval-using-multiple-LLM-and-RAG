The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. According to the provided context, the model is used to analyze images of fish and classify them into different species. The model is trained on a dataset of annotated fish thumbnails and is compared to human performance in identifying the species of fish in the images. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is a type of deep learning algorithm commonly used for image classification tasks. The context mentions that the model is used to "analyze data and particularly to classify objects from images", which further supports the conclusion that the purpose of the model is classification.
