According to the provided context, one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout regularization. Dropout regularization randomly removes different sets of neurons using a predetermined dropout rate, resulting in training different neural networks and reducing overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). This method is mentioned as being essential for controlling overfitting as network depth and complexity increase (Gupta and Raza, 2020).

However, L2 regularization is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as a method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. 

It is worth noting that the context mentions that determining the optimal DNN architecture is an active area of research, and different techniques for tuning hyperparameters, such as network structure, activation functions, regularization, and optimization algorithms, are being evaluated. This suggests that other regularization methods may be used in the deep learning pipeline, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
