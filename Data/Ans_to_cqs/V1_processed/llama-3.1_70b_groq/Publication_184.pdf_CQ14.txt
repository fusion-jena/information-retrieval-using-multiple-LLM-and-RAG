Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only lists the hyperparameters used to train and validate the Yolo model, as shown in Table 1, but does not provide information on the optimization process. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters are optimized.
