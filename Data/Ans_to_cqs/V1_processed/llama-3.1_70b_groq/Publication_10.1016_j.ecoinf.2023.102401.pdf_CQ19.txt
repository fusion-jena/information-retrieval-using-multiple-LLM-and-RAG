Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of deep learning algorithms and models such as YWnet, Centernet, Efficientdet, FasterRCNN, YOLOv4, YOLOv7, and YOLOx, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
