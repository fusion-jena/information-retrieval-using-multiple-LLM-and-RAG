Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the papers mentioned, it can be inferred that some of the papers may have used bounding box annotation, as they are related to object detection tasks.

For example, the paper "CME-YOLOv5: an efficient object detection network for densely spaced fish and small targets" by Li et al. (2022b) likely used bounding box annotation, as YOLOv5 is an object detection algorithm that requires bounding box annotations.

Similarly, the paper "Fish detection method based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images" by Qin et al. (2022) may have used bounding box annotation or other annotation techniques, but the specific technique is not mentioned.

The paper "A novel automated approach for fish biomass estimation in turbid environments through deep learning, object detection, and regression" by Rani et al. (2024) mentions object detection, which may involve bounding box annotation, but the specific annotation technique is not specified.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation may have been used in some of the papers, particularly those related to object detection tasks. However, the specific annotation techniques used in each paper are not explicitly mentioned.
