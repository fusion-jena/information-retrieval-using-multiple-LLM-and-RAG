Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained and tested using three different data processing methods, which suggests that some form of cross-validation or data splitting may have been used.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained and tested on a dataset listed in Table 1, but the details of the dataset and the data splitting method used are not provided. It is also not clear if the dataset was diverse or if stratified splitting was used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query. However, it appears that some form of data splitting or cross-validation may have been used, but the specific details are not provided.
