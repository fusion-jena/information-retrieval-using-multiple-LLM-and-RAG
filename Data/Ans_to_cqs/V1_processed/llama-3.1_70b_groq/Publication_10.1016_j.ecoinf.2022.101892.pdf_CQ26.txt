The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques used to handle imbalanced data and overfitting.

According to the context, the authors applied aggressive data augmentation to avoid overfitting and imbalanced problems. They also used a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) cross-validation technique to ensure that the same subject did not appear in the training set and testing set at the same time. This technique helps to eliminate the influence of individuals and reduce bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the original images were captured under different illumination and angles, and the authors augmented all training sets randomly via horizontal flipping. This suggests that they used data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the data and reduce bias.

However, the context does not mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. It also does not mention diverse data collection as a technique used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the authors used data augmentation and five-fold subject-exclusive cross-validation to address data bias, but it is not clear if they used other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.
