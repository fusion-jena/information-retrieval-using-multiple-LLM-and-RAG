Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on bird species recognition, bioacoustics analysis, and the use of deep neural networks for classification tasks.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In general, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the deep learning pipeline, such as data augmentation, weight initialization, and stochastic gradient descent. To handle this randomness, researchers often employ techniques such as:

1. Fixing the random seed: This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated, making the results reproducible.
2. Averaging over multiple runs: This involves training and evaluating the model multiple times with different random seeds and averaging the results to reduce the effect of randomness.
3. Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization: These techniques can help reduce the effect of randomness in the model by introducing regularization and normalization.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not discuss these strategies in detail, and I couldn't find any specific information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. If you're looking for more information on this topic, I recommend consulting additional resources or research papers that focus on deep learning and randomness.
