Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and citations related to unmanned aircraft systems, wildlife research, and biodiversity monitoring, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
