I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model, its hyperparameters, learning rate, or optimizer. The context appears to be related to fire severity, combustion efficiency, and data ranges, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
