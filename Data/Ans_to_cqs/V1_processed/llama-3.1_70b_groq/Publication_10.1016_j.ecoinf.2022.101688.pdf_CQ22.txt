The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is the F1 score. This is evident from Table 4, which compares the average F1 score across different network architectures and dataset configurations. Additionally, the text mentions that the results are ordered based on the average F1 score, and the best-performing models are highlighted in bold. The F1 score is a measure of a model's accuracy on a specific task, and it is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. However, precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned as separate metrics in the provided context.
