I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to a study on estimating aboveground biomass using machine learning and remote sensing techniques, but it does not specifically mention deep learning. The mentioned models, such as SVR, XGBoost, RF, and MLR, are traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
