The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data was split into three parts: training (1232 image pairs), validation (176 image pairs), and testing (356 image pairs). This suggests that the data was split into a typical train-validation-test split, which is a common practice in deep learning. The exact criteria or ratio used for splitting the data is not specified.
