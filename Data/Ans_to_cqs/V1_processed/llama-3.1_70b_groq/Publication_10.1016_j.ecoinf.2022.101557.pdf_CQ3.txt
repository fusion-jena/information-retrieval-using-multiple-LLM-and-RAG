The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the data is annotated by humans, and the annotations are compared to those produced by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The context also mentions that the data is split into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels, but it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used.

The context does mention that the annotations are used to train a CNN model, and that the model is evaluated by comparing its annotations to those produced by humans. The evaluation is visualized in Figure 4, which shows the similarities and differences between the human and CNN annotations. However, the specific annotation techniques used to create the human annotations are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
