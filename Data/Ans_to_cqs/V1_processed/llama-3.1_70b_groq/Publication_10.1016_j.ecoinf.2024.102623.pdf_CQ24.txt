The text does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "The performance is averaged over 10 random seeds." This suggests that the authors are using a technique called "seed averaging" to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. By averaging the performance over multiple random seeds, the authors can reduce the impact of randomness and obtain a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.
