The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or specific data formats used in such a pipeline. However, it does mention that data analysis was conducted in R 4.0.5 and that gaping data were recorded at 1 Hz and averaged over 5 min or 1 min intervals. The context also mentions that daily curves of gaping for each sensor were used as input in the analysis, but it does not specify the format of these curves (e.g., CSV, image, audio, video). Therefore, I do not know the specific data formats used in the pipeline.
