I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. It only discusses the training process, including normalization and standardization of the data, batch size, optimizer, learning ratio, epochs, and loss function. It also mentions the use of a modified U-Net network for semantic segmentation, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
