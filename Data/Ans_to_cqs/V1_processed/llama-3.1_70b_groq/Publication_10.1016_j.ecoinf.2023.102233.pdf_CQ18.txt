The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation metric, specifically the F1 score. The model is trained on 70% of the training data and validated against 30% of the training data. The F1 score is used to evaluate the model's performance on the validation set, and the training process stops when successive model iterations do not reduce the F1 score. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is generalizing well to unseen data.
