Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the classification performance of different models, hyperparameter tuning, and the time required for training and testing phases, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it does mention the use of cross-validation (CV) accuracy, which suggests that the models may have been trained until convergence or until a certain level of CV accuracy was reached. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a learning rate and optimizer, which are typically used to control the training process, but it does not provide further details on the specific stopping criteria used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
