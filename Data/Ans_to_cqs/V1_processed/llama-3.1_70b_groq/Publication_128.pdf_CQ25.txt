The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The text mentions that the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for large dataset classification, and it describes the hidden neural network layers by convolutional kernels that capture essential details. The text also mentions that the model is used for plant image classification, specifically for identifying disease types in infected plant images. The model is trained to classify images into different categories, and it achieves a high classification accuracy over 95% in the spectrum region of plant health.
