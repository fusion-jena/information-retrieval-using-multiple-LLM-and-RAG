Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different classification models (EXP1, EXP2, EXP3, EXP4, and EXP5) and their performance in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa. It also discusses the problem of unbalanced training data and various sampling techniques used to address it.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved, as the results are compared using OA and Kappa. Additionally, the context mentions the creation of figures (Fig. 7, Fig. 8, and Fig. 9) that compare the classification results, which might involve some form of visualization or spatial comparison.

But, specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
