The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the pipeline. The context mentions the use of image processing techniques, convolutional neural networks, and object detection algorithms such as YOLO, which are typically used for image data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of MSR color correction algorithm, which is also used for image enhancement. 

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. The context does mention the use of CSV files, but only in the context of presenting results in a table format (Table 7), not as a data format used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the deep learning pipeline, but the exact data formats used are not explicitly mentioned.
