I don't know. The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a package called "covsel" for covariate selection in species distribution modeling (SDM), and it discusses algorithms, correlation coefficients, and other statistical concepts, but it does not mention deep learning or data annotation techniques.
