Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning and machine learning techniques for detecting artisanal small-scale mining, analyzing Amazonian rainforest phenology, and other environmental applications.

However, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline likely involves some form of random initialization or shuffling of data, which is a common practice in machine learning. But without explicit mention of strategies for handling randomness, it is difficult to provide a specific answer.

That being said, the context does mention the use of cloud-based machine learning and semi-automated reclassification, which might involve some form of randomization or shuffling of data. However, without further information, it is impossible to provide a specific answer to the query.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
