I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It discusses the use of multiple-instance learning algorithms, specifically MTMI-SMF, for detecting invasive plant species using hyperspectral and multispectral imagery. However, it does not provide information on the type of deep learning model used, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
