Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper or report discussing the utilization of available well data, feature selection, and the potential of machine learning algorithms to improve understanding and decision-making outcomes.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of majority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation of underrepresented groups.

Please note that these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, and I'm providing general information on common techniques used to address data bias. If you're looking for specific information related to the context, I would recommend checking the original source or providing more context.
