Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of hidden Markov models for behavioral segmentation of animal movement paths, the estimation of model parameters in Bayesian and frequentist frameworks, and the potential use of multiple machine learning algorithms and their ensembles. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
