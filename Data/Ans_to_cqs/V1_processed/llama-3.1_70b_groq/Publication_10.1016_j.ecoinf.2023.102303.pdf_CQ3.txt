The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. It only mentions that the dataset was "quickly and weakly labeled" to create the first weakly-supervised fish dataset in turbid waters. The term "weakly labeled" suggests that the annotation process may not have involved detailed annotations such as bounding boxes or instance segmentation, but rather a more general labeling of the data. However, the exact annotation technique used is not specified.
