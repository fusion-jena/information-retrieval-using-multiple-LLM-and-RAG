The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used for other models, such as Random Forests (RFs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and Generalized Boosting Models (GBMs). 

The metrics mentioned in the context are:

1. Percent Bias (pbias): calculated as 100 × (tobs - tpred) / tobs, where tobs and tpred are observed and predicted temperatures, respectively.
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): calculated as 1/n ∑ |tobs - tpred|, where n is the number of weather stations.
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): calculated as √(1/n ∑ (tobs - tpred)^2), where n is the number of weather stations.
4. Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) score: not explicitly defined in the provided context, but mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the models.

It is not clear if these metrics are also used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, as the context does not provide specific information about the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models.
