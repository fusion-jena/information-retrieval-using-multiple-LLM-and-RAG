The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained with a maximum of 10,000 iterations and a training error of 0.001. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored through the tracking of the training error, and the training process was stopped when the error reached the specified threshold or the maximum number of iterations was reached.
