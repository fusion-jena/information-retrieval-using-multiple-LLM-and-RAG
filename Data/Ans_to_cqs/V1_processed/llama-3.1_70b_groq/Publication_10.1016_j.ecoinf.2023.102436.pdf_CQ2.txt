The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the research focuses on landscape photographs and 3D spatial metrics. 

In the context of landscape photographs, it is likely that image data formats such as JPEG or TIFF are used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of 3D models created in visualization tools like Rhino, Sketchup, and 3D Max, which may involve data formats such as OBJ, STL, or FBX. 

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context does not mention audio or video data formats, and CSV is not explicitly mentioned either.
