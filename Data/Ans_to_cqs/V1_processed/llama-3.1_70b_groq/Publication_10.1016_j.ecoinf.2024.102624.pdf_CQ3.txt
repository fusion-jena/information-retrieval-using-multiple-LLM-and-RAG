Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the classification of plant populations using remote sensing data and discusses various strategies to improve classification accuracy, including training data augmentation, post-classification techniques, and hyperparameter tuning. However, it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
