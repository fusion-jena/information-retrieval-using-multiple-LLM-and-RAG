I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to datasets in the context of data repositories, data studies, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about datasets used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
