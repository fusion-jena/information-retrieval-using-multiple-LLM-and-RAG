The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely involves image data. 

The context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks such as image classification, image segmentation, and face recognition. It also mentions the use of camera traps and uncontrolled video recordings for monitoring and species identification, which suggests that visual data is being used. 

Additionally, the context references research papers related to image recognition, object detection, and image classification, further supporting the idea that image data is being used in the pipeline. 

However, it is not possible to confirm whether other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
