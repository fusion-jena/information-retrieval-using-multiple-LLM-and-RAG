Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of accuracy assessment using GMEP data, as illustrated in Figure 5. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics such as Producer's accuracy, User's accuracy, and Overall accuracy, as shown in Table 4. Additionally, the context mentions the use of error matrices to identify commission and omission errors, which can help in monitoring the model performance. However, the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
