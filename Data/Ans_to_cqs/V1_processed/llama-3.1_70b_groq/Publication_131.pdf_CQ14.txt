Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only provides information about the structure of the CNN, the number of filters per convolution layer, kernel size, and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. It also mentions the training and testing strategy, but it does not discuss hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
