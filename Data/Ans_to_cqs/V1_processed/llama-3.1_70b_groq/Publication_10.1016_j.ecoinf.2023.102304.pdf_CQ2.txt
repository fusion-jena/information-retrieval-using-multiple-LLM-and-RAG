I don't know. The provided context does not mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be related to remote sensing and land cover classification, discussing various indices such as NDVI, EVI, and NBR, as well as spectral bands and land cover types. However, it does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
