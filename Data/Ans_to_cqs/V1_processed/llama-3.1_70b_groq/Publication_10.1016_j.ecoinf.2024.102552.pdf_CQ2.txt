The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of imagery, specifically NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery, which suggests that image data is used in the classification process. Additionally, the context mentions the use of spectral information and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which implies that the image data may be in a format that supports multi-band or spectral information, such as GeoTIFF or similar formats. However, the exact data formats used in the pipeline are not specified.
