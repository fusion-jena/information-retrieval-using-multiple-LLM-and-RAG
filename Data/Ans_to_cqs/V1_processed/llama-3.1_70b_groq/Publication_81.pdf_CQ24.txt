Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in biological networks, fish classification using DNA barcode sequences, and the use of Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in the ESK model.

However, it does mention the use of Random Forest supervised learning model in one of the references (BMC Genet. 2019, 20, 2), but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
