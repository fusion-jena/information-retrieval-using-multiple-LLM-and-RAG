Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on using footprints to estimate tiger populations, and it discusses the use of a method called FIT (Footprint Identification Technique) for this purpose. It mentions data validation, holdback trial partitioning tests, and the importance of having a robust and statistically valid approach, but it does not mention techniques like Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
