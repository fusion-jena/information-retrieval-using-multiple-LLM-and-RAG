According to the provided context, the dataset was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process. This suggests that the researchers used a form of stratified splitting to ensure that the model was trained and validated on separate subsets of the data.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, which is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data by training and testing it on multiple folds of the data.

Regarding the diversity of the dataset, the context mentions that the dataset was a "targeted fish species dataset", but it does not provide further information on the diversity of the dataset or whether it was collected from multiple sources or environments.

Therefore, while the researchers took some measures to ensure the generalizability of the model by splitting the data into training and validation sets, it is unclear whether they used other techniques such as cross-validation or ensured that the dataset was diverse and representative of the problem domain.
