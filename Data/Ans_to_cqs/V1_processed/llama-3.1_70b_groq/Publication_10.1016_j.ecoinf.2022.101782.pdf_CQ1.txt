The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study leverages citizen science data and social media posts to extract relevant records. 

According to the context, the workflow uses citizen science data documenting and recording sightings of birds, specifically red kites (Milvus milvus), and social media data from platforms like Flickr. The context also mentions that the workflow uses textual metadata and image content to identify further relevant sightings in the social media dataset.

Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this study appear to be:

1. Citizen science data: This involves collecting data from citizen scientists who document and record sightings of birds.
2. Social media posts: The study collects social media posts from platforms like Flickr, which include textual metadata and image content.

It is not clear if other methods like surveys or sensors are used for collecting raw data in this study.
