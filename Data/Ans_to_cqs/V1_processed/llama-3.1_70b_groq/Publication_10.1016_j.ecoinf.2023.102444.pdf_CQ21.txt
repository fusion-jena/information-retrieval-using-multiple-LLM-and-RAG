After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved include the calculation of various metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. Specifically, the following metrics were calculated:

1. Nearest neighbor Euclidean distance between species-species (Dss) and background-species (Dsb).
2. Pss, the cumulative empirical distribution function of the intra-species distance Dss.
3. S = (1- Pss) for the distances between the background and species.
4. Mutual information coefficient (MIC) to measure the amount of information shared by each pair of variables.
5. Area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the performance of UMAP as a binary classifier.
6. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to evaluate the performance of UMAP as a binary classifier.
7. Kappa index (K) to evaluate the performance of UMAP as a binary classifier.
8. Point-biserial correlation (COR) index to evaluate the performance of UMAP as a binary classifier.

Additionally, the model's performance was visualized using plots such as Fig. 8A and Fig. 8B, which show the departure from random prediction, and Fig. 9, which shows the relative importance of the bioclimatic variables as related to latent distance.
