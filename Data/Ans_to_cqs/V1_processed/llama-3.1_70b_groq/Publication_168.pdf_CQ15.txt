The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, is the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. This algorithm is used to optimize the model weights by minimizing the cross-entropy cost function. The cross-entropy cost function is defined as J = - (1/m) * âˆ‘[y_i * log(y_i) + (1-y_i) * log(1-y_i)], where y_i is the true label and y_i is the predicted probability. The SGD algorithm is used to update the model weights by iteratively minimizing the cross-entropy loss. There is no mention of other optimization techniques like Adam in the provided context.
