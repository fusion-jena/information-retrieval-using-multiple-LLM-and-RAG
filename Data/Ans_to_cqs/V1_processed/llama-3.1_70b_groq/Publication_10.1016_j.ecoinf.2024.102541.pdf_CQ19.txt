Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses the architecture and components of the YOLOv5s model, such as the CSPDarknet53 backbone and the MobileNetV2 structure, but it does not specify the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
