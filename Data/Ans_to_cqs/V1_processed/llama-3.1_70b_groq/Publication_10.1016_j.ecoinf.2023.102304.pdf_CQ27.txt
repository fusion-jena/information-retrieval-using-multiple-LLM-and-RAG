I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be related to the optimization of a model for detecting forest disturbances, specifically the use of the LTR (LandTrendr) algorithm and the evaluation of its accuracy. There is no mention of model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.
