The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model, specifically a variant of the U2-Net architecture. The text mentions that "For SOD applications, conventional CNN-based networks often fail in extracting global information from shallow layers..." and "We employ U2-Net (Qin et al., 2020) as our base network." This indicates that the model is built on top of a CNN architecture, with the U2-Net being a specific type of CNN designed for salient object detection (SOD) tasks.
