To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset of 64 water samples from the Erhai watershed, which includes samples from different geographical locations and trophic states. This diversity in the dataset helps to ensure that the model can generalize well to different types of water bodies.

Secondly, the dataset was split into two parts: one for model calibration and the other for validation. This splitting of the dataset helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data.

Lastly, the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI values. This evaluation helps to ensure that the model is accurately predicting the TSI values and can be generalized to other similar datasets.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used in the study. Therefore, I do not know if these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
