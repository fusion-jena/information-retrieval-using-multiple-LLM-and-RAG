Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, as well as the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

However, it can be inferred that the study employed a robust evaluation methodology, including the use of two primary metrics, Overall Accuracy (OA) and Cohen's Kappa statistic, to assess the model's effectiveness. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a large number of estimators (n_estimators) and a range of hyperparameter values, which could indicate an attempt to ensure the model's generalizability.

But, without explicit information on the dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
