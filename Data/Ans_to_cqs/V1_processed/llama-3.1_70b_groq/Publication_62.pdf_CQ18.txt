The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that "Validation: PBF & RBD" in the author contributions section, which suggests that Paul B. Frandsen and RBD were involved in validating the model. Additionally, the supplementary materials include notebooks used to define and train the CNN models, which may contain information about the validation process. However, without further information, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not clear.
