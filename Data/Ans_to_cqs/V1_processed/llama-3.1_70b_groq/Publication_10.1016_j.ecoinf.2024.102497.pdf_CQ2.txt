I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of remote sensing data, specifically GF-6 (WFV) data, for bathymetry retrieval in the Yellow River Delta-Laizhou Bay, China. The context mentions the preprocessing of the remote sensing data, including radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
