The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are listed in Table 2 of the provided context. The optimal values for the three different regression tasks are displayed in the right-most three columns. 

The hyperparameters and their optimal values are as follows:

* Number of neurons in the first layer: 100 (SOS), 70 (POS), 100 (PEAK)
* Number of neurons in the second layer: 0 (SOS), 0 (POS), 30 (PEAK)
* Strength of the L2 regularization term: 0.0290 (SOS), 0.0010 (POS), 0.0606 (PEAK)
* Solver for weight optimization: adam (all three tasks)
* Initial learning rate: Not explicitly stated, but the learning rate schedule for weight updates is mentioned.
* Maximum number of iterations: Not explicitly stated, but the maximum number of iterations with no improvement is mentioned.

Note that the learning rate is not explicitly stated in the provided context, but it is mentioned that the learning rate schedule for weight updates is used.
