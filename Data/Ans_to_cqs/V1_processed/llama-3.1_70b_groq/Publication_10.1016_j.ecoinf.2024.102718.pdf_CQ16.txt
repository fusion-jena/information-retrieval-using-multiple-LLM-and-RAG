The criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation accuracy and validation loss plateau. Specifically, the model employs various callbacks, such as ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint, and EarlyStopping, which dynamically modify the learning rate while preserving the optimal model iteration according to the validation accuracy. These callbacks are used to monitor the model's performance on the validation dataset during training and adjust the learning rate or stop training when the model's performance plateaus or degrades.
