The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to systematically record the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values at each iteration. This is done during the 10,000 iterations of the training process. The goal of this systematic recording is to pinpoint the hyper-parameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the calculations.
