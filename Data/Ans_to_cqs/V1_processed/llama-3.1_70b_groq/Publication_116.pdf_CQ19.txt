The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention "Caffe: Convolutional architecture for fast feature embedding" in reference [34], which suggests that Caffe might be one of the frameworks used. Additionally, the context does not provide enough information to confirm the use of other frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
