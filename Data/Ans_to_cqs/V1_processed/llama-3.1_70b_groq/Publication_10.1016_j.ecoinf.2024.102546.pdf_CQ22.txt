The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the current evaluation metrics focus on image fidelity and reality, which contribute to the assessment of image generation by diffusion models (Kynk√§anniemi et al., 2019). Additionally, it mentions that human evaluation protocols, such as side-by-side image comparison (Wang et al., 2023), can be used to measure domain gaps.

In the context of weed detection, the paper mentions that the accuracy of the models is evaluated, but it does not provide a detailed list of metrics used. Figure 7 shows the weed detection accuracies of YOLOX and YOLOv8 with and without I3Net-based domain adaptation, but it does not specify the exact metrics used to calculate accuracy.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, I do not know the exact list of metrics used, such as precision, recall, or F1-score.
