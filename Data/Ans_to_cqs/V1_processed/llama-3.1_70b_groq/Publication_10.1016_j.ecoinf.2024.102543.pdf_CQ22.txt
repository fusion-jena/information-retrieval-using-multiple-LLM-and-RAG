The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model mentioned in the context are:

1. Precision (Prec.)
2. Mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU 0.5 (mAP0.5) and IoU 0.95 (mAP0.95)
3. Parameters (Params) or the number of learned variables used for making predictions
4. Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPs)
5. Inference time (Inf.) in milliseconds (ms)
6. Time taken for training in hours

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's accuracy, computational efficiency, and speed. The mAP is the primary evaluation index used to measure network detection performance, which considers both precision and recall. The Params and FLOPs metrics are used to evaluate the model's complexity and computational efficiency. The inference time and time taken for training are used to evaluate the model's speed and training efficiency.
