Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning models (MLMs) for forest fire dynamics, the performance evaluation of these models, and some general information about the manuscript, such as funding and declarations. However, it does not provide any details about the deployment process of the trained model, including model serialization or platform selection.
