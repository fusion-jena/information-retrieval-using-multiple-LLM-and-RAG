Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context mentions the use of a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks) to create a high-resolution CHM of the Earth, but it does not provide details on the data splitting process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
