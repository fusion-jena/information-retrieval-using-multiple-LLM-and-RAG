Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the evaluation metrics used, such as Mean IoU (MIoU) and Overall Accuracy, and the training process of the SoftGroup architecture, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques employed, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
