I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting mosquito abundances, but it does not provide any information on a data repository link. The references cited are mostly academic papers and MATLAB documentation, but there is no mention of a data repository link.
