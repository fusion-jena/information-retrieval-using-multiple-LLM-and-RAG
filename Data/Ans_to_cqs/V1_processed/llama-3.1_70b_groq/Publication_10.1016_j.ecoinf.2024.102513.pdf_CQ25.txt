The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification. The model is designed to accurately identify various land cover forms based on their spectral signatures, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The model takes in a stack of raster bands from satellite images as input, processes the spectral information, and outputs a spatial map of land use and land cover, where each pixel is classified into a specific LULC class.
