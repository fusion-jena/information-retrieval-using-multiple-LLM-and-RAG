Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and training of various models, including Model-K and Model-2, but does not provide information on data preprocessing.

However, it does mention that the models were initialized with pre-trained weights based on the Imagenet dataset, which suggests that the data may have been preprocessed in some way before being used to train the models. Additionally, the context mentions the use of batch normalization in the contracting path of the proposed model, which is a type of normalization technique.

But without more information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the question of what preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model.
