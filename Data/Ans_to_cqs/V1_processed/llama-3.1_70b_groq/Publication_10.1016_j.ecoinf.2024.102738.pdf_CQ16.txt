Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on land use and land cover (LULC) classification, fragmentation analysis, and accuracy assessment, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
