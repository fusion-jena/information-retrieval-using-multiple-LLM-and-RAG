Based on the provided context, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the models mentioned are:

1. Unet (U-Net): a CNN architecture that uses an encoder-decoder structure with shortcut connections.
2. Deeplabv3+: a CNN architecture that uses an encoder-decoder framework with an asymmetric spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module.
3. Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (Pspnet): a CNN architecture that uses a spatial pyramid module to gather contextual data.

These models are all variants of CNNs, which are commonly used for image segmentation and classification tasks. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
