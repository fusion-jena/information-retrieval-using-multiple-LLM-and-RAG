I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments and quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires, but it does not provide details on the specific architecture or type of model used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
