Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the application of machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and support vector machines, to classify animal behavior based on acceleration (ACC) data. It also touches on the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.

However, it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are typically involved in preparing data for training a deep learning model. These steps are crucial in ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for the model to learn from, but the context does not provide any information on this topic.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
