Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context appears to be a list of research papers related to environmental and ecological topics, but it does not provide information about the architecture of the deep learning model used in any of the studies. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
