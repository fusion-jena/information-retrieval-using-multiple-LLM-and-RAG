The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation (DA) as a technique used to quantitatively increase and diversify training data, which can help alleviate data bias. 

Data augmentation is a technique in which the training set is artificially increased by creating modified copies of a dataset using the existing data. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the network. However, it does not specifically address data bias.

The context also mentions dividing data into five equal folds, which could be related to techniques like stratified splitting. However, it is not explicitly stated as a method for addressing data bias.

Other techniques like oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only technique that can be inferred as related to addressing data bias is data augmentation. However, it is not explicitly stated as a method for addressing data bias.
