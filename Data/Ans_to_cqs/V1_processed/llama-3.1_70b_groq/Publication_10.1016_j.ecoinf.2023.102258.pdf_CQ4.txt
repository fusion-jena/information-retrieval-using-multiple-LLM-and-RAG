Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that "simple improvements over the baselines were achieved by applying data augmentation techniques" but does not provide further details on the specific techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
