Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily focuses on the adaptation of Vision Transformer (ViT) models for birdsong classification, data augmentation strategies, and the performance of different models. It does not provide information on data splitting or partitioning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
