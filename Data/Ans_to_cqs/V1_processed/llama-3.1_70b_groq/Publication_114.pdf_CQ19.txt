The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions various deep learning architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these architectures. Therefore, I do not know which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning model.
