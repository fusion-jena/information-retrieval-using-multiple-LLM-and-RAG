The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study used satellite images from Google Earth Engine (GEE) to extract information about spectral indices, including NDVI data. Additionally, it mentions that the study used a Code Editor tool to extract 97 images from April 2013 to July 2021, and that the final dataset included the mean NDVI score, month date stamp, and forest vulnerability as the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline likely include image data (satellite images) and possibly CSV or other tabular data formats to store the extracted NDVI data and other relevant information. However, without more explicit information, it is not possible to confirm the specific data formats used.
