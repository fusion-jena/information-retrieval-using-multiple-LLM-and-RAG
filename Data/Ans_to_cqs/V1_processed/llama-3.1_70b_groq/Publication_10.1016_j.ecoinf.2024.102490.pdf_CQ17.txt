The provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some machine learning algorithms and techniques, such as Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and Regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent (Friedman et al., 2010).

The context also mentions the use of regularization in the context of generalized linear models, specifically the use of coordinate descent for regularization paths (Friedman et al., 2010). However, it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline.
