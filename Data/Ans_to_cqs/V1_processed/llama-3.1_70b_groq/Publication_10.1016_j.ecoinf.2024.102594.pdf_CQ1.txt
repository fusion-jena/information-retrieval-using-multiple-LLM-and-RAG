Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the DeepLabV3+ model training process, data preprocessing, and the structure of the DeepLabV3+ algorithm. It mentions the use of remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes, but it does not provide information on how these data were collected.

However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that the data might have been collected using remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or aerial imagery, as mentioned in the references (e.g., Berra, E.F., Gaulton, R., Barr, S., 2019; Buchsteiner, C., Baur, P.A., Glatzel, S., 2023). Nevertheless, without more explicit information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to this question.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
