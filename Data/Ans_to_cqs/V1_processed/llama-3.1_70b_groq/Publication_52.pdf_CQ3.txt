Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Deep Extreme Learning (DELE) methods for handling and analyzing Big Data, as well as their applications in object recognition, speech recognition, and audio classification.

However, it does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object recognition tasks, which often require data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. But the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
