The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's training loss against the learning rate was monitored to determine the appropriate learning rate. This is evident from Fig. 11, which shows the model's training loss against the learning rate. The learning rate was fixed at the point where the plot started dipping, which was at 10^-4. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored by tracking the training loss and adjusting the learning rate accordingly.
