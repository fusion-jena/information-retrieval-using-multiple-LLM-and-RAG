I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a marine conservation project, specifically a monitoring program that uses a mobile app to collect data on marine taxa. The text discusses the app's features, data collection methods, and potential biases, but does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
