Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context only discusses the evaluation methodology, specifically the use of folded cross-validation, and mentions that the performance metrics are recorded and compared to a benchmark model. It also mentions that the disparities in key metrics are evidenced through quantitative values and data visualizations.

However, it does not provide specific details on the postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
