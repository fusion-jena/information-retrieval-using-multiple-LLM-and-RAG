Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the development of deep learning methodologies for underwater fish video processing in turbid waters, the creation of a weakly labeled public FishInTurbidWater dataset, and the proposal of two novel deep learning models. It also provides some information about the performance of these models, including their accuracy and turnaround time.

However, it does not provide details on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I do not know the specific criteria used for data splitting in this context.
