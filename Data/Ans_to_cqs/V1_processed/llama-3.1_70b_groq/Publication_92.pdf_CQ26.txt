To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the techniques used in this context include data augmentation and diverse data collection. 

Data augmentation is achieved by applying rotations and symmetries to the existing images in the database. This helps to capture all possible positions of the fishes, thereby increasing the diversity of the data and reducing bias.

Diverse data collection is also employed by working with biology experts of the MARBEC laboratory to label many videos. This ensures that the data collected is diverse and representative of different species.

Additionally, the database is widened by adding a class for the background, which includes random thumbnails of the background and specific background thumbnails taken around the fish thumbnails. This helps to reduce bias towards a specific type of background.

However, it is not mentioned in the provided context whether techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are used to address data bias.
