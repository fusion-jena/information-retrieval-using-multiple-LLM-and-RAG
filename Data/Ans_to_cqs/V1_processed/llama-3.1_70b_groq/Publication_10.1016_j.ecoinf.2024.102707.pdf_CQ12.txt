Based on the provided context, it appears that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in some of the pipelines mentioned. For example, Le, Samaras, and Lynch (2022) designed a CNN architecture for the automated survey of seabird colonies. Additionally, Peng et al. (2020) used a modified Faster R-CNN for kiang detection in Tibetan plateau. However, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in every pipeline mentioned in the context, as not all papers may have specified this information.
