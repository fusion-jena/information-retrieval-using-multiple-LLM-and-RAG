Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of object detection models, specifically YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and their variants, as well as the application of these models for detecting Pacific oysters. It does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
