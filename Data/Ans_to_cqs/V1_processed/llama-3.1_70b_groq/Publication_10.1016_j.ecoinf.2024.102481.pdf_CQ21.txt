According to the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of various metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.

Specifically, the model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Cohen's kappa coefficient (Îº) to measure the proportion of agreements.
2. Precision to determine the proportion of correct predictions.
3. Sensitivity for the true positive rate (correctly predicted phases).
4. Specificity for the true negative rate (correct allocation to other phases).
5. Prevalence for the proportion within each phase.

Additionally, a confusion matrix was used to evaluate the model performance, which includes the following metrics:

* True Positives (TP)
* True Negatives (TN)
* False Positives (FP)
* False Negatives (FN)

These metrics were used to calculate the performance indicators for the random forest classification of maturity condition in Chilean hake, as shown in Table 2.

There is no mention of Saliency maps in the provided context.
