The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is species identification based on audio recordings. Specifically, it is used for automating data acquisition, data management, and species identification in the Automated Remote Biodiversity Monitoring Network (ARBIMON) platform. The model works with one or two regions of interest (ROIs) and training data to identify the presence or absence of a specific vocalization. 

In the context of the provided papers, the deep learning model is used for classification tasks, such as identifying bird species from audio recordings. For example, Kahl et al. (2021) present a deep learning solution called BirdNET for avian diversity monitoring, which is likely used for classification tasks. Similarly, Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) discuss the use of deep neural networks for species distribution modeling, which also involves classification tasks. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does not provide information on the specific architecture or type of deep learning model used, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are commonly used for image or audio classification tasks.
