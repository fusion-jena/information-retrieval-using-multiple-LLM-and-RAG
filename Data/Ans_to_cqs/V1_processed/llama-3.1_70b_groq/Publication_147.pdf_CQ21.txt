Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of training time, prediction time, and optimization time for different models (CNN and XGB), as well as the input variables used in these models.

However, it does mention that the model was trained for 110 epochs and that the training and prediction took approximately 3-4 hours. Additionally, it provides information on the hardware used for training and prediction, but it does not provide details on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
