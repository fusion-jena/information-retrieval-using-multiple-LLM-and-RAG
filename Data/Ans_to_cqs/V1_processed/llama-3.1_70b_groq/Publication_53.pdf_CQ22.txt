The provided context mentions the following metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model:

1. Error rate: The initial model achieved an error rate of 11.95%, which was later improved to 5.2% after fine-tuning the model.
2. Accuracy: The final model achieved an accuracy of 94.8%.
3. Training loss and validation loss: The model's performance was also evaluated using the training loss and validation loss, which were 0.3462 and 0.2847 for the initial model, and 0.1397 and 0.1446 for the final model, respectively.

However, the context does not mention precision and recall explicitly. It does mention the use of a confusion matrix (Figure S1) to evaluate the model's performance, which typically includes metrics such as precision and recall. But the actual values of precision and recall are not provided in the given context.
