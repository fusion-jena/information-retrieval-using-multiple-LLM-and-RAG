The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated from predicted multi-labels for the overlapped bird calls audio from the test dataset. Additionally, accuracy is also mentioned as a metric used in a previous study, where the authors achieved an accuracy of 89.61% and 91.49% respectively. However, accuracy is not explicitly mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the proposed Wav2Vec model.
