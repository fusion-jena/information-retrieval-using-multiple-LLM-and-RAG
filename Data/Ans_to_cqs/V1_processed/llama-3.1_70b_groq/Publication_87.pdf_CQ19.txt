PyTorch is used to build the deep learning model. This is evident from the provided context, which mentions "PyTorch: An Imperative Style, High-Performance Deep Learning Library" in the references. Additionally, the code snippet provided uses a resnet18 architecture, which is a common deep learning model architecture, and the code is written in R, but it is likely using PyTorch under the hood through the reticulate package, which is an R interface to Python.
