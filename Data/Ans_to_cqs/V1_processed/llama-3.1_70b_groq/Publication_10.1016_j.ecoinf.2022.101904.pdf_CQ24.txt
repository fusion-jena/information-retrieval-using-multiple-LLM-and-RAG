Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the 3DUNetGSFormer model, its architecture, and its application to wetland mapping, as well as the results of the proposed model compared to other models.

However, it does mention the use of a random noise vector in the conditional map unit of the 3D GAN network to produce synthetic samples for classes with a low number of training samples. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data generation process, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the overall deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
