Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation in aquaculture, highlighting the importance of high-quality images and automated processing methods.

However, it can be inferred that preprocessing steps are necessary to prepare the data for training a deep learning model. The context mentions the use of computer vision and deep learning techniques, which typically require preprocessing steps such as image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

The context also mentions the use of the Haar classifier, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that requires feature extraction and preprocessing. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, while we can infer that some preprocessing steps are likely involved, the exact steps are not specified in the provided context.
