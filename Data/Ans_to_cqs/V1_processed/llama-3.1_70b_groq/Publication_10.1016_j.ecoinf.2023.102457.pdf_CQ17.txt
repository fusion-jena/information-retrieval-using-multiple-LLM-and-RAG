Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of pre-trained CNNs, such as VGGish and BirdNET, and the extraction of embeddings from audio data, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
