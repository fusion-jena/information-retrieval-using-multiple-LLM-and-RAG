Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery: Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) used UAS imagery for wetlands classification.
2. Airborne LiDAR data: Marasigan et al. (2019) used airborne LiDAR data for mangrove crown diameter measurement, while You et al. (2018) used it for coniferous forest structural parameters estimation.
3. LiDAR sensor mounted on a UAV: Yin and Wang (2019) used a LiDAR sensor mounted on a UAV to collect high-density (HD) LiDAR data for individual mangrove tree measurement.
4. Ground-based LiDAR data: Jin et al. (2018) used ground-based LiDAR data for individual plant segmentation in maize plots, while Wang et al. (2019a) used it for individual rubber tree segmentation.

These methods suggest that remote sensing technologies, such as LiDAR and UAS imagery, are commonly used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for environmental and ecological applications. However, it is not clear if surveys or public datasets are used in these specific studies.
