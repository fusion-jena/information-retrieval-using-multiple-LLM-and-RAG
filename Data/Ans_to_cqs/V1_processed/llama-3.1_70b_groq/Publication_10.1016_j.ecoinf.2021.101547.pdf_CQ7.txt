Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the importance of selecting a suitable mini-batch size, the challenges of using deep learning, and the process of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The specific criteria for splitting the data, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set, may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.

In the absence of explicit information in the provided context, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer to this question.
