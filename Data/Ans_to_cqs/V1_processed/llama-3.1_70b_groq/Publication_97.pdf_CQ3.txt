The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the problem of forest damage identification is a semantic segmentation problem, which involves pixel-wise classification. This suggests that the data annotation technique used is likely instance segmentation, where each pixel in the image is annotated with a class label.

Additionally, the context mentions that the network training assessment was performed on sub-images generated from image #2 (Table 1), and that images #4 and #6 were used for visualization and demonstration of the algorithm efficacy. This implies that the data annotation technique used may involve annotating the images with masks or labels that correspond to the different classes of forest damage.

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to say for certain what specific data annotation techniques were used. The context does not mention bounding box annotation, but it does mention that the network was trained on sub-images of size 256x256, which may suggest that the annotation technique used was focused on pixel-level classification rather than object-level annotation.
