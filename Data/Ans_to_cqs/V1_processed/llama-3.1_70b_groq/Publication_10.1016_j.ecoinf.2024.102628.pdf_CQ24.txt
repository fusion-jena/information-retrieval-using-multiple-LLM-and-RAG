I don't know. The provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning techniques to LiDAR data in the context of forest ecology, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used to handle randomness in the pipeline.
