The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Precision: This metric is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.
2. Recall: This metric is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
3. F1-score (F1): This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being a perfect classifier.
4. Macro-F1: This metric is the F1-score calculated at the macro level, where all classes are weighted equally.
5. Micro-F1: This metric is the F1-score calculated at the micro level, where all classes are weighted according to their proportion in the dataset.
6. Top-1 accuracy: This metric is equivalent to micro-recall and represents the overall accuracy of the model.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model at both the micro and macro levels, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.
