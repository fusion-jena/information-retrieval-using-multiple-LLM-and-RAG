The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the optimization method for neural network (NN) parameters Î¸ is based on stochastic gradient descent algorithms, and the loss function gradient is approximated by the back-propagation algorithm.

It also mentions that the performance metrics are calculated for each species and for two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites: a train set (4781 sites) and a test set (400 sites). The performance metrics are then averaged over the 50 species.

While it does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it does mention that the learning rate can be raised leading to a quicker convergence, suggesting that convergence may be one of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is not explicitly stated, and it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
