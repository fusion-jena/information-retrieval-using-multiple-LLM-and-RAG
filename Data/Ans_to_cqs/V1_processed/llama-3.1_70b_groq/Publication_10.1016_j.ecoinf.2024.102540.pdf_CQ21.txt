Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training process, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics of the detection models, as well as the development of a web application for alate detection on sorghum leaves.

However, it does mention that the trained models were evaluated using certain metrics, but it does not provide details on the specific metrics used or how they were calculated. Additionally, the context mentions that the web application allows users to upload images of sorghum leaves, which are then processed by the model, but it does not provide information on any postprocessing steps that may occur after the model's output.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
