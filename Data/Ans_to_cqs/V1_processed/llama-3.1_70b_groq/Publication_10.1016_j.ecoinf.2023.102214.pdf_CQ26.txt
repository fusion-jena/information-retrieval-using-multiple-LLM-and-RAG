The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques, specifically left-right mirroring, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs and inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. This suggests that the researchers were aware of the potential for overfitting and took steps to mitigate it, but it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, beyond the use of left-right mirroring data augmentation.
