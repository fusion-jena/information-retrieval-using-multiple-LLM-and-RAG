Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning techniques in ecology, specifically in areas such as streamflow forecasting, air quality prediction, and biomonitoring. The mentioned studies and papers seem to use domain-specific datasets, but the exact names of the datasets are not provided. Therefore, I don't know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
