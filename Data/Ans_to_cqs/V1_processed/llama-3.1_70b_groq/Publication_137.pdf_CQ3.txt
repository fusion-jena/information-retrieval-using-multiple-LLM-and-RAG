The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the pipeline of the framework, which includes computing the geometric partition, converting each geometric partition into a superpoint, inputting the superpoints into a PointNet network for super-point embedding, and segmenting the point clouds based on context with a graph convolution network.

The context also mentions that the results of geometric partition have a great impact on the semantic segmentation due to different superpoints caused by varying partition results. This suggests that the framework may use some form of segmentation or partitioning as a form of annotation, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
