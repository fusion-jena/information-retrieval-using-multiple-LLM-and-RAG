Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from research papers related to machine learning, remote sensing, and land use classification, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it's worth noting that the context mentions the use of scikit-learn and scikit-image libraries, which are popular Python libraries for machine learning and image processing, respectively. These libraries do provide tools for data augmentation, but the specific techniques used in the context are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
