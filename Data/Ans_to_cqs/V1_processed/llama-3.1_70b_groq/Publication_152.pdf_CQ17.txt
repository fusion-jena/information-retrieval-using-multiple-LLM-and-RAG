The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and semi-supervised deep convolutional networks.

One of the references mentioned, [27] D. P. Kingma and J. Ba, "Adam: A method for stochastic optimization," arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6980, 2014, is related to optimization methods, but it does not specifically discuss regularization methods.

Another reference, [26] R. Takahashi, T. Matsubara, and K. Uehara, "Ricap: Random image cropping and patching data augmentation for deep cnns," in Asian Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2018, pp. 786-798, discusses data augmentation methods, which can help prevent overfitting, but it does not mention specific regularization methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
