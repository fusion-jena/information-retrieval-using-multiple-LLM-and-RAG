The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation. This approach maximizes the use of available data, reduces bias in performance estimation, and is particularly useful for small datasets. It rigorously assesses model performance by iterative training on all but one sample and evaluating the excluded sample. Additionally, the performance metrics calculated include the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE).
