Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training data, and feature extraction techniques used in the BirdNET model.

However, it does mention that the authors calculated the mean and standard deviation of the embeddings over the entire duration of the call, resulting in a feature vector. Additionally, the context mentions that the authors evaluated the performance of the different feature types using metrics such as classification accuracy (Fig. 4) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) for clustering (Fig. 5).

But, it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
