Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the performance of different models, including ResNeSt101 + SCAM and ResNeSt50 + SCAM, and their evaluation using various metrics, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
