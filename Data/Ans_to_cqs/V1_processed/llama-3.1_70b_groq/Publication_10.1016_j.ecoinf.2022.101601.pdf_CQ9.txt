I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research-related information, including references to studies on permafrost, thaw depth, and Bayesian networks. There is no mention of a data repository or a specific platform such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
