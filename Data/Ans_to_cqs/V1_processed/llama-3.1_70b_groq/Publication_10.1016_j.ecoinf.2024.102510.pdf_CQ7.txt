The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are the proportions of the dataset allocated to the training set, validation set, and testing set. According to the provided context, three data split strategies were employed: 60:40, 80:20, and 90:10. This means that the dataset was split into a training set and a validation set using these proportions. For example, in the 60:40 split, 60% of the data was used for training and 40% for validation. Similarly, in the 80:20 split, 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for validation, and in the 90:10 split, 90% of the data was used for training and 10% for validation.
