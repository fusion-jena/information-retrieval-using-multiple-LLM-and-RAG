Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the architecture of a neural network, including the input layer, hidden layers, and activation functions, as well as hyperparameter optimization methods. It also references various studies and papers related to deep learning and neural networks, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
