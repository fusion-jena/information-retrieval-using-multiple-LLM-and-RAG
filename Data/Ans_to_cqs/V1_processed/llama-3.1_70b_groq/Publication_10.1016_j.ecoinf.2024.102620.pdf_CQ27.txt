I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to be a research paper discussing the PLUS model, a land use change modeling approach that uses a random forest algorithm and cellular automata. The context also includes references to other research papers and a master's thesis, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model.
