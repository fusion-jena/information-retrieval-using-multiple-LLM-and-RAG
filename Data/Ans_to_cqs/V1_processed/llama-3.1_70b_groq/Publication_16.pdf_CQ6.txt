The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that data pre-processing is done using the Librosa library, and Figure 8 shows the data pre-processing stages.

According to Figure 8, the preprocessing steps involved are:

1. Audio file segmentation into 15-second windows.
2. Feature extraction using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).

No other preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are mentioned in the provided context.
