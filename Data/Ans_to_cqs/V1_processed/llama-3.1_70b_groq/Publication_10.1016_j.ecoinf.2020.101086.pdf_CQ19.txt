I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to species distribution models (SDMs) and the challenges of building unbiased models with limited data. It mentions a research paper by Wisz et al. (2008) on the effects of sample size on the performance of SDMs, but it does not provide information on deep learning frameworks.
