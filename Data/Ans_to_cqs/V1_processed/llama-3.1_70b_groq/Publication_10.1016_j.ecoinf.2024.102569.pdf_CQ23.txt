The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, which suggests that some form of evaluation or validation was performed. Additionally, the context mentions the removal of heterogeneous observations, which could be seen as a form of data preprocessing to improve the model's performance. However, it does not provide information on the use of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability.
