The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the 20 m bands of the imagery were resampled to 10 m in order to harmonize all band data and ensure that the classification of images was adjusted to this resolution. This suggests that some form of data preprocessing, specifically resampling, was performed to prepare the data for the Random Forest (RF) machine learning technique used for image classification.
