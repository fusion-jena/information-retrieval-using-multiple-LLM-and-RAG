Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of extreme deep learning in biosecurity, specifically for marine species identification, and discusses the use of algorithms such as GRELMA and autoencoders. It also mentions the potential of extreme learning machines (ELMs) for handling and analyzing big data.

However, it does mention "OL data streams" and "geolocation-based services" which could be related to data collection methods. OL data streams might refer to online data streams, but the context does not provide further information on how these data streams are collected. Geolocation-based services might involve collecting data from sensors or other devices that provide location information, but again, the context does not provide specific details.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
