Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture and components of the model, such as the use of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and attention mechanisms, but does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
