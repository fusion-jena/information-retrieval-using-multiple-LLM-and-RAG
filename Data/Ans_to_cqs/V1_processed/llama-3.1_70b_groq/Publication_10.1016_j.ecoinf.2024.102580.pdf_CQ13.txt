Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions the object queries parameter of the DETR model, which was set to 100, allowing for the detection of up to 100 turtles in an image. Additionally, it mentions that the colour channel means and standard deviations were based on the ImageNet dataset used in the training of the (pre-trained) RestNet-50. However, it does not provide information on other hyperparameters like learning rate and optimizer.
