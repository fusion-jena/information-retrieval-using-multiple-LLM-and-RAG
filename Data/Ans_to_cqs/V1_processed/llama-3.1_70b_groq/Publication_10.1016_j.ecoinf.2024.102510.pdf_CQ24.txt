Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization Scheme (HHOS) and its application in optimizing hyperparameters for a deep learning model. It discusses the limitations and benefits of the HHOS approach but does not delve into specific strategies for handling randomness.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of random search as part of the HHOS approach, which involves iteratively sampling various combinations of hyperparameter values. This implies that randomness is an inherent part of the optimization process. Nevertheless, the context does not provide information on how randomness is specifically handled or controlled in the pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
