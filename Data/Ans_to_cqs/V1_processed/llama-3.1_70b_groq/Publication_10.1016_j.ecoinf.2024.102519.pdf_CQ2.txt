The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or the specific data formats used in such a pipeline. However, based on the data sources and characteristics listed in Table 1, it appears that the data formats used in this study are primarily raster and vector data, as well as statistical data from yearbooks. The raster data includes DEM, land use, NDVI, soil data, population, GDP, and meteorological data, all of which are in raster format with varying spatial resolutions. The vector data is mentioned but not described in detail. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats, and CSV is not explicitly mentioned either.
