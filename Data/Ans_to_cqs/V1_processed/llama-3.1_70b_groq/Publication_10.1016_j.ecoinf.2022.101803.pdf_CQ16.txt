The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the performance on the validation set is monitored by calculating the out-of-sample prediction accuracy and taking the median of k-1 folds. This suggests that the training process may be stopped when the performance on the validation set stops improving or reaches a certain threshold, but the exact criteria are not specified.
