I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training completion criteria, validation loss plateau, or any related concepts. The context appears to be discussing synthetic data utility/validation measures, data quality scores, and a decision support tool for ecological modeling. It does not provide any information about the training process or its completion criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
