Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the use of transformers in natural language processing and computer vision, particularly in remote sensing applications. It discusses the performance of various transformer-based models, including the Swin Transformer, and their comparison with CNN-based models.

However, it does mention the use of synthetic data and GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) in conjunction with the Swin Transformer, which could be related to data augmentation. But it does not provide specific details on the techniques used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
