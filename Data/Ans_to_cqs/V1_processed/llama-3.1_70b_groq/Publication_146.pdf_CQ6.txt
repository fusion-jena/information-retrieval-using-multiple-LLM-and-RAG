Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. It discusses the choice of optimizer, hyperparameter settings, and training details, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
