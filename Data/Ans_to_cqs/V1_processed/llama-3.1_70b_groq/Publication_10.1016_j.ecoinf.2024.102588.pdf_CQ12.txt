The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, a one-dimensional CNN is adopted due to the nature of the input data. The CNN model is used in conjunction with an autoencoder, where the manifold features of the autoencoder are utilized as inputs for the CNN model.
