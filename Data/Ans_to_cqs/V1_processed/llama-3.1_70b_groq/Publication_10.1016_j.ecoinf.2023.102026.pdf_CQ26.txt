The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention resampling techniques, such as bootstrapping (i.e., random subsampling with replacement), which can be used to increase models' precision by reducing stochastic errors in estimation.

Additionally, the context mentions random forest (RF) as a machine learning technique that can handle large numbers of predictor variables without being affected by multicollinearity, and can readily accommodate nonlinear relationships between predictor and response variables. However, it does not explicitly discuss how RF addresses data bias.

The context also mentions scaling hypotheses and spatial scales (e.g., 1000 m, 2000 m, 4000 m, 6000 m, 8000 m, and 10,000 m), but it does not provide information on how these relate to addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, I can suggest that bootstrapping is a resampling technique that can be used to increase models' precision, but I do not know if it is specifically used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
