I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental research, with references to papers on topics such as desertification, drought, climate change, and ecological engineering. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning models, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
