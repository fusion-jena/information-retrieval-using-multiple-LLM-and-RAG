The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model was trained using thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species, and environment, and that the training dataset T4 was created by splitting thumbnails from each species into 20 classes "part of species". This could be interpreted as a form of data augmentation, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained using at least 2200 thumbnails per fish species class, which could be seen as a form of oversampling or ensuring that each class has a sufficient number of samples. However, this is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained using a diverse set of images, including whole fish, part of fish species, and environment, and that each class had a sufficient number of samples.
