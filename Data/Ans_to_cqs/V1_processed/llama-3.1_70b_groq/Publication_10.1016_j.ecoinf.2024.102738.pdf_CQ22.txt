The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Index (KI). These coefficients are necessary for the evaluation of classification accuracy. The Overall Accuracy (OA) is calculated as the total number of pixels classified correctly divided by the total number of pixels, multiplied by 100. The Kappa Index (KI) is calculated using a confusion matrix, which takes into account the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives. The equations for calculating OA and KI are provided in the context as Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively.
