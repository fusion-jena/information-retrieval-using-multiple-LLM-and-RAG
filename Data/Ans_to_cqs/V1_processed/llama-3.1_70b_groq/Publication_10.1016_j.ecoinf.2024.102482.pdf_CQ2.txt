Based on the provided context, it appears that various data formats are used in deep learning pipelines for ecological applications. 

Image data is used in some cases, such as in the paper "BivalveNet: a hybrid deep neural network for common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) geographical traceability based on shell image analysis" by Concepcion et al. (2023), where shell images are analyzed for geographical traceability.

Audio data is also used, as mentioned in the context, for example, in the vocalization detection of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (Padovese et al., 2023) and bird vocalization recognition (Xie et al., 2023).

There is no mention of video data being used in the provided context.

CSV (Comma Separated Values) data format is likely used, as many of the papers mention using data collected over an extended period, which is often stored in CSV format. For example, Mortezavi et al. (2023) use hourly short-term streamflow forecasting data, which is likely stored in a CSV format.

Additionally, time-series data is also used, as seen in the paper "Dynamic graph convolution neural network based on spatial-temporal correlation for air quality prediction" by Dun et al. (2022), where spatial-temporal correlation is used for air quality prediction.

Overall, it appears that a variety of data formats are used in deep learning pipelines for ecological applications, including image, audio, CSV, and time-series data.
