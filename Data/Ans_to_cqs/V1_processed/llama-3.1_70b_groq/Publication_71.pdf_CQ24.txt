Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does discuss some general challenges and strategies related to deep learning methods.

One challenge mentioned is the issue of imbalanced datasets, where the error from overrepresented classes contributes more to the loss value than the error from underrepresented classes. To address this, the context suggests augmenting the training dataset using different brightness levels, adding vertically and horizontally flipped versions, shifting, rotating, or adding noisy versions of the training images.

Additionally, the context provides a table of training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, which includes parameters such as learning policy, base learning rate, and momentum. However, it does not mention random seed values or strategies for handling randomness.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
