The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image classification, as it mentions "Image classification" as a keyword and discusses the use of spectral indices, texture indices, and Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. 

The context also mentions the use of "spectral bands" such as green, red, red edge, and NIR, which suggests that the pipeline involves processing of multispectral or hyperspectral image data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "texture index" and "Run Percentage" calculations, which are typically applied to image data.

However, the exact data format used in the pipeline (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, CSV) is not specified in the provided context.
