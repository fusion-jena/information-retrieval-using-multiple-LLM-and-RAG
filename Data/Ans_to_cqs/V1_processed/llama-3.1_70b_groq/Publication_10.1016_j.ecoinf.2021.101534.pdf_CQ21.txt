Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context only discusses the data transformation steps, model training, and model inference, but does not provide information on what happens after the model is trained.

The context does mention that the initially inferred sounds reviewed by experts can be fed back into the training data, which helps collect training data for rare species. However, this is not a postprocessing step in the classical sense, but rather a way to improve the model's performance by incorporating expert feedback into the training data.

Therefore, I do not know what postprocessing steps are involved after the model training, as this information is not provided in the context.
