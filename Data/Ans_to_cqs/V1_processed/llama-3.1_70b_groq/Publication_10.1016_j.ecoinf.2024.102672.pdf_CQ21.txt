Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.

The context mentions the calculation of metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Percentile (P50) for the regression model, as shown in Table 4. Additionally, the context presents a confusion matrix in Figure 6, which shows the true and predicted classes for the classification model.

There is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in the predictions made by a model. However, this technique is not mentioned or discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps involved after model training, as mentioned in the context, include:

* Metrics calculation (e.g., MAE, Percentile)
* Confusion matrix creation

Note that this answer is based on the limited information provided in the context, and there may be other postprocessing steps involved that are not mentioned.
