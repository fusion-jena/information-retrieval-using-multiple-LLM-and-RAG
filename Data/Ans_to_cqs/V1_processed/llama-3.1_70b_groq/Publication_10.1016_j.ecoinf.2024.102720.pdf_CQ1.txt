Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to research papers and publications in the field of ecological informatics, environmental science, and sustainability. While it mentions the use of deep learning algorithms in strategic planning, it does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, it does mention the use of various data sources such as papers, reports, and datasets in the references section. For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report and the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Project are mentioned as sources of data. But it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
