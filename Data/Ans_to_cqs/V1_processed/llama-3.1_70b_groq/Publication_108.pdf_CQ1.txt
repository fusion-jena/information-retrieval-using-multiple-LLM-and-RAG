The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the case study relied on high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey. This suggests that aerial surveys are one method used for collecting raw data, at least in the context of this specific study. No other methods, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, are mentioned in the provided context.
