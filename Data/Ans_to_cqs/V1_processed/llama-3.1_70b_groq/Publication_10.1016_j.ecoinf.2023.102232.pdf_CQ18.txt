The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text primarily focuses on the combination of least squares methods via genetic algorithms and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate model parameters and obtain their distribution. It discusses the workflow of the algorithm, its application to a specific model, and the potentialities of the algorithm in estimating model parameters. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
