The provided context mentions the use of a dropout layer in the proposed LSTM-based model structure. Specifically, it states that the model consists of "an input layer, three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer." This suggests that dropout is used as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the model. However, there is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.
