Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the performance of different ResNet architectures on a classification task, and the discussion of batch sizes and network depths. 

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have taken place, as the context mentions the use of pre-trained weights from the ImageNet challenge and the replacement of the top fully-connected layer with a new layer. This suggests that the input data might have been preprocessed to be compatible with the pre-trained weights, but the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
