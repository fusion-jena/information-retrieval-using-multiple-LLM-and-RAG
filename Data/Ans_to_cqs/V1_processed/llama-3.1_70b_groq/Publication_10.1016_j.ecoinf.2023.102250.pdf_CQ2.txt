The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "spectrograms" and "images" in the context, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely involves image data. Additionally, the mention of "birdsongs" suggests that audio data might also be involved, but it is not explicitly stated. There is no mention of video or CSV data formats. Therefore, the answer is that the pipeline likely involves image data, and possibly audio data, but the exact formats are not specified.
