The provided context mentions the use of Dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it mentions the use of Dropout(Dropout_Rate) in the model architecture, indicating that Dropout is used to randomly drop out neurons during training to prevent overfitting. However, it does not mention the use of L2 regularization. Therefore, based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting is Dropout.
