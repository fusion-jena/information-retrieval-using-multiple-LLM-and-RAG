Bayesian Optimization.

According to the provided context, Bayesian Optimization is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the random forest model. Specifically, it is used to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development. However, it is not mentioned that Bayesian Optimization is used in a deep learning pipeline. In fact, the context does not mention deep learning or any specific deep learning optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The focus is on machine learning methods, particularly random forest models, and their application in a specific context.
