Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of machine learning tools for classification, but it does not delve into the details of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. It only mentions that machine learning methods are limited by the quality of their inputs (both imagery and training data), but it does not provide information on how to prepare the data for training a model. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this context.
