I don't know. The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain, but it does not provide information on the datasets used.
