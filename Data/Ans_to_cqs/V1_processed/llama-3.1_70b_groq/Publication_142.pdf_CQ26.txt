The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it does suggest a few methods to address data bias during preprocessing:

1. Choosing alternative sources: The context mentions that selecting images from social media targeted at outdoor enthusiasts, such as hikers, could help reduce bias towards formal gardens.
2. Changing the search terms used: This could help reduce taxonomic bias in the data.
3. Pre-filtering images: The context suggests that filtering can be done by carefully selecting the source of images.

Additionally, the context mentions that ecologists and data scientists should carefully consider the steps required to ensure the relevance and accuracy of AI-generated data. It provides an eight-point list of questions to aid in this process, but only two points are mentioned in the provided context:

1. Considering the spatial distribution of images and whether it fits the needs of the research question.
2. Filtering images before classification.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of techniques to address data bias, and other methods such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are not mentioned.
