The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the importance of creating specific datasets tailored to the desired application to address the issue of data drift or domain drift. Additionally, it highlights the need for domain adaptation to increase the transferability of models to datasets with similar statistical properties.

It is mentioned that the model needs to be trained on training data that resembles the data on which the model will be applied later. This suggests that the authors may have taken steps to ensure that the training data is representative of the test data, but the specific measures taken are not explicitly stated.

Therefore, while the context suggests that the authors were aware of the importance of generalizability and took steps to address it, the specific measures taken are not clearly stated.
