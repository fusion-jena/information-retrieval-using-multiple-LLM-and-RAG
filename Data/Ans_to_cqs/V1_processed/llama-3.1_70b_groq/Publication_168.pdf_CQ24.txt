Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, specifically for forest species classification using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral images.

However, it does mention the use of random forest framework for classification of hyperspectral data in one of the references [1]. But it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
