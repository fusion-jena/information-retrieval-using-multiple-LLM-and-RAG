Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to forest inventory analysis and discusses various estimators (NN1, NN2, NN3, NN4) used to estimate forest inventory indices. It does not mention deep learning or techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
