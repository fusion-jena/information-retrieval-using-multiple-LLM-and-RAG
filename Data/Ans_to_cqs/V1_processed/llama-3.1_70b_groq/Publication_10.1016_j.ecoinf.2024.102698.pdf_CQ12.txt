The pipeline uses several types of deep learning models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Specifically, the synthetic connectivity data was generated using a GAN model, while the initial coral cover data was developed using a TVAE model from SDV, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder model. Additionally, the text mentions that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and autoencoders are also considered, but it is not clear if they are used in the pipeline. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
