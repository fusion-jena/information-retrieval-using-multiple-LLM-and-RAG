The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that GF-6 (WFV) data was acquired from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application (http://www.cresda.com/CN/). This suggests that remote sensing data from satellites is being used as a data source.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of photon-counting LiDAR in one of the referenced papers (Leng et al., 2022), which implies that LiDAR data may also be used in certain applications.

However, it does not provide information on the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets as data sources. Therefore, the answer to the query is incomplete, and it can only be confirmed that remote sensing data from satellites and possibly LiDAR data are being used.
