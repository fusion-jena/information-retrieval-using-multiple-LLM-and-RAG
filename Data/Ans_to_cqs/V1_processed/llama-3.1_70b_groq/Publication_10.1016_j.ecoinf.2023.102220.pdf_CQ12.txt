The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The DNN uses the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, while the LSTM is used in addition to the DNN architecture. The output layer of the DNN uses the sigmoid activation function.
