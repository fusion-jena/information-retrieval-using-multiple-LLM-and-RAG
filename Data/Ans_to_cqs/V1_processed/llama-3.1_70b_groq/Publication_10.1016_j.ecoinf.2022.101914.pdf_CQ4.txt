The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to model training and evaluation for a specific task, possibly species distribution modeling or environmental modeling. It discusses procedures for obtaining presences and background points, separating data into folds, and training component models using different subsamples of background points.

There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any data augmentation techniques. The context does mention "scale optimization for environmental covariates" and "focal statistics for each covariate using a moving window of radius equal to each scale to be tested", but this seems to be related to feature engineering and not data augmentation.

Therefore, I don't know what data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, as there is no mention of it in the provided context.
