The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions that the study uses DNA barcode sequences of fish species from different families. The context highlights the challenges of working with small datasets due to the limited number of species in each family and the high dimensionality of the DNA barcode sequences. However, it does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the study.
