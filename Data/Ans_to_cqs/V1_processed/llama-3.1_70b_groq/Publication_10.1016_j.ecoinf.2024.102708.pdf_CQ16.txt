The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation loss curve metrics. Specifically, the best model is selected based on the validation loss curve, which means that the model selected was the one trained until epoch 6 (from the 50 epochs trained). This suggests that the training is considered complete when the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau, which is a common criterion used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.
