The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is classification. Specifically, the model is designed to identify a selection of coralligenous species or their broader taxonomical group, and to assess the biodiversity and ecological status of coralligenous reefs. The model uses a custom methodology, drawing on state-of-the-art architectures and a large database of annotated photographic quadrats, to classify the species or taxonomical groups. The study aims to improve the performance of the model by using techniques such as ensemble networks, multi-scale prediction, and logistic regression on deeply learned features.
