The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a "non-random (biased) reduction" approach in the context of artificially introducing incompleteness in data. This approach involves reducing targets randomly, but only for a few selected targets, to imitate biased incompleteness of only some target labels.

The context also mentions that the study aims to address the issue of structurally incomplete target labels in regression tasks, but it does not provide information on techniques to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide information on techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.
