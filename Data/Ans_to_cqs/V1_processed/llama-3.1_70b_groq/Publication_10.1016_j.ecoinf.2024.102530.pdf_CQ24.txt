I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecological modeling, specifically pollination models, and the use of spatial data and expert knowledge to inform these models. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context, so I am unable to provide a relevant answer to the query.
