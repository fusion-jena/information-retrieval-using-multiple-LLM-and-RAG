Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the performance of different deep learning algorithms for bird object detection, the dataset used, and the results of the study. It does not provide information on the data augmentation techniques used, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
