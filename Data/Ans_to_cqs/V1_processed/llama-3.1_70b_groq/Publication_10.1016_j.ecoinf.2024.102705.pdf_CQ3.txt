Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in image processing, computer vision, and ecological information extraction from camera trap images. It discusses the use of neural networks, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), and optimization algorithms, but does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of labeled outputs in training neural networks, which implies that some form of data annotation is involved. Nevertheless, the specific techniques used for data annotation are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
