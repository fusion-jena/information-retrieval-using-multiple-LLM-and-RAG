Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of hyperparameters for the deep neural network (DNN) architecture and the training process. It discusses the search space of primary hyperparameters, the execution of optimization algorithms, and the training of the model for a certain number of epochs. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
