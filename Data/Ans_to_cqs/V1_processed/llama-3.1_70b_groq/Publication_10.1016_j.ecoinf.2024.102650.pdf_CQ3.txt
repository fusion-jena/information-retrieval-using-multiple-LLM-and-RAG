Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis, specifically on theme perception technology and topic modeling using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the ERNIE model.

However, it does mention that machine learning methods require text preprocessing, such as word segmentation and stop word removal, followed by the selection of a text portion to manually annotate emotions for accuracy verification. This suggests that manual annotation of emotions is used as a technique for data annotation in the context of NLP, but it does not provide information on annotation techniques used in computer vision or deep learning pipelines.
