Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the iterative model exploration process, the Bayesian workflow, and the use of different models such as random forest, Bayesian logistic regression, and Bayesian GAM. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
