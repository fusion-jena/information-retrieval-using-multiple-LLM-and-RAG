The provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model. However, based on the text, it appears that the context is discussing the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for regional zoning and clustering. The text mentions that machine learning is used to study the mechanisms that drive regional differentiation and to perform regional zoning. It also mentions that the training efficiency of SVM for large sample datasets is not ideal and that further optimization of the training algorithm is needed.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model in this context is likely related to classification or clustering, possibly for regional zoning or identification of patterns in large datasets. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer.
