Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on optimizing data structures for machine learning classification, hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, and the challenges associated with using XAI techniques.

However, it does mention the importance of selecting the most pertinent predictors from S2 imagery to enhance the model's performance. It also acknowledges the need for broader validation across diverse ecosystems and varying levels of fire severity, which could be related to addressing data bias. Nevertheless, it does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
