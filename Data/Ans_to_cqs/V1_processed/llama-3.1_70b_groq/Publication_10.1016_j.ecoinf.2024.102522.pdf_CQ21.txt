Based on the provided context, it appears that the model training has been completed, and the results are presented in various tables. However, the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned.

From the tables provided, it can be inferred that some postprocessing steps have been performed, such as:

1. Metrics calculation: The tables provide various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which suggest that these metrics have been calculated after the model training.
2. Confusion matrix: Table 4 and Table 8 appear to be confusion matrices, which are used to evaluate the performance of the model.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps, which are a type of visualization used to understand which input features are most important for the model's predictions.

Therefore, while some postprocessing steps have been performed, the specific steps involved are not fully described in the provided context.
