The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the research involves analyzing large-scale audio datasets, specifically from urban acoustic environments. It mentions that the researchers calculate a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for all recordings of their dataset, which suggests that the data format used is likely audio recordings in a format that can be processed by the FFT algorithm, such as WAV or MP3. However, the exact data format is not specified.
