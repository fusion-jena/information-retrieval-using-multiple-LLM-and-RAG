Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, but does not provide details on the hyperparameters used to train these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
