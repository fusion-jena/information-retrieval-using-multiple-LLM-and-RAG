I don't know. The provided pieces of context do not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. They appear to be a collection of research papers and articles discussing the use of deep learning and computer vision for ecological research, insect detection, and biodiversity assessment. None of the texts mention a specific code repository or provide a link to one.
