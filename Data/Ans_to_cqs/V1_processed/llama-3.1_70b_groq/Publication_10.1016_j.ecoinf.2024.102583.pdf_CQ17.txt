Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the use of ensemble techniques, such as XGBoost, and other machine learning models like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). It also mentions that techniques like ensemble learning, weighted average, and cross-validation can help mitigate overfitting issues, but it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
