Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis, discussing topics like word embeddings (e.g., Word2vec), semantic analysis, and text mining. It does not provide information on computer vision or image annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
