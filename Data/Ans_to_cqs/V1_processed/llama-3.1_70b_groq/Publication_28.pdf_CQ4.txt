Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the performance comparison of various deep learning models, including PTDLEN-VAE, on the AIM dataset, and provides information about the architecture of EfficientNet. It also explains the concept of Autoencoder (AE) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE). However, it does not provide any information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
