I don't know. The provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and geospatial analysis, with mentions of spectral bands, vegetation indices, and wildfire recovery. It does not seem to be relevant to deep learning or computer vision datasets.
