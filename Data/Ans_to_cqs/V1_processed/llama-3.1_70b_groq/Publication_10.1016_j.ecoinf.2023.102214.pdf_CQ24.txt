Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the dataset, image classification, and detection algorithms, as well as the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models. It does mention the process of tuning the number of required epochs and inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
