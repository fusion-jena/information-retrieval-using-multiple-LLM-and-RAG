Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on feature selection methods, specifically the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method, and the performance of different models (statistical and machine learning) in predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
