Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the MLOps layer, data preprocessing, and model training architecture. It discusses the use of techniques such as normalization, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the use of validation and test datasets, which implies that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation may be involved. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of monitoring and automation in the MLOps layer, which could potentially involve the use of techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Nevertheless, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this query.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, as this information is not provided in the given context.
