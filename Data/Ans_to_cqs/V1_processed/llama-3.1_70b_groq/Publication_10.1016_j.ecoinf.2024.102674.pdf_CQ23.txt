Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in the paper "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022). The context primarily discusses other papers and methods related to downscaling climate data, species distribution models, and spatial models.

However, it does mention that cross-validation was used in the context of evaluating the performance of different algorithms (RFs, GBMs, and ANNs) for downscaling climate data. Specifically, it mentions that the biases in the models were reflected in the cross-validations, with consistently negative average pbias values during the hot season and positive average pbias values during the cold season.

It does not provide information on whether a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
