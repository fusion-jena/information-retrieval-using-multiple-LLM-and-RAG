The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention "Loudness normalization" as one of the data augmentation techniques used in the study. This suggests that some form of normalization might be involved in the preprocessing steps, but the exact details are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the models were fine-tuned using ImageNet-based weights for pretraining, which implies that the input data might have been preprocessed to match the format and scale of the ImageNet dataset. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, while we can infer that some form of normalization might be involved, the exact preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
