The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, and precision. 

Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Recall is a measure of false negatives, calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN), i.e., recall = TP / (TP + FN). Precision is a measure of false positives, calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP), i.e., precision = TP / (TP + FP).

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance in identifying species correctly. The choice of metric to optimize depends on the focus of the study. For example, if the focus is on rare species, precision should be optimized, while if the focus is on common species, recall should be optimized.
