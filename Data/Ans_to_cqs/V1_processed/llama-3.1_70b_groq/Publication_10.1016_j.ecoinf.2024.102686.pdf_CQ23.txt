Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The text mentions the use of machine learning and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for regional zoning, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
