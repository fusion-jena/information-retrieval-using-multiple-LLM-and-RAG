The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically bird classification using visual and acoustic data. The model is designed to analyze and provide a holistic overview of the habitat by studying both image and acoustic data. The model's performance is measured using metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and Accuracy, which are commonly used in classification tasks. The model is trained to classify different bird species, and the study mentions that future work will expand the number of classes in the model.
