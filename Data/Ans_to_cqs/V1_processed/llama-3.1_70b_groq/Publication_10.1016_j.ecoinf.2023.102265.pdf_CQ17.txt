Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of ResNet-50 for feature extraction, the comparison of different variants of ResNet, and the performance of the proposed method, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
