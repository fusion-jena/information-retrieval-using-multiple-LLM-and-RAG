I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. It does mention the use of various machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), neural network (Ocean Color Network), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), XGBoost, and CatBoost, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used.
