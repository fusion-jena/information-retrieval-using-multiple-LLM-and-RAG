Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the images were "randomly cropped" to a size of 512 Ã— 512 before training, which suggests that some form of data augmentation or preprocessing was performed.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on images that were "fully labeled", which implies that some form of data cleaning or annotation was performed to prepare the data for training.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions that the model was pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset of images. This pretraining likely involved some form of normalization or scaling of the images, but the specific details are not provided.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the preprocessing steps involved, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question. Therefore, I must say that I don't know the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
