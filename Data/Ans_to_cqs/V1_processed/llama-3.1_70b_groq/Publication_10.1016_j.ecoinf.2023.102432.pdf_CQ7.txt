The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the single pixel dataset was split into training and testing data using 5 K-fold cross-validations for the Random Forest approach. 

In the context of Random Forest, the data is split into training and testing sets using 5 K-fold cross-validation, which means the data is divided into 5 folds, and each fold is used as a testing set while the remaining 4 folds are used as the training set. This process is repeated 5 times, with each fold being used as the testing set once. 

However, the context does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in general, or the specific criteria used for splitting the data into validation sets.
