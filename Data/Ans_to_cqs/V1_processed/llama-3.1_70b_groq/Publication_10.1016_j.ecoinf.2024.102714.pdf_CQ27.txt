Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the generation of training and testing datasets, the use of the XGBoostClassifier algorithm, and the input features used for the model. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The context appears to focus on the development and testing of the model, including the generation of datasets, the selection of input features, and the evaluation of the model's accuracy. It does not discuss the deployment of the model, including any potential model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
