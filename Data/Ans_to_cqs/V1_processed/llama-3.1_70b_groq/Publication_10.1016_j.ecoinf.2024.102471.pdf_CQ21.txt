Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the pre-training and fine-tuning phases of the Wav2Vec model, as well as the model architecture and training parameters. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps or evaluation metrics used after the model training.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
