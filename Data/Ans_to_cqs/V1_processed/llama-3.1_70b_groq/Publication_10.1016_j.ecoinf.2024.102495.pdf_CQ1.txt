Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the feature extraction and deep learning model optimization aspects of the pipeline, particularly in the context of mosquito voice recording classification.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected through audio recordings of mosquito voices, as mentioned in the context. The specific methods used for collecting these recordings, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
