The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is yield prediction, specifically predicting the yield of oil palm crops. The study uses various deep learning algorithms, such as Deep Neural Networks, to construct predictive models that can accurately forecast oil palm yield based on various agronomic parameters, including soil composition, climate variations, plant age, and farming techniques. The goal of the study is to develop a model that can provide precise yield predictions, which can be used to enhance agricultural practices, optimize the supply chain, and promote sustainable farming practices.
