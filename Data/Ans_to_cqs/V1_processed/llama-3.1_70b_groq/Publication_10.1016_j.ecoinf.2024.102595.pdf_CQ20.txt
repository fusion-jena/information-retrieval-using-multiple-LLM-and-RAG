Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text only discusses the methodology, data preprocessing, and the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predicting oil palm yields, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
