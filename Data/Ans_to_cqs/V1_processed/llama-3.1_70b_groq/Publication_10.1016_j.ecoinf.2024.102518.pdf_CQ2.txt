Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the study involves species distribution modeling, and the data used includes occurrence data and environmental variables. The context mentions the use of metrics such as AUC-ROC and CBI, which are commonly used in species distribution modeling. Additionally, the context mentions the use of regularization multiplier and feature classes, which suggests that the data may be in a tabular format, possibly CSV. However, without explicit mention of the data formats, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
