Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for research data, data repositories, and the use of tools such as F-UJI for evaluating the FAIRness of datasets. It does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
