To ensure the generalizability of the model, environmental cross-validation with ten folds was performed. This approach helps to accurately represent the predictive error of the model in new environments. Additionally, the model hyperparameters were tuned using Bayesian optimization, which focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions. This optimization process was performed separately for each species-specific model.

While the text does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting, the use of environmental cross-validation with ten folds suggests that the model was evaluated on a variety of environmental conditions, which can help to improve its generalizability.

It is also worth noting that the model was evaluated using Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), which helped to uncover patterns between model predictors and species-specific productivity. The resulting PDPs were evaluated using existing scientific knowledge to determine whether the patterns found were ecologically consistent. This approach can help to ensure that the model is not only generalizable but also ecologically meaningful.

However, the text does not provide information on whether the dataset was diverse or whether stratified splitting was used. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to the query based on the provided context.
