Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on coral reefs, marine biology, and network analysis, with only one mention of a deep learning model in the paper by Do and Tran (2023). However, this paper does not provide information on the preprocessing steps used.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
