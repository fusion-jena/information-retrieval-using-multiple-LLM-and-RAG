Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text appears to be a research article about applying machine learning to predict reproductive condition in fish, and it discusses the use of Random Forests (RF) analysis, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
