I don't know. The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. In fact, the context does not mention deep learning or any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. It appears to be a discussion of a study on environmental data analysis using a Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) and mentions data collection and processing, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.
