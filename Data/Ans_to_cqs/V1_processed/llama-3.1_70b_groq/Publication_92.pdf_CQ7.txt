Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the importance of data preprocessing, the creation of a training database, and the addition of new classes to the database, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to tune hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training.

In the context of the provided text, it is mentioned that the authors worked with biology experts to label many videos and created a training database composed of 13000 fish thumbnails. However, it is not specified how this data was split for training, validation, and testing.
