Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite data from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Landsat satellites, and Sentinel-2 (MSI) for estimating water quality parameters. It also mentions the use of measured data from lakes in China for training machine learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of hyperspectral data, which suggests that remote sensing data may be used as a source of raw data. However, it does not provide further details on the specific methods used for collecting this data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that remote sensing data from satellites and measured data from lakes may be used as sources of raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, the exact methods used for collecting this data are not specified.
