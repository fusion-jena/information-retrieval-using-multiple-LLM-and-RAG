The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the data were split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. This suggests that the model performance was likely monitored using the validation set during training. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the learning rate is divided by 10 every 20 epochs until reaching 10âˆ’6, which implies that the model's performance was being monitored and adjusted during training. However, the exact strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance are not specified.
