The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the approach involves processing images, specifically survey images of wildebeest. It also mentions that the images were tiled into 864 Ã— 864 subimages and passed through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that the raw count data is available in a repository, but it does not specify the format of the data. It does provide a link to the repository, but without accessing the repository, it is not possible to determine the exact data format.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that images are used in the deep learning pipeline, but the exact format of the images (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) is not specified. It is also possible that other data formats, such as CSV, may be used to store the count data, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the context.
