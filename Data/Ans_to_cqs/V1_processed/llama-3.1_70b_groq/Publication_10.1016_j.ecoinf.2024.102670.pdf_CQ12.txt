According to the provided context, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is mentioned as a deep learning model used in the pipeline. Specifically, Xu et al. (2021) developed a CNN-based segmentation model, which was compared to other methods, including the PCT method developed in Obara et al. (2012). However, it is not explicitly stated that this CNN model is part of the pipeline being referred to in the query. Therefore, while CNN is mentioned as a deep learning model used in a related context, it is not clear if it is the specific model used in the pipeline.
