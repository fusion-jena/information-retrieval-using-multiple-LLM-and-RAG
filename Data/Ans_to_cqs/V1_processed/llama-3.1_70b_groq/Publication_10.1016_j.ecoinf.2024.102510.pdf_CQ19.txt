Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context appears to be focused on the performance comparison of various pre-trained models, such as MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, GoogleNet, and others, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models.

Therefore, I do not know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the context.
