Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, ecology, and the application of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction. It does mention the use of machine learning techniques, including deep learning models, but does not discuss the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
