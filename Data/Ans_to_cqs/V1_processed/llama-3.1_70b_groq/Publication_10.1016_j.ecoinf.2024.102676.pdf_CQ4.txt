Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on missing value imputation methods, such as mean imputation and the missForest approach, as well as the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method. It also mentions the use of imperfect footprints and the potential of utilizing lower-quality data effectively, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
