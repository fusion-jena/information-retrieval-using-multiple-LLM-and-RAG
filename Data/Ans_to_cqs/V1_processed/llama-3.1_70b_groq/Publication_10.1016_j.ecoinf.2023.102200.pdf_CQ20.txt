Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the training parameters, such as the number of iterations, learning rate, momentum, and batch size, but does not provide information on the hardware used for training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
