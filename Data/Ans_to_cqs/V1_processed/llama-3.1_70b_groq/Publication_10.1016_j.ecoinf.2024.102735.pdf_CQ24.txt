Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of machine learning models, particularly random forest, for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).

However, it does mention that the prediction distributions used to estimate uncertainty in the models' predictions were obtained by utilizing optimized models developed through randomized subsets of training data. This suggests that the authors employed some form of randomization or bootstrapping to assess the uncertainty in their models, but it does not provide specific details on how randomness was handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
