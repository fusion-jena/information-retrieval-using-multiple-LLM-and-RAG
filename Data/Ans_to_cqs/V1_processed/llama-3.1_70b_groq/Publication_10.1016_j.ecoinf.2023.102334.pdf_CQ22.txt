According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and other evaluation indicators. Specifically, the confusion matrix is used to calculate these metrics. The confusion matrix is normalized in the row direction, and the main diagonal position represents the ratio of the model's correct predictions for each category. The sum of the data excluding the main diagonal position in each row represents the rate of missed detection for each category.

Additionally, Table 4 provides a comparison of the performance of different models, including the proposed model, in terms of accuracy. The accuracy values range from 90.96% to 98.58%, with the proposed model achieving the highest accuracy of 98.58%.

It is also mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated in terms of the number of parameters, model size, and loss. The number of parameters and model size are considered important metrics, as the proposed model needs to be improved in terms of the number of parameters.

Overall, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Number of parameters
* Model size
* Loss

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and help identify areas for improvement.
