The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention a few techniques that can be related to improving the model's generalization capability.

For instance, the context mentions the integration of auxiliary data, such as climate or soil characteristics, to fortify the neural network's generalization capability. Additionally, it mentions the use of transfer learning techniques to leverage insights from auxiliary datasets, enabling the model to make informed predictions in historical periods with limited direct data.

Furthermore, the context describes the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which includes a pooling layer. The pooling layer is mentioned to help reduce the number of parameters and computations, enhance invariance to small shifts and scale changes, and improve the model's generalization ability.

While these techniques can contribute to improving the model's generalizability, the context does not provide explicit information on the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is unclear whether these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
