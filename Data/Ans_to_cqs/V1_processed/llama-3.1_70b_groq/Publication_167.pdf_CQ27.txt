Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the input data, batch normalization, and the use of deep learning models in the remote sensing domain, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context does mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning-based models to fit the drivers and mechanisms of land use and land cover change (LUCC), but it does not provide details on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
