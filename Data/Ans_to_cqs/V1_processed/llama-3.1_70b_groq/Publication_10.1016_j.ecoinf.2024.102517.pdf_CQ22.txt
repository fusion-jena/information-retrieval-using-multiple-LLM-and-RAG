The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention the use of certain metrics to evaluate the performance of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss.

According to the context, the performance of the noise reduction algorithms is compared using metrics such as Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). These metrics are used to evaluate the quality of the denoised bird sound signals.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, or recall, it does mention the use of SNR, PESQ, and PSNR to evaluate the performance of the noise reduction algorithms.
