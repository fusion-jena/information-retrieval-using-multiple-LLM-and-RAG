The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of underwater videos for coral reef fish detection and recognition. It also mentions the creation of a thumbnail database with classes such as "part of fish," "fish," and "random/speciÔ¨Åc background." 

The context suggests that the data may be collected from underwater videos, but it does not provide information on how the videos were obtained or if any other methods were used for data collection. It also mentions the use of a learning database, but it does not specify how the data in the database was collected.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that underwater videos may be one of the methods used for collecting raw data, but the exact methods used for data collection are not specified.
