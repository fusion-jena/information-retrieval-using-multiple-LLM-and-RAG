Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of a deep learning model for agricultural pests recognition, including the use of pre-trained CNN architectures such as Inception, Residual Neural Network (Resnet), and Dense Convolutional Network (Densenet).

However, it can be inferred that the input image is fed into the model, and the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer takes the region corresponding to a proposal from the backbone feature map. This suggests that some form of image processing or feature extraction may be involved, but the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
