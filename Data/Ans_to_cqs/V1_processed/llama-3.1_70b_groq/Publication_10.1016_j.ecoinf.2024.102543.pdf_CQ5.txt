Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context only mentions that the training set consists of 4000 images, the validation set consists of 607 images, and the testing set consists of 260 images, but it does not provide information about the source or name of the dataset. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
