Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the classification techniques used for large-vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls, including a "shallow learning" approach and a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation. It does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline.
