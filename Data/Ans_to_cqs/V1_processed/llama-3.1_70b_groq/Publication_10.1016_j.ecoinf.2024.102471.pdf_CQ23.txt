The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was tested on two datasets, one with 30 bird species, and achieved high accuracy rates of 89.61% and 91.49%, respectively. This suggests that the model was evaluated on diverse datasets, which can contribute to its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was pre-trained on a large dataset and fine-tuned on a specific task, which is a common approach to transfer learning. This approach can help the model learn general features that can be applied to different datasets and tasks.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to evaluate the generalizability of a model. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques were used in the development of the model.

Overall, while the context suggests that the model was evaluated on diverse datasets, it does not provide detailed information on the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.
