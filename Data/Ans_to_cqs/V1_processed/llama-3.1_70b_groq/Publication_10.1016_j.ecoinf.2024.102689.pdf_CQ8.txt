Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of Python 3.6, Pytorch version 1.8.0, and Anaconda3, but it does not provide information about where the code is hosted.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
