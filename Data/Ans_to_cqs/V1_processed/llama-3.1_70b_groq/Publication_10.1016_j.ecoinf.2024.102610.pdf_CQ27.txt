Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the development and training of machine learning models, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

However, it does mention the use of R programming and specific packages such as Caret and VSURF for analysis and model training. But the deployment process, including model serialization and platform selection, is not discussed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
