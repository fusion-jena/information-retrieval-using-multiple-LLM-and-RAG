Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that data augmentation is a method used to address the problem of limited data.

According to the context, Wong et al. (2016) and Wang and Perez (2017) have discussed data augmentation for classification tasks. However, the specific techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.

It is worth noting that data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization. However, without more specific information, we cannot confirm if these techniques are mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
