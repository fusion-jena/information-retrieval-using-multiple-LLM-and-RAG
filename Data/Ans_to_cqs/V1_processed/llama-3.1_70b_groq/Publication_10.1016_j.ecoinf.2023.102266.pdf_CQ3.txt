I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a cellular automaton model, specifically discussing modifications to the update criterion, optimizing the scope, and strategies for variance reduction. It also mentions the limitations of the model as a classification model and provides some mathematical expressions. However, it does not mention data annotation techniques or deep learning pipelines.
