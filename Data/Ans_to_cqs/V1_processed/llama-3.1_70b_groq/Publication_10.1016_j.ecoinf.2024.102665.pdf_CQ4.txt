Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on coral reefs, fish, and benthic communities, as well as some references to deep learning models and optimization algorithms. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

The only relevant reference to a deep learning model is in the paper by Do, A.N.T., and Tran, H.D. (2023), which mentions combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. However, it does not provide details on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
