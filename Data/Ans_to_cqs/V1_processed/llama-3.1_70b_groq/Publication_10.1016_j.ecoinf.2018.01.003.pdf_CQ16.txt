Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to a research paper on predicting the Ecological Footprint (EF) of Beijing using a Partial Least Squares (PLS) model and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The text discusses the performance of the models, including their explanatory power and accuracy, but does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
