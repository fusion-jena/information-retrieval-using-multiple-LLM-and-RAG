Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that deep learning algorithms can be applied to hyperspectral data to predict water quality parameters with better accuracy and performance. It also mentions that artificial neural networks (ANN) and extreme machine learning have been used for developing semi-empirical models, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the context.
