Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling (Benkendorf and Hawkins, 2020) and a random forest model, which is a machine learning model based on decision trees (Breiman, 2001), but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
