The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is classification, specifically for bumble bee species classification. The models compared in the study are convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that vary in complexity of architecture, and their performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and speed for classifying bumble bee species.
