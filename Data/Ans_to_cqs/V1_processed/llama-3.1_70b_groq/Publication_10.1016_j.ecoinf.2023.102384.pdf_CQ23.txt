Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to focus on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model, specifically the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE).

However, it is mentioned that the evaluation is performed on a non-publicly available dataset, and the context does not provide information on the dataset's diversity, size, or splitting strategy (e.g., cross-validation, stratified splitting). Therefore, it is unclear what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

It is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a test split, which suggests that some form of splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine the specifics of the splitting strategy or other measures taken to ensure generalizability.
