I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning in general, citing a paper by LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton (2015) on deep learning, and mentions various deep learning frameworks such as Theano, Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow, and deeplearning4j in a paper by Kovalev et al. (2016). However, it does not provide information on a specific pipeline or the type of deep learning model used in it.
