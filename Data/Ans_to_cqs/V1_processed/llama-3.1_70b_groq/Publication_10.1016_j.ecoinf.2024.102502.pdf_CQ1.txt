The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Earth Observation System (EOS) data, which is collected from satellites. The context also mentions the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) online repository, which provides access to a large collection of satellite data.

It can be inferred that the data collection method used in this context is through satellite remote sensing, where data is collected from satellites orbiting the Earth. The context also mentions the use of public datasets, specifically the EOS data catalogue from the GEE online repository.

There is no mention of surveys or other methods of data collection in the provided context. Therefore, the answer to the query is limited to satellite remote sensing and public datasets, specifically the EOS data catalogue from the GEE online repository.
