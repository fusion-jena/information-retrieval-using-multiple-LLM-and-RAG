The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study employs a weakly supervised learning approach, combining data from the iNaturalist database and the TRY database. The iNaturalist database provides a worldwide record of plant photographs with taxa and geolocations, but it does not provide detailed annotations such as bounding box annotations or instance segmentation.

The study uses a transfer learning approach, utilizing pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on the ImageNet dataset. This suggests that the images used in the study may not have been annotated with specific bounding boxes or instance segmentation, but rather used the pre-trained weights as a starting point for the model.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the study likely did not use detailed annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, instead relying on the pre-trained weights and the weakly supervised learning approach.
