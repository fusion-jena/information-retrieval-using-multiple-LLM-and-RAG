The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation loss and the model's average precision (AP). According to the provided context, the training process is considered complete when the validation loss stabilizes and the model's mean AP (mAP) over the three insect classes improves with the number of training epochs. 

Specifically, the context mentions that the validation loss stabilizes after 30 epochs, suggesting that further training might lead to overfitting. This is used as an indicator to stop the training process. Additionally, the plot of the model's mean AP (mAP) over the three insect classes shows that the model's performance improves with the number of training epochs, providing another perspective on the training process.

Therefore, the criteria used to determine when training is complete are the stabilization of the validation loss and the improvement of the model's average precision (AP) over the training epochs.
