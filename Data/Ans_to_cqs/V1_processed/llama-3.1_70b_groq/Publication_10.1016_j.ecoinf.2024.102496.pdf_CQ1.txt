Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on environmental topics such as water quality, green infrastructure, and watershed management, but it does not provide information on data collection methods for deep learning pipelines.

However, it does mention the use of data-driven approaches such as machine learning, and the importance of accurate data collection and updating of input parameters in the PLET model. It also mentions the use of existing datasets, such as the Watershed Boundary Dataset from the United States Geological Survey.

But it does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
