Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Automatic imaging trap: Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) collected 25,378 annotated images from 24 pest species using an automatic imaging trap.
2. Multiple wireless imaging devices: Rustia et al. (2021) acquired data using multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses under varying lighting environments.
3. Sticky plate images: Figure 5 illustrates the use of sticky plate images, which are tiled into regions of interest of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) to contain the maximum number of complete bounding boxes.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the "Pest24" dataset was used, which consists of 25,378 annotated images, but it is not clear if this dataset is publicly available.
