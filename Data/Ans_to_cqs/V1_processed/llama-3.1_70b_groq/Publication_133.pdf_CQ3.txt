The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the study uses deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification and object detection tasks.

It also mentions the use of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN, which are object detection algorithms that typically require bounding box annotations. YOLO is known to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one pass, suggesting that bounding box annotation might be used in this pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions that the study uses the COCO dataset, which is a large-scale object detection dataset that provides instance segmentation annotations. However, it is not explicitly stated whether instance segmentation is used in this specific study.

Therefore, while we can infer that bounding box annotation might be used in this pipeline, we cannot confirm the use of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques with certainty based on the provided context.
