Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses feature selection methods, including forward feature selection (FFS) and cross-validation (CV) techniques, as well as modeling options like random forest and Bayesian GAM. However, it does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this query.
