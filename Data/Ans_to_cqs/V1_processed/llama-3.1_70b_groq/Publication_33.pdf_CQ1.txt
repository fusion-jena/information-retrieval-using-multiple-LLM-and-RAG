The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include surveys using photos or videos, and remote sensors. Specifically, the authors of the study used underwater high-definition videos recorded using GoPro Hero 3+ black and Hero 4+ black cameras to collect fish images. These videos were recorded in various conditions, including different depths, luminosity, transparency, and benthic environments on fringing and barrier reefs. The videos were then used to extract fish images, which were used to train and test the deep learning model.

Additionally, the authors mention that they decided to build their own dataset instead of using existing datasets, such as Fish4Knowledge. This suggests that public datasets can also be a source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. However, the authors chose to collect their own data to ensure that it was in line with the quality of videos currently used by marine ecologists.
