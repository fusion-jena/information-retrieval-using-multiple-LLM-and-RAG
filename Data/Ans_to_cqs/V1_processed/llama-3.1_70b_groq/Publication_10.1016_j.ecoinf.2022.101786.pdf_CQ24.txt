Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text primarily discusses the training process of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a deep-sea ecological informatics task, including model evaluation, selection, and the influence of the number of iterations on performance. It also mentions the use of manual annotations to generate training, validation, and testing datasets, but does not address randomness or random seed values explicitly. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
