Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of various object detection models, including YOLOv5, and their performance metrics. It also discusses the network architecture of the depth-attention YOLOv5 and the attention mechanism used.

However, it does mention the use of a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, which is a common optimization algorithm used in deep learning. SGD is a stochastic optimization method that uses random sampling to update the model parameters, which can help to handle randomness in the training process. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a batch size and accumulation of gradients, which can also help to reduce the impact of randomness in the training process.

But, it does not provide information on how the randomness is handled in terms of random seed values or other strategies. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
