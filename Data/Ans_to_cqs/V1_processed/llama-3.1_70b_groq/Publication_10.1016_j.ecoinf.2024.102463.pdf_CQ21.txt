Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model optimization process, including hyperparameter tuning using the Hyperband algorithm, partial training, and successive halving. It also mentions data standardization and the use of the Keras library with TensorFlow backend for model development. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that occur after model training.
