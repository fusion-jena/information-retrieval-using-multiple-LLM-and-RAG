Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the fine-tuning process, the training procedure, and the use of hard negative patches to reduce false positives, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
