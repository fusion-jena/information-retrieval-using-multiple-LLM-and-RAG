The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the number of epochs was maintained at 500 as it proved to guarantee the stabilization of the loss curves during the training. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored through the loss curves, but the specific strategy or metrics used to evaluate the performance are not specified.
