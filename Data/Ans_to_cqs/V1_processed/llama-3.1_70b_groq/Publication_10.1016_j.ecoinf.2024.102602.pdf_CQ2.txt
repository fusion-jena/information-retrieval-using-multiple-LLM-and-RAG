The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images. The context mentions the resizing and normalization of images, as well as the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of online digital images for environmental monitoring, including the recognition and surveillance of plant diseases, classification of land cover, and detection and classification of animals in camera traps.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are also not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
