I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and its parameters, including C, ε, and σ. It also mentions the formulation of the SVR model and the role of each parameter, but it does not provide information about the deep learning model. The section on deep learning is incomplete and only mentions the SLSTM method, but it does not provide any details about the hyperparameters used.
