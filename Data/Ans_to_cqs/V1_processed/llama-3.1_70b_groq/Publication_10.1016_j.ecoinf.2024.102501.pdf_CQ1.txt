Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water, citing various research studies and models. It does not provide information on the data collection process.

However, it can be inferred that the data used in these studies might have been collected from various sources such as water quality monitoring stations, sensors, and public datasets. For instance, the context mentions the use of water quality parameters, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure as input variables for the model, suggesting that the data might have been collected from environmental monitoring stations or sensors.

But without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query. Therefore, I can only speculate on the possible methods used for collecting raw data, but I do not have concrete evidence to support my claims.
