Randomly shuffle the training data.

According to the provided context, in the training loop of the AODEGRU model, the training data is randomly shuffled at the beginning of each epoch (step 7). This is a common strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, as it helps to reduce overfitting and ensures that the model is trained on different sequences of the data each epoch. However, the specific random seed value used is not mentioned in the provided context.
