Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecology, environmental science, and geographic information systems (GIS), with a focus on species distribution modeling and socioeconomic data analysis.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in machine learning pipelines. In the context of the provided text, there is a mention of "bagging" in the RandomForest analysis, which is a technique used to reduce variance and improve the stability of machine learning models. Bagging involves training multiple models on different subsets of the data and combining their predictions to reduce the impact of randomness.

Additionally, the text mentions "balanced weights" in the RandomForest analysis, which can help to reduce the impact of class imbalance and randomness in the data.

However, I couldn't find any specific information on handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value, in the provided context. If you're looking for information on deep learning, I'd be happy to try and help with a different set of context or provide general information on the topic.
