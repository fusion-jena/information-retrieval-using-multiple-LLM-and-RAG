The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of different feature representations (Spectral Indices, MFCC, and Auto-Encoder-based) and their execution times, as well as the results of some experiments. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.
