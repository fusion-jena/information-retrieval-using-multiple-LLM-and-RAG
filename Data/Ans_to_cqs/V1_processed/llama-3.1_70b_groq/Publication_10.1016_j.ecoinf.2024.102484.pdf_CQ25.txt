The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the title of the paper "Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning" by Huang et al. (2019), it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely used for classification or change detection tasks, such as identifying changes in land cover or land use patterns in the study area.
