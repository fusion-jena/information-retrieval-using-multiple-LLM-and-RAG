According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Horizontal flipping
2. Color jittering
3. Rotation
4. Erasing

These techniques were applied randomly to the training sets to avoid overfitting and imbalanced problems. The original images were captured under different illumination and angles, and the data augmentation techniques were used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and make the model more robust to variations in the input data.
