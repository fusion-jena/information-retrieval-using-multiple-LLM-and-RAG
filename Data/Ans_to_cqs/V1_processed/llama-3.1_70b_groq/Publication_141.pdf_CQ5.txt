The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as one of the well-known datasets like MNIST or CIFAR. However, it is mentioned that the network architecture used is ResNet-50, which is a pre-trained model on the ImageNet dataset. The authors also mention that the ImageNet dataset does not contain any similar objects to the ones in their dataset (Chironomidae, non-biting midges). This suggests that the authors used a custom dataset for their specific application in biomonitoring studies, but leveraged the pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset as a starting point for their model.
