Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references and figures provided, it can be inferred that image data is used in the pipeline.

For example, Figure 1 shows an overall methodology that involves processing images, and Figure 2 shows a user interface for man-made object detection and splitting, which suggests that image data is being used. Additionally, the reference to "high-pixels-per-image (HPP) images up to 50 MB" in the text also supports the use of image data.

However, it is not possible to determine if other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
