I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be discussing the analysis of cow calls using software called Kaleidoscope, and the parameters used to detect these calls, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion.
