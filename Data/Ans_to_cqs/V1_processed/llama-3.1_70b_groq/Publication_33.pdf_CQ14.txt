The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the calibration of Deep Learning models using a single parameter for all classes and the tuning of a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class using a second and independent database. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, as this information is not provided in the given context.
