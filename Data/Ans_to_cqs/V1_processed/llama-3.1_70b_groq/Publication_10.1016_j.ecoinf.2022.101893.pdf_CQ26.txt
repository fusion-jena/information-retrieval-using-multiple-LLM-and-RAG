Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, the hardware platform used for the experiment, and the results of the classification models.

However, it does mention that the datasets are divided into training and test sets according to a ratio of 8:2, which is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that the model is trained and tested on separate datasets. But it does not provide any information on how the data was preprocessed to address potential biases.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or information, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
