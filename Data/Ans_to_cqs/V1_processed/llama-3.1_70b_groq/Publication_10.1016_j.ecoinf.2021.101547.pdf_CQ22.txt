Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. It mentions that the network computes a 'loss' score for each image based on the difference between the estimated class probability scores and the actual scores, but it does not specify the metrics used to evaluate the overall performance of the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
