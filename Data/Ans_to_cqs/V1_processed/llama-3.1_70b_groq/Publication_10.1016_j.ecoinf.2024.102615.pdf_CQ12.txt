The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of multiple dense layers with ReLu activation functions, batch normalization layers, and dropout layers. The MLP model is a type of feedforward neural network, which is a common architecture used for tasks such as regression and classification. There is no mention of convolutional or recurrent layers, which are characteristic of CNNs and RNNs, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the model used in the pipeline is an MLP model.
