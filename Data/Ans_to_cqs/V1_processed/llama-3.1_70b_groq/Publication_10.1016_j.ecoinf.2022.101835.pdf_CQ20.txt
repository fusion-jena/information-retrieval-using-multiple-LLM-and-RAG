Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context only mentions the software libraries and frameworks used, such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Optuna, but does not provide information about the hardware resources utilized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
