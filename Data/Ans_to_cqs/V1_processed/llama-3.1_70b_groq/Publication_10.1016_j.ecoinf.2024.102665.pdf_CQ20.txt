I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the methodology and results of the research, including the use of a deep learning model and optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. However, it does not provide information on the computational resources used to train the model.
