Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the input data consists of images, specifically NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) images, which are used for vegetation cover study and crop phenology detection. The context also mentions the fusion of optical and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, which suggests that the pipeline may handle multiple types of image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
