The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that some postprocessing steps are involved, as the context mentions the calculation of various metrics and the creation of visualizations.

The context mentions the creation of a confusion matrix (Fig. 6), F1 curve (Fig. 7), P curve (Fig. 8), PR curve (Fig. 9), R curve (Fig. 10), and final training plots (Fig. 11). These visualizations suggest that some metrics calculation is involved, but the specific postprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions the creation of training batch outputs (Fig. 12) and validation outputs (Fig. 13), which suggests that some form of output analysis or visualization is involved. However, the specific postprocessing steps involved in creating these outputs are not mentioned.

Regarding saliency maps, there is no mention of them in the provided context.

Therefore, while it can be inferred that some postprocessing steps are involved, the specific steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
