To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the techniques used in this study include:

1. **Stratified sampling**: Although not strictly followed, the study used vegetation types to guide the placement of sampling plots, ensuring that the training and validation points were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary.
2. **Diverse data collection**: The study created several small sampling plots within each vegetation type to collect training and validation points, which helped to speed up the sampling process and ensured that the data was representative of the diverse vegetation.
3. **Oversampling**: To address the issue of an unbalanced training set, the study created a separate geometry, 'add trees', where well-defined examples of woody cover elements were added until the two classes had the same number of training points.

However, it's worth noting that the study did not use **undersampling** as a technique to address data bias. Additionally, while the study mentions the use of random points, it does not explicitly mention **stratified splitting** as a technique used to address data bias.

Overall, the study used a combination of diverse data collection, oversampling, and stratified sampling to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
