The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, except for one instance where it mentions an "event-based F-score". This suggests that the F-score is used as an evaluation measure, but it does not provide information on other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. 

However, it is worth noting that the context provides a list of numbers with confidence intervals, which could be related to the evaluation of the model's performance. But without more information, it is difficult to determine what these numbers represent. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only metric that can be confirmed is the event-based F-score.
