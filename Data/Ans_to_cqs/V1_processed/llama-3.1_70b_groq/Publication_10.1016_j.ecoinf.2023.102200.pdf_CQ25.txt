The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context is primarily for segmentation and classification tasks. 

In the context of wetlands classification, Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) used a deep convolutional neural network for classification. 

For individual tree crown segmentation, Chen et al. (2021) used the PointNet of deep learning directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data. Similarly, Martins et al. (2021) used machine learning and SLIC for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas. 

In the context of mangrove tree segmentation, Marasigan et al. (2019) used a marker-controlled watershed algorithm, but the discussion also mentions the use of deep learning (DL) for segmentation research. 

Additionally, the BEV Faster R-CNN algorithm was used for segmentation, as shown in Figure 9 and Table 6, which present the segmentation results and statistics for low-density, medium-density, and high-density sites. 

Overall, the deep learning models are used for segmentation and classification tasks, such as identifying individual trees, classifying wetlands, and segmenting tree canopies.
