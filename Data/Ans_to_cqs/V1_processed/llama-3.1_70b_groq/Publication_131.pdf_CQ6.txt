The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation as a preprocessing step.

Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data. In the context of audio classification, data augmentation involves applying transformations to the audio samples, such as modifying the pitch, tempo, or adding noise, to generate new samples. This helps to increase the diversity of the training data and can improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In the provided context, data augmentation is applied to the audio samples by generating 10 additional audios for each of the 865 audio samples in the database. The transformations applied to the audio samples are not specified, but it is mentioned that these transformations are reflected in the mel-spectrogram images.

It is likely that other preprocessing steps, such as normalization or scaling, were applied to the data before training the deep learning model, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
