Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses the training methods (supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised), the importance of labeled data, and the benefits of using certain models (such as JESS) for image segmentation tasks. It also mentions the problem of unstable training in Joint Energy-Based models, but it does not provide information on how model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
