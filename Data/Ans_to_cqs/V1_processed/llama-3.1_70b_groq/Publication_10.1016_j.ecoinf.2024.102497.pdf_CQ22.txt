Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts related to bathymetry retrieval methods, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
