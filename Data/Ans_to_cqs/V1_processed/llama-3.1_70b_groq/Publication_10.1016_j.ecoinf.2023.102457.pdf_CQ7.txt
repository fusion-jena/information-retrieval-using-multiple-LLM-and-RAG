Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the potential of deep learning models for feature extraction and classification, and mentions the use of a pre-trained BirdNET model, but it does not provide information on data splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
