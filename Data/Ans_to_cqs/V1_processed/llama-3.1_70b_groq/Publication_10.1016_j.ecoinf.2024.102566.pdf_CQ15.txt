I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to forest biomass estimation using remote sensing and machine learning methods, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
