The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention that a min-max scaler was used and reverted at the end to compute the performance metrics in the test set. This suggests that some form of performance evaluation or metrics calculation was performed after training, but the specific details of the postprocessing steps are not provided.
