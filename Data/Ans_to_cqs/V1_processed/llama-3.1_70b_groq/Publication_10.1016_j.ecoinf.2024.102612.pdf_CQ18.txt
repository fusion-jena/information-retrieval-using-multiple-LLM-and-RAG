Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context mainly discusses the methodology for fuel model retrieval, the use of a deep learning (DL) model trained with synthetic data, and the validation of the model using real MS point clouds. It also mentions the decision tree scheme for retrieving final fuel models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
