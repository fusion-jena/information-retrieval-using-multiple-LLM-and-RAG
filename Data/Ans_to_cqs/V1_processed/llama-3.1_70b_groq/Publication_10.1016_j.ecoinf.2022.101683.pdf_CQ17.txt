Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, model evaluation, and spatial analysis, but it does not mention deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I must answer that I don't know what regularization methods are used in this specific context, as it is not mentioned in the provided text.
