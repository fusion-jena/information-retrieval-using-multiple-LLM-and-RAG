The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a ground-truth imagery dataset and evaluated against a test dataset. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the colour channels of the images were normalised by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviations per channel, based on the ImageNet dataset used in the training of the (pre-trained) RestNet-50. This suggests that the model was pre-trained on a large and diverse dataset (ImageNet), which can help improve its generalizability.

However, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
