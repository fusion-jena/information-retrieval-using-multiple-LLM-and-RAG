The provided context does not specifically mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of early stopping as a technique to prevent overfitting. Early stopping is a regularization method that stops the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a learning rate, also known as a shrinkage parameter, which determines the contribution of each tree to the model. A low learning rate can help prevent overfitting by reducing the impact of each individual tree on the overall model.

It's worth noting that the context appears to be discussing Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models, which are a type of ensemble learning method. The regularization methods used in GBRT may differ from those used in deep learning pipelines.
