The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization of hyperparameters using grid search, random search, or any other method. However, it does mention the use of the "optidisc" function from the "GD" package in RStudio to select the optimal parameters for discretizing continuous data. This suggests that the model uses a specific method to optimize the discretization parameters, but the exact method is not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the analysis revealed that the 90% quantile of the Q-values for each driver reaches its maximum at the 2 km * 2 km grid scale, followed by a decreasing trend. This suggests that the model uses a grid-based approach to optimize the spatial scale, but it is not clear if this is equivalent to a grid search.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the exact method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
