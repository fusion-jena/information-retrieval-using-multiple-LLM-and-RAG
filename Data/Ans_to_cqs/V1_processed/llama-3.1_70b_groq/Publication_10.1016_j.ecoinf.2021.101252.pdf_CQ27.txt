Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of AutoML to generate and train candidate models, and the evaluation of their performance using accuracy and AUC metrics. It also mentions the time taken to train the models on different hardware configurations, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
