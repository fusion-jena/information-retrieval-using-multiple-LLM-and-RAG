The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include:

1. Pixel-wise salient object annotations: This involves manually segmenting all salient trunks in each image to obtain pixel-wise annotations.
2. Bounding box annotation: This is mentioned as one of the annotation techniques used in other datasets, but it is not explicitly stated as being used in the ST-D dataset.
3. Homogeneous objects and monotonous background annotation: This is mentioned as a characteristic of some datasets, but it is not clear if it is a specific annotation technique used in the ST-D dataset.

It is also mentioned that the dataset was annotated by manually segmenting all salient trunks in each image, and then the images were divided into a training set and a testing set using a ratio of 65% to 35% respectively.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset features good diversity, including diverse tree trunk sizes, which is beneficial to train the SOD models and evaluate their generalization performance.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, and some techniques might be missing.
