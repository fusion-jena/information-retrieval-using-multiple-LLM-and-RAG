Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training process of a deep learning model for bird species classification, including the use of wav2vec and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. It also discusses the benefits of transfer learning and the effectiveness of deep learning in classifying birds based on their calls.

However, it does mention the use of a quantization module and a diversity loss function during the pre-training phase of wav2vec, which may help regularize the model and reduce the impact of randomness. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a linear projection layer and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss during the fine-tuning phase, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
