The provided context does not explicitly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few techniques that can be related to addressing data bias.

One technique mentioned is "balanced sampling" for the test set. The context states that for the test set, one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of five was selected for each type of anuran call. This suggests that the authors attempted to balance the test set to ensure that each class is represented equally.

Another technique mentioned is data augmentation. The context states that for each of the 865 audio samples in the database, 10 additional audios were generated through transformations. This can help to increase the diversity of the training data and potentially reduce bias.

However, the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. It also does not discuss diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that balanced sampling and data augmentation are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is not possible to confirm the use of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
