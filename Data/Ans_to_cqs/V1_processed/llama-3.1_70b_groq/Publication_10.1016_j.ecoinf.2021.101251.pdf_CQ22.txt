I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their performance metrics. It appears to be discussing data repositories, citation metrics, and data stewardship, which is unrelated to the query. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to the question about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.
