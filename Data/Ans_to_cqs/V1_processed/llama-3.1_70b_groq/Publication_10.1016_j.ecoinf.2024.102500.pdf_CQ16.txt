Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and the importance of hyperparameter selection in improving model performance. It discusses the use of cross-validation, grid search, and random search methods for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
