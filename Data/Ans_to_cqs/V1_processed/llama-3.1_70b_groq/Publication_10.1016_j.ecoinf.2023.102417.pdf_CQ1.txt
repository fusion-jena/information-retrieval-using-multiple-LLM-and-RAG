The context mentions that the data collection methods for biocrust monitoring can change over time, and different camera devices can record data differently. It also mentions that multispectral or hyperspectral images can be used as input for deep learning models, but these approaches are heavily dependent on cost-intensive airborne data acquisition. For low-cost remote sensing biocrust monitoring, manual data acquisition by humans is used. Additionally, the context mentions that camera devices can perform automated post-processing, which can affect the data.

It appears that the primary method of collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is through camera devices, specifically for collecting image data. The context does not mention surveys or public datasets as methods of data collection. It does mention that multispectral or hyperspectral sensors can be used, but these are not the primary method of data collection in this specific pipeline.
