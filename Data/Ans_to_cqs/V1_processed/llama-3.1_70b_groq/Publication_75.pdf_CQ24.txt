The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention that the network architecture, SeedNet, is used for seed image classification and retrieval tasks. The name "SeedNet" might suggest a connection to random seed values, but this is not explicitly stated.

The context does mention that the network is trained on two different datasets, the Canadian and the local dataset, which might imply that the training process is repeated multiple times with different initializations or random seeds to evaluate the robustness of the model. However, this is not explicitly stated.

In general, deep learning pipelines often employ strategies such as fixing the random seed value, using techniques like data augmentation, or using ensemble methods to handle randomness and improve the robustness of the model. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine if these strategies are employed in the specific context of the provided text.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
