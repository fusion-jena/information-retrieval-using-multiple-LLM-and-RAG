The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the model in predicting the Trophic State Index (TSI) based on the input parameters aCDOM(254) and Fn(355). The R2 value measures the goodness of fit of the model, while the RMSE measures the difference between the predicted and actual values of TSI.
