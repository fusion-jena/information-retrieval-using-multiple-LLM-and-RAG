Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on habitat classification and mapping, with discussions on data preparation, harmonization, and post-classification refinement. It mentions the use of a random grid search approach to fine-tune model parameters, but it does not provide further details on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
