Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. In fact, the context mentions that Deneu et al. (2022) used a convolutional neural network to model the distribution of species, but it does not provide information on how the model was trained or validated.

However, the context does mention that the authors used UMAP to analyze the similarity between a target species and its environment, and that they computed the nearest neighbor Euclidean distance between species-species and background-species. They also calculated the cumulative empirical distribution function of the intra-species distance. But these measures are related to the UMAP analysis, not to the deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the context.
