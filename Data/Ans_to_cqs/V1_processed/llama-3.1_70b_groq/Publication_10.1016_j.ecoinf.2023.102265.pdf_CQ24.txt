Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of pre-trained ResNet models for image classification, feature extraction, and the comparison of different model variants (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101). It also discusses the use of a t-SNE algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data, but it does not address the topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
