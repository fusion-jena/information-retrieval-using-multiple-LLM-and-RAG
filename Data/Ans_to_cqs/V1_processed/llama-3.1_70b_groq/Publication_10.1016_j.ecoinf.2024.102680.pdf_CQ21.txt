The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics and their calculations.

According to the context, the evaluation metrics used are Precision, Recall, and AP (Average Precision). The formulas for Precision and Recall are provided as:

Precision = TP / (FP + TP)
Recall = TP / (FN + TP)

The context also mentions the calculation of AP, which is the average of the precision values at different recall levels.

AP = 1/M * âˆ‘[AP(i)] from i=1 to M

where AP(i) is the precision value at recall level i, and M is the number of recall levels.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a structural diagram of the LKSP module (Fig. 8) and a table of detailed descriptions of the evaluation metrics (Table 1). However, the actual postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as generating saliency maps or calculating confusion matrices, are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only provide information on the evaluation metrics used, but not on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
