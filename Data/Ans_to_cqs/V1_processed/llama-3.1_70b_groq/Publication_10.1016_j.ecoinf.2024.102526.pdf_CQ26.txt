Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental monitoring, data collection, and image annotation, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline preprocessing.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of underrepresented class samples to balance the dataset.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of samples from overrepresented classes to balance the dataset.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources or environments to reduce bias.

These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address data bias and improve model performance. However, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.

If you have any further questions or would like more information on these techniques, please let me know!
