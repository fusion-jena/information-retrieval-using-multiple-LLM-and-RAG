Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper or report discussing a model, possibly a hydrological or environmental model, and its parameters, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
