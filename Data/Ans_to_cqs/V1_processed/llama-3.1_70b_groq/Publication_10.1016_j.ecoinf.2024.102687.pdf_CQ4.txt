Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that supervised-based methods rely on data augmentation to create image pairs that can be used to build training tasks (Khodadadeh et al., 2019), but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
