Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on land surface temperature (LST) retrieval, land use land cover (LULC) mapping, and the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modeling and prediction. It mentions the MODIS-TERRA sensor and the MOD11A2 product, which is used to derive the LST dataset, but it does not mention any specific deep learning datasets. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
