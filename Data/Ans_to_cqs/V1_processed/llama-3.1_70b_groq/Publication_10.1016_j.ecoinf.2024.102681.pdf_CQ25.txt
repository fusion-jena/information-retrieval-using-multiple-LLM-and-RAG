The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the CNN-LSTM hybrid model, is to predict drought propagation time and understand the influencing factors on drought propagation. The model is designed to process a comprehensive dataset that includes various influencing factors and a drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020. The model's architecture is shown in Fig. 2, and it is used to delve deeper into the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propagation. The model's prediction accuracy on the testing set has improved by about 20% compared to the original CNN, indicating its effectiveness in predicting drought propagation time.
