Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text primarily focuses on the data augmentation techniques, model architecture, and training configuration for the birdsong classification task. It also discusses the use of pre-trained weights, focal loss, and the impact of augmentation techniques on model performance.

However, it does mention the evaluation of model performance, including the calculation of metrics and the comparison of training and testing times (Table 3). But it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
