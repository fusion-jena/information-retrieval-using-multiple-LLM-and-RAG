Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and forestry, discussing the use of Sentinel-2 data to estimate above-ground biomass density (AGBD) and the selection of spectral bands as predictors for a model. There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
