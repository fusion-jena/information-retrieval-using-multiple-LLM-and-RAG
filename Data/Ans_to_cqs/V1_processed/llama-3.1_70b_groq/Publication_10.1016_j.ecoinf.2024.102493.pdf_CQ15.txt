I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to geographical data analysis, specifically the use of the "GD" package in RStudio for Optimal Parameter-based Geographical Detector (OPGD) analysis. It discusses the selection of optimal parameters for discretizing continuous data, the use of different discretization methods, and the analysis of driver interactions. However, it does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
