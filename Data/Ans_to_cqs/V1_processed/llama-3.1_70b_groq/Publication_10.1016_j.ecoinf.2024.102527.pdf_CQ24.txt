Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text only mentions that the authors "randomly extracted capture events" and "randomly selected events" to create training sets, but it does not provide information on how they handled randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
