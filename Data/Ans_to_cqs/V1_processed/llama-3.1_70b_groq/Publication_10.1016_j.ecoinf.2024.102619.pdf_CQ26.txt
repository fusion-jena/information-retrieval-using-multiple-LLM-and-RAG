According to the provided context, the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: The images in each dataset were split into 80% training (including 5-fold cross-validation) and 20% testing subsets, with splits stratified to preserve the class-ratio. This means that the proportion of each class in the training and testing sets is the same as in the original dataset.

No other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are mentioned in the provided context as being used to address data bias. However, it is mentioned that class imbalance can be handled by down-weighting common classes or up-sampling rare classes, but this is not explicitly stated as being done in the preprocessing pipeline.

Therefore, the only technique explicitly mentioned as being used to address data bias is stratified splitting.
