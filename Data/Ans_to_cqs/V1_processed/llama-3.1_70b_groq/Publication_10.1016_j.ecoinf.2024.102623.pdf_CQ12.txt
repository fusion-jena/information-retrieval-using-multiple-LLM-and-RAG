The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture. Specifically, it consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons, connected with residual connections, and using batch normalization and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function in all layers except the final one, where a sigmoid function is used for multi-label classification.
