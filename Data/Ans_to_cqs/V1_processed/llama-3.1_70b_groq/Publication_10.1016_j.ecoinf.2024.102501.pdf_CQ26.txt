The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does discuss data preprocessing methods used to handle issues with the data, such as normalization (Eq. 1) and standardization (Eq. 2), to reduce the impact of large differences in dimension and magnitude values of various parameters.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of clustering algorithms to group datasets with different periodic changes, which can help to identify and handle potential biases in the data. It also mentions the use of techniques such as empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform (WT) for denoising and feature extraction, which can help to reduce the impact of noise and biases in the data.

However, it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias, such as those mentioned in the query. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
