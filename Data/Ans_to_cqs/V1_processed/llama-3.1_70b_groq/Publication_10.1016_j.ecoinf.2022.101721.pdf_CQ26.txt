Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to acoustic analysis of bat calls and statistical modeling, but it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into subsets based on the class labels to ensure that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class.
* Oversampling: creating additional copies of the minority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: reducing the number of majority class samples to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources or environments to reduce bias in the data.

These techniques can help to reduce data bias and improve the performance of deep learning models. However, the specific techniques used may depend on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed.

In the context of the provided text, there is no mention of deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias. The text appears to be focused on statistical modeling and acoustic analysis of bat calls.
