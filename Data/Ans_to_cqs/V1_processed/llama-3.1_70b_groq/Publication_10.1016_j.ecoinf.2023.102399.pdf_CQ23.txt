Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning models, specifically YOLO (You Only Look Once), for object detection and estimation tasks. It provides various tables and figures showing the performance of the models, but it does not discuss the methods used to ensure generalizability.

However, it is common practice in deep learning research to use techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, and diverse datasets to ensure the generalizability of models. But without explicit mention in the provided context, it is impossible to say for certain what measures were taken in this specific case.
