Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the design and implementation of a database schema for a system called CASE, as well as the creation of a multidimensional spatial cube called Captures. There is no mention of deep learning models or any efforts to ensure their generalizability.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
