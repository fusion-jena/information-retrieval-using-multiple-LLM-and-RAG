I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text only mentions that a deep learning model is combined with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming (Do, A.N.T., Tran, H.D., 2023). However, it does not provide information on the architecture of the deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
