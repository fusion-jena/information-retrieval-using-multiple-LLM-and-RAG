Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for land use and land cover (LULC) classification and mapping. It highlights the advantages of deep learning, including automatic feature extraction, adaptability to evolving patterns, and compatibility with new situations or study areas.

While data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization, the specific techniques used in this context are not mentioned. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
