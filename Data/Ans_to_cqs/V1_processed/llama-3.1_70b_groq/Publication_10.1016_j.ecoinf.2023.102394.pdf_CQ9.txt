Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The references listed appear to be citations for various research papers and studies, but none of them seem to point to a specific data repository.

However, some of the references mention specific datasets, such as TerraClimate and a dataset of carbon density in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems. These datasets may be available through the cited references or through online data repositories, but the exact location is not specified in the provided context.

If you are looking for the data repository for the deep learning pipeline, you may want to try searching online for the specific dataset or study mentioned in the context, or try contacting the authors of the study directly to inquire about the availability of the data.
