Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and AdaBoost, to predict water quality parameters in reservoirs using satellite imagery data from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI.

The context mentions various scientific papers and research studies related to water quality modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
