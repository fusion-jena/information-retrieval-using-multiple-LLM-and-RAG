Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline of BirdNET, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions that BirdNET uses a deep neural network for the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
