According to the provided context, measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The authors mention that they "performed data augmentation on the training the model including varying lighting conditions that ensure it represents seasonal or daily variations in the conditions." This suggests that the dataset was augmented to include diverse lighting conditions, which can help improve the model's robustness to different environmental conditions.

Additionally, the authors mention that the work was carried out on "very different regions that are representative of many different environments across Europe." This implies that the dataset was diverse in terms of geographic locations and environments, which can help improve the model's generalizability to different regions.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Overall, while some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as data augmentation and using a diverse dataset, it is unclear whether other measures like cross-validation and stratified splitting were used.
