Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to forest biomass estimation using remote sensing and machine learning algorithms. While some of the papers mention the use of machine learning algorithms, such as regression models, they do not provide details on the optimization of hyperparameters.

However, one of the papers mentions the use of the "regsubsets" function in the R package "leaps" to select the explanatory variables for the model. This suggests that the authors may have used a subset selection method to select the most relevant variables for the model, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters.

Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, as this information is not provided in the context.
