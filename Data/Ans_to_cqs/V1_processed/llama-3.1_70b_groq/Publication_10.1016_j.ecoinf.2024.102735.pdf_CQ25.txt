The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context, such as Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), is to predict algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a, phyco-cyanin, algal cells, and toxins. These models are used for regression tasks, specifically to predict continuous values related to Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) monitoring and prediction. The models aim to identify patterns between water quality parameters and ecosystem variables to make predictions about algal-related parameters.
