The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the sources of remote sensing data used in the study, which include:

* The Google Earth Engine platform, which provides planetary-level cloud computing and rich remote sensing data.
* The 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI).
* The daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI).
* The third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI).
* The SPOT/VEGETATION products (SPOT NDVI).

These datasets are likely collected using satellite sensors, but the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified in the provided context.
