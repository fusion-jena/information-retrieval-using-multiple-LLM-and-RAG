The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does describe the data augmentation techniques used to enhance the training set, which include:

* Flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis
* Exchanging between multiple image channels while keeping the labels unchanged
* Randomly rotating the images and labels by 90 degrees
* Randomly adding noise to the images while keeping the labels unchanged

These techniques introduce randomness into the training process, but the context does not mention how this randomness is controlled or whether a random seed value is set. Therefore, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
