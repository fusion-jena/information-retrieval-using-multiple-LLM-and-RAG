Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves remote sensing (RS) imagery, specifically satellite data from Landsat-8, which is obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The context also mentions the use of six bands of data: blue, green, red, near-infrared, and two shortwave infrared bands, as well as a quality assurance (QA) band for identifying and removing clouds and shadows.

While the context does not explicitly mention the data format, it is likely that the satellite data is in a raster format, such as GeoTIFF or JPEG2000, which are common formats for satellite imagery. Additionally, the context mentions the use of vegetation index feature datasets, which may be in a CSV or other tabular format. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
