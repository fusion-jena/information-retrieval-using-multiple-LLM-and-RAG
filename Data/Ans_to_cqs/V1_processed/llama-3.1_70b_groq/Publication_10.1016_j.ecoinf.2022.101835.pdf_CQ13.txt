The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, are as follows:

* Number of middle layers (n_layers): 0 (i.e., no intermediate layers)
* Number of nodes in the input layer (units (initial layer)): 90
* Number of nodes in the middle layers (units (middle layers)): 60
* Activation function in the input and middle layers (activation): ReLu
* Optimizer: Adam

Note that the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the optimizer used is Adam, which is a popular stochastic gradient descent optimizer that adapts the learning rate for each parameter.

Additionally, the context mentions that the hyperparameters were optimized using Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework, with the parameters and ranges shown in Table 1 as candidates.
