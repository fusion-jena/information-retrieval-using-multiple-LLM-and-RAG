The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does provide the loss values for the training and validation datasets during Mask R-CNN training, which can be used to evaluate the model's performance.

The loss values mentioned include:

* Loss: 0.8241
* RPN class loss: 0.3679
* RPN bounding box loss: 0.4562
* MRCNN class loss: 3.1710e-06
* MRCNN bounding box loss: 0.0000e+00
* MRCNN mask loss: 0.6051
* Validation RPN bounding box loss: 0.1993
* Validation RPN class loss: 0.4057
* Validation MRCNN bounding box loss: 0.0000e+00
* Validation MRCNN class loss: 0.0000e+00
* Validation MRCNN mask loss: 3.2186e-06

These loss values can be used to evaluate the model's performance, but they do not provide a direct measure of accuracy, precision, or recall. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned, but the loss values provided can be used as a proxy to evaluate the model's performance.
