I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the performance of various object detection algorithms on the URPC 2020 dataset, with a focus on underwater object detection. The paper presents experimental results and discusses the limitations of existing methods, but it does not provide a link to a code repository.
