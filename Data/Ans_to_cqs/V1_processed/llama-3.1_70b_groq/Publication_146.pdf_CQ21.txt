The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the training evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mAP, which are calculated from the model validation data. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

The context only mentions the calculation of training metrics at different iteration stages, as shown in Table 2, but it does not elaborate on any further postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
