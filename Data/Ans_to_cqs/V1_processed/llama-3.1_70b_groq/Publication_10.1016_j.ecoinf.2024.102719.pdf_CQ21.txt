Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the modeling procedure, including the use of various machine learning models, hyperparameter optimization using TPE algorithms, and bias-variance decomposition.

However, it does mention that the predictions of the trained models on the testing dataset were averaged to obtain the main prediction, and the average loss, average bias, and average variance were then derived for each model. This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation was performed, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query regarding the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
