I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to a study on the relationship between negative air ions and environmental factors, using techniques such as multiple linear regression and random forest models. The context mentions the use of R statistical software, but does not provide information on optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
