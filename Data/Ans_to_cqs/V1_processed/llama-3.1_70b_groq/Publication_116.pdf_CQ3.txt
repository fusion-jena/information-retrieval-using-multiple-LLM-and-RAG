Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various deep learning concepts, architectures, and papers, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. It only mentions that two pipelines are used to classify leaf-scan images into species, one using a traditional hand-crafted feature extraction approach and the other using a deep learning approach. However, the details of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not provided.
