The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is based on validation loss. The model was trained for a large number of epochs (roughly 4 days), and the best model was selected based on the minimal validation loss that occurred at epoch 448. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set was continuously monitored during training, and the model with the lowest validation loss was chosen as the best-performing model. Additionally, the training loss and accuracy, as well as the validation loss and accuracy, were tracked during training, which provided further insights into the model's performance.
