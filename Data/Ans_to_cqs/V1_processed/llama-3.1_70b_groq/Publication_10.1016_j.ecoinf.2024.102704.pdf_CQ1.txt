Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few instances where data collection is mentioned:

* Coro and Walsh (2021) proposed an underwater detector for monitoring the size of key indicator species in marine fish, suggesting the use of underwater video devices for data collection.
* da Cunha et al. (2023) mention the selection of fish resources for consumption and sale by artisanal fishers, but it is unclear if this involves data collection for a deep learning pipeline.
* Palmer et al. mention high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings, but the method of data collection is not specified.

It can be inferred that some methods of data collection might include:

* Underwater video devices (Coro and Walsh, 2021)
* Surveys or interviews with artisanal fishers (da Cunha et al., 2023)
* High-resolution monitoring of fish landings (Palmer et al.)

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
