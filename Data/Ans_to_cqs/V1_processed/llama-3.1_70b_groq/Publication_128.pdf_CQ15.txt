Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization technique for training classification. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses the backpropagation algorithm to update the model. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled examples, The model is trained on the dataset and the model makes predictions on the dataset. The model is trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which is a type of stochastic gradient descent. The model is trained on the dataset and the model makes predictions of the the dataset. The model is trained using the backpropagation algorithm to make the model.
