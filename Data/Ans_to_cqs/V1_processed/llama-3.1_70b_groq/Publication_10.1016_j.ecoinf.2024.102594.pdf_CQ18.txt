The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of the ReduceLROnPlateau callback. Specifically, if the validation loss value does not decrease after 5 consecutive epochs, the learning rate is halved. Additionally, if there is no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive epochs, the training process is terminated. This approach allows for dynamic adjustment of the learning rate and early stopping of the training process if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve.
