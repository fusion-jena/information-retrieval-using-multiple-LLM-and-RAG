The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the datasets are divided into training set and test set according to the ratio of 8:2, which suggests that the model was trained on a large portion of the data and evaluated on a smaller, separate portion. This is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the text mentions that the number of test samples and training samples are 3094 and 12,340, respectively, which suggests that the dataset is relatively large and diverse. However, it does not provide information on whether the data was stratified or if cross-validation was used.

Therefore, while the text provides some information on the dataset and the evaluation methodology, it does not provide a complete picture of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
