Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the training process, including the optimization techniques, learning rates, and data augmentation methods used for action recognition and object detection tasks. It also mentions the use of PyTorch for building and training the networks, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
