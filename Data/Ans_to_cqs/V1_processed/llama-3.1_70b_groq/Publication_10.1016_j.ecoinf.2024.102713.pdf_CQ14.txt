Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization or model training. The context appears to be related to the design and functionality of a system called CASE, which is used for collecting and analyzing data through questionnaires. It also mentions a multidimensional spatial cube called Captures, but it does not provide any information about machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, as this information is not present in the provided context.
