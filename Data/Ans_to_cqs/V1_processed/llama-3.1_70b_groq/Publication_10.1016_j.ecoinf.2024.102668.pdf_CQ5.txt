Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to audio recordings and acoustic analysis, discussing the use of different recording devices (SongMeter and AudioMoth) and their settings (e.g., sampling frequency and gain). It also touches on the topic of reducing device bias in acoustic recordings and the applicability of indices for broader comparative analyses. However, it does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
