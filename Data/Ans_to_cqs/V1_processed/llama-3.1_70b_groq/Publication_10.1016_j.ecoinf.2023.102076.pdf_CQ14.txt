Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the data collection, preprocessing, and filtering steps, as well as the use of BERT for text classification, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
