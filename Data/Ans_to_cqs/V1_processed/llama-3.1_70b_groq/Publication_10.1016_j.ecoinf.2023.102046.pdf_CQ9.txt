Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the models used (ResNet-50, Inception-V3, CLIP), their architectures, and the training process, but does not provide information about where the data is stored or shared.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
