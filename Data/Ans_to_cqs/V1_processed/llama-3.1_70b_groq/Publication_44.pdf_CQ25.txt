The purpose of the deep learning model described in the context is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the mention of a "fully convolution neural network for semantic segmentation" in Figure 2, which consists of an encoder part that extracts useful features and a decoder part that up-samples the extracted feature map to produce the final segmentation results. Additionally, the text mentions that the model is used for "pixel-level classification" and "leaf extraction", which further supports the idea that the model is designed for semantic segmentation tasks.
