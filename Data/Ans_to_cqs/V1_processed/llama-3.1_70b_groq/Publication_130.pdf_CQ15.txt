Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that having large datasets will allow optimizing performance of CNNs, but it does not specify the optimization techniques used. It also mentions that different hyper-parameters settings (e.g. learning rate) can yield different results, but it does not provide further details on the optimization techniques applied.
