Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to focus on the architecture and layers of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image classification tasks, as well as the shapes and types of the tensors and vectors used in the models. It does not provide information on data splitting or the proportions used for training, testing, and validation sets. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
