Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN), the data collection process, and the training procedures, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

The text only mentions that the model was trained on a dataset with a size of 32, but it does not elaborate on how the data was preprocessed or augmented. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
