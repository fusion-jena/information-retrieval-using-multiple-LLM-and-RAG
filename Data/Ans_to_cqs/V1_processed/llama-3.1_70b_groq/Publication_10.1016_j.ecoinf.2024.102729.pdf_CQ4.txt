Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context appears to be focused on various studies and research papers related to water quality management, environmental pollution, and machine learning applications in these fields. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
