The study utilizes social media data as the primary source of raw data for the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the study collects relevant reviews with images from the Weibo, Dianping, and Ctrip platforms for 57 traditional villages. This approach allows the researchers to gather a large dataset of images and text content, which is then processed using the HRNet model for semantic segmentation and an NLP model based on the LSTM-CNN framework for sentiment analysis.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used as methods for collecting raw data in the provided context. The study relies solely on social media data as the primary source of information.
