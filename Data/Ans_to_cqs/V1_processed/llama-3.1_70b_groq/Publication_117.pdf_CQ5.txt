The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are the COCO dataset and a custom dataset created from survey images. The COCO dataset, provided by Lin et al. (2014), is used as a pre-trained model for the YOLO DCNN. Additionally, a custom dataset is created by selecting 500 survey images at random, tiling them into 864 Ã— 864 subimages, and passing them through the YOLO DCNN to create a list of potential object locations. This custom dataset is then filtered using the Zooniverse data. There is no mention of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets being used in the deep learning pipeline.
