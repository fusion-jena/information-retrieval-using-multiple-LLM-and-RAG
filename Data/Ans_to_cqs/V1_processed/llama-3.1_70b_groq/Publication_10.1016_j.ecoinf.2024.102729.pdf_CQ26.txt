Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning in water quality management, environmental pollution, and phytoplankton dynamics.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Common techniques used to address data bias include:

* Stratified splitting: This involves splitting the data into subsets based on the target variable, ensuring that each subset has a similar distribution of classes.
* Oversampling: This involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the dataset.
* Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the dataset.
* Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.

It's worth noting that these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, and I'm not aware of any specific techniques used to address data bias in the context of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
