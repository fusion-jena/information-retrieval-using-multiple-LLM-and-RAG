To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the researchers proposed a data augmentation method to train the two-stage CNNs. This method was designed to be generally applicable under various camera or field conditions. Additionally, the researchers applied random erasing to the training dataset of the EfficientNet, which moderately improved performance. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability.
