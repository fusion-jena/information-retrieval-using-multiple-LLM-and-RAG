The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned in Table 1 that the splitting of the GBIFm dataset is approximately 20% for validation and 80% for training, and the splitting of the TLm dataset is approximately 16% for validation and 84% for training. This suggests that the data is split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or method used for splitting is not specified.
