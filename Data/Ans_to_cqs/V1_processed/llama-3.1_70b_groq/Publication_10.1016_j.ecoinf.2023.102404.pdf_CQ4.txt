Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in remote sensing, specifically for tasks like canopy height mapping, crop growth monitoring, and biomass estimation.

However, I can provide some general information on data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. Common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping (horizontal and vertical)
* Rotating (by a certain angle)
* Scaling (up or down)
* Color jittering (changing brightness, contrast, saturation)
* Noise injection (adding random noise to the data)

These techniques help to increase the diversity of the training data, reduce overfitting, and improve the robustness of the model.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to the query.
