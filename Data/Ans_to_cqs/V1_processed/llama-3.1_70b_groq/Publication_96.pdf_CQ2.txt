The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Landsat 8 imagery, which consists of eleven spectral bands with different spatial resolutions. This suggests that the pipeline likely uses image data, specifically multispectral or hyperspectral image data, as input for the deep learning models. Additionally, the context mentions the use of spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas, which further supports the use of image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
