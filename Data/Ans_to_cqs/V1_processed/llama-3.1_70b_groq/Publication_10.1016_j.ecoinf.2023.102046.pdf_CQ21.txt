Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix, etc. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different models (CLIP, ViT, Inception) on image classification tasks, their training curves, and comparisons of their accuracy. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that may have been performed after the model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
