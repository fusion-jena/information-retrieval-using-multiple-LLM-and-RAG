The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is regression, specifically for forecasting algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery. The study uses two types of deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, as well as a hybrid model that combines both CNN and LSTM. The models are trained to predict the concentration of chlorophyll, which is an indicator of algal blooms. The study aims to use satellite data to forecast algal blooms, and the deep learning models are used to extract features from the data and make predictions. The output layer of the models is a regression output layer, indicating that the purpose of the model is to predict a continuous value, in this case, the concentration of chlorophyll.
