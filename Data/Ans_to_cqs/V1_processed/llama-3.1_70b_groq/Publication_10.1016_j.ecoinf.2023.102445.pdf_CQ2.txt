The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves image data. The text mentions "input image" (X) and "output image" (Y) in the context of the Conv2d operation, and also refers to "feature maps" which is a common term used in image processing and computer vision. Additionally, the text mentions "video acquisition" in section 2.1.2, suggesting that video data may also be involved in the pipeline. However, the specific formats of these data types (e.g., JPEG, PNG, MP4, etc.) are not mentioned.
