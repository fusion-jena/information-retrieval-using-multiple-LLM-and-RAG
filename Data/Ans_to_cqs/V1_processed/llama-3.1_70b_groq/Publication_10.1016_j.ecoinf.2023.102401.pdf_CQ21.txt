The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation of the model's performance using various metrics.

According to the context, the performance of the trained model is evaluated by computing metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and other relevant measures (Step 3). The context also provides tables comparing the performance of different models and attention modules using metrics like mAp, mAp50-95, P, R, and F1.

While the context does not provide a detailed description of the postprocessing steps, it implies that metrics calculation is an essential part of the evaluation process. However, it does not mention saliency maps or confusion matrix explicitly.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that metrics calculation is involved in the postprocessing steps, but the context does not provide information on saliency maps or confusion matrix.
