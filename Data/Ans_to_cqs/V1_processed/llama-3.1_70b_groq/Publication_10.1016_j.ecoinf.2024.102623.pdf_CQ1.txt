Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in ecological research, specifically in species distribution modeling (SDMs), and discusses the advantages and performance of these methods.

However, it does mention the use of remote sensing in the context of the Geolifeclef 2023 challenge, which involves species composition prediction with high spatial resolution at a continental scale. This suggests that remote sensing data may be one of the data sources used in the pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of presence-only and presence-absence datasets, which may be collected through various methods such as surveys, field observations, or citizen science initiatives. However, the specific methods used for collecting these datasets are not mentioned.

Therefore, while we can infer that remote sensing data may be one of the data sources used, the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context.
