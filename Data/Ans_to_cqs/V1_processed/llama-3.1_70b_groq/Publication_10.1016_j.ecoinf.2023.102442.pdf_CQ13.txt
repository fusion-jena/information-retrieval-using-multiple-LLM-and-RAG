I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models for detecting artisanal small-scale mining and land use/land cover classification, but it does not provide details on the model architecture or hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
