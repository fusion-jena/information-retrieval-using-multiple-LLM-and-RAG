Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are one of the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the references to camera trap data, camera trap studies, and the use of camera traps for collecting data on wildlife, such as the yellow-billed oxpeckers roosting on their large mammalian hosts.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of line transect census and track surveys as methods for collecting data, as mentioned in the paper by Silveira et al. (2003). However, it is not clear if these methods are directly related to the deep learning pipeline.

There is also a mention of the SS project, which seems to be a large-scale project that has collected millions of labeled data points. However, the context does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting this data.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is possible that other methods, such as sensors or public datasets, may also be used, but this information is not available in the provided context.
