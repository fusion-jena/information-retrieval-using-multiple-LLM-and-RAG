Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on various aspects of deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks, object detection, and fish biomass estimation, but does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

However, I can provide some general information on common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training and validation sets while maintaining the same proportion of each class in both sets.
* Oversampling: increasing the number of instances of the minority class to match the number of instances of the majority class.
* Undersampling: decreasing the number of instances of the majority class to match the number of instances of the minority class.
* Diverse data collection: collecting more data from diverse sources to reduce bias in the dataset.

Please note that this information is not derived from the provided context, but rather from general knowledge of machine learning techniques.

If you're looking for specific information on techniques used to address data bias in the context of fish biomass estimation or other specific applications, I would recommend searching for relevant research papers or articles that focus on those topics.
