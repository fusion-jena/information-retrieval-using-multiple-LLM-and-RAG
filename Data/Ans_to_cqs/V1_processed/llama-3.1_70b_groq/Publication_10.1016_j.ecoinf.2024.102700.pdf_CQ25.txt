I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific purpose of the deep learning model. It only mentions that deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, have been used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide information on the specific task or application of these models. The context primarily focuses on the types of modeling approaches used in the examined articles, the trends in their usage over the years, and the incorporation of anthropogenic variables in modeling.
