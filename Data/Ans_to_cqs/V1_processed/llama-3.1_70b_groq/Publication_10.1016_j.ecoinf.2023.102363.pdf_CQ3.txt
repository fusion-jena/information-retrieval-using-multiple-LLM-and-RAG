Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of pre-trained models, transfer learning, and fine-tuning of fully connected layers for classification tasks. It also mentions the use of spectrograms as image inputs for audio data, but it does not provide information on how the data was annotated. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
