Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the integration of machine learning with satellite data interpretation, the development of algorithms for atmospheric correction, and the estimation of Chl-a concentrations. It does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
