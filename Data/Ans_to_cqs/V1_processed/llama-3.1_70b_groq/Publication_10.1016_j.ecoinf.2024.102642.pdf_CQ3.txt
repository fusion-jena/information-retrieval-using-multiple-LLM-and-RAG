The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the annotation of cetacean vocalizations in underwater sound events, and the methods used to aggregate and improve the quality of annotations.

However, it does mention the use of spectrograms to represent the data to annotators, and the importance of considering the temporal context of the sound events. It also discusses the use of majority voting and soft labeling as methods to aggregate annotations from multiple annotators.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide specific information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, but it does mention the use of spectrograms and annotation aggregation methods.
