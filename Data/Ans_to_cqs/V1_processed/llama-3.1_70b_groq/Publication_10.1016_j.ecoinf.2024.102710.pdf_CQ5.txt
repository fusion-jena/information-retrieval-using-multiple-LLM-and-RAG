The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

1. ImageNet: a large image dataset used for pre-training CNNs such as ResNet152-V2 and VGG16.
2. AudioSet: a large acoustic dataset used for pre-training CNNs such as VGGish and YAMNet.
3. AnuraSet: a dataset used for testing the performance of different embedding models, but no further information is provided about this dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that BirdNet was trained on data from the target modality (audio) and a related domain (bird vocalisations from focal recordings, also annotated at species level), but it does not specify the exact dataset used.

It is also mentioned that some studies used other datasets such as:

* Macaulay Library: a dataset gathered from online resources used for training small networks from scratch.
* Focal and citizen-science datasets: used for evaluating the performance of models pre-trained on audio data.
* YouTube sound clips: a dataset from the same target modality (audio) but a different domain, used for pre-training VGGish and YAMNet.

However, it is not clear if these datasets are part of the deep learning pipeline or just used for evaluation or training purposes.
