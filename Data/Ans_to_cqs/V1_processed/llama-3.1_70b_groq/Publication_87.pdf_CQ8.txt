Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or a tutorial that discusses the use of deep learning for species identification in ecological communities, but it does not provide information on where the code is hosted. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
