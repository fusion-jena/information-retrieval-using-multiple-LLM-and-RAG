The method utilized for collecting raw data in this study is through the Twitter API, specifically the 'Full-archive search endpoint'. This endpoint allows access to the entire dataset published on Twitter from its beginning in 2006-2007 until the end of 2022. The Twitter API is used to search for words, hashtags, or combinations of both in the text of tweets. The search is performed using three different criteria: (i) tweets in which users ask "who knows" or if "anyone knows" what they have found, (ii) tweets that directly ask "what is this" that they have found, and (iii) tweets from users claiming to have found something, with textual expression as "I/we have found". The data is returned in JSON format and is handled using the twarc2 library.
