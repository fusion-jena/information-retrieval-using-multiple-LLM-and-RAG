I don't know. The provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters or the use of techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be focused on the use of UAV-derived datasets to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) in a Pinus sylvestris forest, and the discussion of the results and implications of the study. There is no mention of model optimization or hyperparameter tuning.
