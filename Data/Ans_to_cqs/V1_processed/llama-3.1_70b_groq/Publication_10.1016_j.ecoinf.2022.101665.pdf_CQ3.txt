Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on statistical methods for evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps, specifically in the context of machine learning and spatial statistics. It discusses techniques such as random division of datasets into training, validation, and test sets, resampling methods, and inverse sampling-intensity weighting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as it is not addressed in the provided context.
