Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that "Data augmentation was only applied to the training dataset" but does not provide further details on the techniques used.

However, it does mention that the segments obtained from data augmentation were "randomly distributed between the training and validation sets with a ratio 0.8/0.2", which suggests that some form of randomization was involved in the data augmentation process. But without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
