Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the architecture and training of the IUC-NN model, including the use of cross-validation and the selection of the model with the lowest cross-entropy loss, but it does not provide information on specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.
