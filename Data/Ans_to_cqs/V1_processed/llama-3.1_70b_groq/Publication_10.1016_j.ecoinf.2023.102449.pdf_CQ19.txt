Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text only describes the architecture of the model, including the use of wide residual networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs), but does not mention the framework used to implement these components. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
