Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the YOLOv5 model, which is a real-time object detection system. Typically, YOLOv5 uses bounding box annotation, where the model is trained to predict bounding boxes around objects of interest.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Haar classifier for detecting and identifying the head and mouth of fish in underwater images. This suggests that the dataset may have been annotated with specific regions of interest (ROIs) or keypoints, but the exact annotation technique is not specified.

Instance segmentation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but it is possible that it may have been used in conjunction with other techniques to achieve the goal of fully automatic biomass estimation.

Overall, while we can make some educated guesses about the possible data annotation techniques used, the exact techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
