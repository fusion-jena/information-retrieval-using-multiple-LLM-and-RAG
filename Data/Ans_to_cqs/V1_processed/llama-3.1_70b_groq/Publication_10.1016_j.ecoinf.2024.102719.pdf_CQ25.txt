The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the deep learning models are being used for river health predictions, specifically for predicting the health of rivers in unmonitored areas. The models are being evaluated for their generalizability to unseen data, which suggests that the purpose of the models is to make predictions or classifications about river health based on environmental factors. The specific task of the models, such as classification, segmentation, or detection, is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
