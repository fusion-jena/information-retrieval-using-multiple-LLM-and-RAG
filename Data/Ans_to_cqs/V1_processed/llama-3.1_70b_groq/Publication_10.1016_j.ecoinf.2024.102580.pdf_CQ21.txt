Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training. The section 3.3 "Post-processing of output" is mentioned, but it only provides information about the spatial patterns within seagrass meadow ecosystem and does not elaborate on the specific post-processing steps.

However, it is mentioned that the model's performance is evaluated, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated (Fig. 6). This suggests that some form of metrics calculation is involved in the post-processing steps, but the exact details are not provided.

Regarding saliency maps and confusion matrices, there is no mention of these in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know if these are part of the post-processing steps involved after model training.
