Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to focus on the use of various statistical algorithms (GAM, ANN, RF, GBM) for interpolating weather station data and deriving physiographic descriptors from a digital terrain model.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of random forests (RFs) and generalized boosting regression models (GBMs), which are both ensemble learning methods that can handle randomness to some extent. For example, the context mentions that the RFs were fitted using the RANDOMFOREST R package with 500 trees, which can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's predictions.

Additionally, the context mentions that the GBMs were fitted using the GBM R package with a maximum of 10,000 trees, which can also help to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's predictions.

Overall, while the context does not specifically mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of ensemble learning methods that can help to mitigate the impact of randomness on model predictions.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention the use of deep learning methods, but rather traditional machine learning methods. The only mention of deep learning is in the reference "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" but it is not clear how this is related to the rest of the context.
