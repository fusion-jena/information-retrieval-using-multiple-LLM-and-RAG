The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study approached the problem of detecting and counting NBSB through images and videos acquired with drones. This suggests that the raw data may have been collected using drones equipped with cameras. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was tested with a public image dataset of NBSB in soybean fields and a novel dataset with more images, implying that the data may have been collected from various sources, including public datasets.
