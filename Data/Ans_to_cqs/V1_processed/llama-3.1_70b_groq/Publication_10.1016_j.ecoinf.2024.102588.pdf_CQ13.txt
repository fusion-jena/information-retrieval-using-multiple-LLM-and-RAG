The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models are as follows:

* Learning rate: The learning rate was initially set to 0.001, but it was automatically adjusted to determine the optimum point, resulting in the best performance of the CNN model.
* Optimizer: The Adam optimizer was used.
* Number of hidden layers and nodes: The ANN model used 6 hidden layers with 128, 128, 256, 256, 512, and 512 nodes.
* Loss function: The mean squared error was used as the loss function.
* Early stopping: The early stopping option was used to stop the model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy could not be improved.

Note that the hyperparameters for the CNN model with the autoencoder are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, except for the learning rate and optimizer.
