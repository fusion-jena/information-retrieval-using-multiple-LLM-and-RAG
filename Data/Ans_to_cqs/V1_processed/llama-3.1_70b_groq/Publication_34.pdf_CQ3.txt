Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN model, its training parameters, and the potential of deep learning methods for exploring biodiversity data. It does mention that the dataset used is the INPN - Données ﬂore des CBN agrégées par la FCBN, which is a collection of finely geolocated plant species observations in France, but it does not provide information on how the data was annotated. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
