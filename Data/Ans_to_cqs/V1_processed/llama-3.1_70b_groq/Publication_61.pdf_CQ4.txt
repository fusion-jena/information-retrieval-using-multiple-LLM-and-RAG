The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include:

1. Resizing: The patches are resized to 32 Ã— 32.
2. Normalization: The patches are normalized.
3. Vertical and horizontal flip: The patches are flipped vertically or horizontally with a probability of 0.5. Both flips are independent events.

There is no mention of other data augmentation techniques such as rotating or scaling in the provided context.
