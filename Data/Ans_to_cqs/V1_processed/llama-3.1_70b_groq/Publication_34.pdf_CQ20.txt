The hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include CPUs and a GPU. According to the provided context, the experiments were conducted on a Windows 10 machine with 2 CPUs, each having 2.60 GHz and 4 cores, and one NVIDIA Quadro M1000M GPU. The mxnet library, which is used for building and training the models, can automatically distribute calculations under CPUs or GPUs.
