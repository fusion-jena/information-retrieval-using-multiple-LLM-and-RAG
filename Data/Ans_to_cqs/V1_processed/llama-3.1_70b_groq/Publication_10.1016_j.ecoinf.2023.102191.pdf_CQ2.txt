I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline. The text primarily discusses a mobile app called Dive Reporter, which is used to collect data on marine taxa from recreational SCUBA divers. The app collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers, as well as information on the frequency and abundance of specific marine taxa. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline.
