The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a method that controls variables, which involves keeping other variables constant and selecting the parameters that optimize the validation data forecast results as the modelâ€™s hyperparameters. This is mentioned in the text as: "The structure of all models, including hyper-parameters such as kernel size and number of nodes, is determined using a method that controls variables." However, the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
