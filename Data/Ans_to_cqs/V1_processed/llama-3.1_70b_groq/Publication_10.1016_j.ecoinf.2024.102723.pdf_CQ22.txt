The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), and Normalized Mean Prediction Interval Width (NMPIW). These metrics are used to assess the quality of the model's predictions, with SMAPE and NMPIW being particularly useful for evaluating the accuracy and uncertainty of the predictions.
