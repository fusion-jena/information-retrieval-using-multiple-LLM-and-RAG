The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of AICc values to evaluate the goodness-of-fit and complexity of Maxent models and select the best model, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
