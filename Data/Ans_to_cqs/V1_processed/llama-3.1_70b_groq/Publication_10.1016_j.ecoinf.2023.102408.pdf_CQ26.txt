The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a stratified sampling method being applied to all AGB observations for model evaluation. This technique randomly allocated 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset.

It can be inferred that stratified sampling is used in this context to ensure that the training and validation datasets are representative of the overall data distribution. However, it is not explicitly stated as a technique to address data bias.

The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether these techniques are used to address data bias in this specific context.

In summary, the only technique mentioned in the context that could be related to addressing data bias is stratified sampling, but it is not explicitly stated as a technique for addressing bias.
