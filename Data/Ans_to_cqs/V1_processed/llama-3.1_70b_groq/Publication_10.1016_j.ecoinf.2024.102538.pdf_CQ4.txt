Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that data augmentation is performed on the fbank features, and four examples of data augmentation are visualized in Figure 2 for the Acridotheres cristatellus sound. The context does not provide further details on the specific techniques used for data augmentation.

Therefore, I can only confirm that data augmentation is performed on the fbank features, but I do not know the specific techniques used.
