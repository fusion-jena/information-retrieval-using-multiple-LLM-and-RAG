The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a dataset (Weed25) for weed identification, which suggests that a diverse dataset might have been used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of data augmentation techniques such as color jitter, mosaic, and others, which can help improve the model's robustness and generalizability.

The context also mentions the use of cross-validation, but it is not explicitly stated whether it was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data or to tune hyperparameters. Furthermore, there is no mention of stratified splitting or other techniques to ensure that the model is evaluated on a representative sample of the data.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the importance of evaluating domain gaps or shifts between training and testing data, which suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of generalizability. However, the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not clearly stated.

In summary, while the context suggests that some measures might have been taken to improve the model's generalizability, such as data augmentation and possibly cross-validation, the specific details are not provided.
