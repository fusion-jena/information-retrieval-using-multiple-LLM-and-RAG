The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be a list of authors and their contributions to a research paper, as well as some details about the methodology used in the paper, including the use of the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric and True Skill Statistics (TSS) to assess the performance of model predictions. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
