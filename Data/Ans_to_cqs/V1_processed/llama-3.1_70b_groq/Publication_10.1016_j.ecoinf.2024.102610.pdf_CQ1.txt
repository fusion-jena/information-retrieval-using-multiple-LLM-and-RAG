The provided context mentions several methods utilized for collecting raw data, although it does not explicitly state that these methods are part of a deep learning pipeline. The methods mentioned include:

1. Crowdsourcing: The context mentions a study by Laaksonen et al. (2017) that used crowdsourcing-based nationwide tick collection to collect data on the distribution of Ixodes ricinus and I. persulcatus and associated pathogens in Finland.
2. Public datasets: The context mentions the use of several public datasets, including:
	* WorldPop (https://www.worldpop.org/)
	* TerraClimate (Abatzoglou et al., 2018)
	* Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data (Funk et al., 2015)
	* Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
3. Remote sensing: The context mentions the use of MODIS, which is a remote sensing instrument that collects data on the Earth's surface.
4. Surveys: Although not explicitly mentioned, the context mentions a study by Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) that reviews machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious disease, which may involve surveys as a data collection method.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of methods used for collecting raw data, and it is likely that other methods are also utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
