I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context appears to be a research paper or a study on mangrove forests, and it discusses the methodology, results, and conclusions of the study. It also includes a list of references, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
