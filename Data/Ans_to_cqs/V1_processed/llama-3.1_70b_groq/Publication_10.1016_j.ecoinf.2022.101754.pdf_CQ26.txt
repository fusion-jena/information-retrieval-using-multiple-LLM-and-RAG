The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study utilized a "training-and-test approach with stratification splitting" (Section 2.6). This suggests that stratified splitting was used to split the data into training and test sets, which can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the splits are representative of the overall data distribution.

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context. It is possible that these techniques were used, but it is not explicitly stated.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that the study used a "cylindrical plot design" and "Lidar data thinning" to preprocess the data (Section 2.7). However, these techniques appear to be related to data processing and feature extraction rather than addressing data bias specifically.
