Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of collecting clean data for bioacoustics applications, the limitations of traditional methods, and the potential of deep learning-based denoising methods.

However, it does mention the difficulty of collecting diverse data, particularly in bioacoustics applications, where collecting clean recordings is often infeasible or requires recording captive animals that may not be representative of the wider population. This suggests that diverse data collection may be a challenge in this domain.

The context also mentions the sparsity of vocalisations in bioacoustics applications, which can make it difficult to develop large-scale datasets. This could potentially lead to data bias, but no specific techniques for addressing this bias are discussed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
