Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the cross-validation strategy, model performance evaluation, and results, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
