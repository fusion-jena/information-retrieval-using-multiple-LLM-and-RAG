Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the training and evaluation of machine learning models, specifically kNN, SVM, and ANN models, for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. It provides information on the model architecture, training algorithms, and performance evaluation, but does not provide details on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
