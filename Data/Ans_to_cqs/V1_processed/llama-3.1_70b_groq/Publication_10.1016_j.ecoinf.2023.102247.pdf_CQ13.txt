I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text mentions the use of an ensemble modeling approach with four different models, including one regression-based model (Generalized Linear Model (GLM)) and three machine-learning models (Maximun entropy (MaxEnt), RF (Random Forest), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)). However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in these models.
