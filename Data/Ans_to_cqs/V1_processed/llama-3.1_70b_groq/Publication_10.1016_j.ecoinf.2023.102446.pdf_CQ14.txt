Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the data collection and processing, the use of a TIPNet-based process network approach, and the analysis of sub-daily scale processes, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
