The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the data preprocessing, the creation of the training database, and the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Gaussian radial basis function kernel for classification. However, it does mention that the SVM achieved a "clean separation" for the training database, with over 85% of background thumbnails having a regression score lesser than 0.5, and 85% of fish thumbnails having a regression score greater than 0.5. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify thumbnails as either background or fish, but the specific strategy used to monitor performance during training is not described.
