The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the paper mentions the use of a pre-trained VGGnet, which is a type of CNN, and the weights of this network are fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes, which are techniques commonly used in CNNs to improve their performance on image classification tasks.
