The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is Stratiﬁed cross-validation. This is mentioned in the text as: "Stratiﬁed cross-validation was used, and evaluated with Precision, Recall and F-measure." This suggests that the model performance is evaluated using multiple iterations of training and testing, with the data split into different subsets to ensure that the results are not due to accidental characteristics of a specific partitioning.
