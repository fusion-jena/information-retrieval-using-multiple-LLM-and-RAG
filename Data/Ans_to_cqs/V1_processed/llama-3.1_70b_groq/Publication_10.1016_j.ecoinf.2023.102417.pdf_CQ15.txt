The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer, as mentioned in the context: "Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2017)". This suggests that the model uses the Adam optimization algorithm to update the model's parameters during training. No other optimization techniques are mentioned in the provided context.
