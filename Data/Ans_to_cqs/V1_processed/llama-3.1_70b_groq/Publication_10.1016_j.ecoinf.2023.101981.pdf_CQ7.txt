Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for detecting ungulate vocalizations, the acoustic data analysis software used, and the signal parameters required for running acoustic analyses. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
