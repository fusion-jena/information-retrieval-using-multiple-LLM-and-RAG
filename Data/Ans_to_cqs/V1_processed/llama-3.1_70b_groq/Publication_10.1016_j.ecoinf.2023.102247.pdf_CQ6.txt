Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling using ensemble modeling approaches in R, and it discusses the use of various environmental variables, climate scenarios, and model evaluation metrics. However, it does not provide any information on deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
