Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the derivation of the Potapov30m dataset using GEDI, Landsat, and SRTM data, as well as its validation using ALS data. It also mentions the use of a regression tree algorithm and the selection of high-quality training and validation data. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
