According to the provided context, before training a deep learning model, two preprocessing steps are involved:

1. Resizing: All images are resized to the same resolution (227Ã—197 pixels) by considering the mean dimensions of the set.
2. Normalization: The resized images are then normalized to the [0,1] range.

These preprocessing steps are applied to the images before training the deep learning models, specifically the six open-source CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0) selected for the classification task.
