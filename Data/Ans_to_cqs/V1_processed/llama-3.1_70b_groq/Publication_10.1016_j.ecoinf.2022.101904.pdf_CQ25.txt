The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is classification, specifically wetland mapping and classification of remote sensing imagery. The model aims to classify different types of wetlands, such as bog, fen, marsh, swamp, shallow water, urban, deep water, and upland, using remote sensing data. The model is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning models, which require a large amount of training data, by adaptively synthesizing wetland training data using a 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer). The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Kappa index, Average accuracy, and Overall accuracy, as shown in Table 5.
