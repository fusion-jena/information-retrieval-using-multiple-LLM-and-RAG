Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and performance of the UODN (Underwater Object Detection Network) and its variants, as well as comparisons with other object detection algorithms.

However, it does mention that the batch size of all networks is set to 16 uniformly, and various hyperparameters such as learning rates, momentum, and weight decay are listed, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
