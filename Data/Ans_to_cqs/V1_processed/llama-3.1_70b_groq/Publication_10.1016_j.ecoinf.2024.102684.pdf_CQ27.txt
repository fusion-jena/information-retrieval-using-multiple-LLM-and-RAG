Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology used to train and evaluate the models, including data acquisition, processing, and cleaning, as well as the assessment of transfer learning and spatial autocorrelation. It also discusses the limitations of deep learning models in remote sensing and the challenges of model validation.

However, it does mention that all models were implemented using the Keras library in Python 3.8.3, which suggests that the deployment process may have involved using Keras' built-in functionality for saving and loading models. But without further information, it is impossible to provide a detailed answer to this question.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
