I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of references related to ecological risk assessment, landscape planning, and conservation biology. There is no mention of model optimization or hyperparameter tuning in the provided text. The references seem to focus on various topics such as ecological risk assessment, landscape zonation, and conservation planning, but do not provide information on model optimization techniques like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
