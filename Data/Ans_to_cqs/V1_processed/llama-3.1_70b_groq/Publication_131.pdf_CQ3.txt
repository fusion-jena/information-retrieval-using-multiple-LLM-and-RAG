The provided context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does describe a data augmentation process for audio samples, where 10 additional audios were generated for each of the 865 audio samples in the database. These transformations were later reflected in the mel-spectrogram images.

It can be inferred that the data annotation technique used in this pipeline is related to audio data, specifically mel-spectrogram images. However, the exact annotation technique used is not specified in the provided context.

It's worth noting that the context mentions the use of mel-spectrogram images, which are a type of visual representation of audio data. This suggests that the annotation technique might be related to image annotation, but the specific technique used is not mentioned.
