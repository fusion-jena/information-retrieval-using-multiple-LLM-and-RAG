I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to species distribution models (SDMs), environmental covariates, and correcting sampling bias. It mentions various models such as Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent), but does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
