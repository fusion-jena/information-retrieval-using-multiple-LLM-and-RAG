The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that each model underwent training for 10 epochs, suggesting that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being based on a specific performance metric or plateau. Additionally, the context mentions that the model training time is quantified as the time required for a neural network to converge to a predefined accuracy or loss threshold, but it does not provide further details on what this threshold is or how it is determined.
