Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context primarily discusses the application of machine learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, in environmental science and other areas. It also mentions the use of random forest (RF) models and Lasso models, but does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
