Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to remote sensing image classification, specifically discussing the use of a Random Forest (RF) classifier and the challenges of acquiring large-scale training data. It also mentions the importance of considering the spectral signature of "new vineyard" areas and the potential for future studies to improve the classification of these areas.

However, the context does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
