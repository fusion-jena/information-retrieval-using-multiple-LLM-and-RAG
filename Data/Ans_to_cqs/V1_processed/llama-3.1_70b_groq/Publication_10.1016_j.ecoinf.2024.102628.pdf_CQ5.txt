The text does not explicitly mention the use of specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the ResNet-34 architecture, which is a variant of the ResNet family, was used. This architecture was pre-trained on a broad dataset, but the specific dataset is not mentioned. It is mentioned that the pre-trained model was used for transfer learning, which is a common practice in deep learning.

Although not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the pipeline is a custom dataset, as the text mentions that the image dataset is organized into 18 folders, one for each of the 450 m transects. This suggests that the dataset is specific to the problem being addressed and is not a standard benchmark dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

It is also worth noting that the text mentions ImageNet as a broad dataset that is commonly used for pre-training models, but it does not explicitly state that ImageNet was used in this specific pipeline.
