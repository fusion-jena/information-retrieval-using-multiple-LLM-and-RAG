Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, the use of metadata, and the integration of contextual information into the deep learning classifier. It does not discuss any methods for handling randomness or ensuring reproducibility in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
