Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution models, environmental covariates, and sampling bias, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, I can suggest some possible measures that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models, including deep learning models:

* Using a diverse dataset that represents the population of interest
* Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data
* Stratified splitting, which involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set

But without more specific information, I cannot confirm whether these measures were taken in this specific case.

Therefore, my answer is:

I don't know.
