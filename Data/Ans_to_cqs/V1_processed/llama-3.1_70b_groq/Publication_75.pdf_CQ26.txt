The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that one of the aspects that can strongly influence the whole classification or retrieval task is the "imbalance of categories of both the datasets." This suggests that data bias is a concern, but the specific techniques used to address it are not mentioned.

The context does mention some preprocessing steps, such as "background cleaning" and "spacing of the seeds during the acquisition," but these are not directly related to addressing data bias. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
