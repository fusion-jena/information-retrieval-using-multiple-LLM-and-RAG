I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and tables with posterior mean values, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the deep learning model mentioned in the paper "Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming" by Do and Tran (2023).
