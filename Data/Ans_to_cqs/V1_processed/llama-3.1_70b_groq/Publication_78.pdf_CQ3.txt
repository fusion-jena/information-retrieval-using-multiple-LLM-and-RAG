Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the feature extraction process using handcrafted descriptors and D-CNN models, as well as the classification of coral images using SVM. 

However, it does mention that the image is "segmentized and divided into small patches" as part of the proposed framework steps (Figure 3). This suggests that some form of image segmentation or patch-based annotation might be used, but the specific annotation techniques (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) are not mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
