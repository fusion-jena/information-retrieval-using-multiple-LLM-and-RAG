Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model performance, LULC mapping, and the parameterization settings for each of the four ML algorithms (kNN, SVM, ANN, and possibly a fourth algorithm not explicitly mentioned). It also provides details on the ANN model architecture, training phase, and tuning parameters.

However, it does mention that the Control() function was used to evaluate the tuning parameters for model performance, and Table S3 shows the parameterization settings for each of the four ML algorithms. Additionally, the context mentions that the LULC classes of the test datasets were defined as target variables and the band reflectance values as predictors.

But, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
