The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the chosen hyperparameters, such as the batch size (20 images), the RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a learning rate decay of 0.0001, and the loss function (mean squared error). However, it does not provide information on the method used to optimize these hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search.
