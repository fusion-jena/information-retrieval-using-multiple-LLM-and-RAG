The provided context mentions several data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it mentions:

1. Image data: The context mentions the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest, which involves classifying 1.2 million high-resolution images into 1000 different classes. This suggests that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline.
2. Audio data: The context mentions audio signal analysis and speech recognition, which implies that audio data is also used in the deep learning pipeline.
3. OL (Online Learning) data streams: The context mentions a multi-layered neural network model that receives successive OL data streams, but it does not specify the format of these data streams.

There is no mention of video data or CSV (Comma Separated Values) data in the provided context. However, it is worth noting that CSV data is often used as a format for storing and exchanging data in machine learning pipelines, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

Overall, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context, are image and audio data.
