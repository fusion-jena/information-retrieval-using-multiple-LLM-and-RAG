Based on the provided context, it appears that various methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, particularly in the field of remote sensing and wildlife conservation. Some of the methods mentioned include:

1. Drone imagery: Studies such as Wood et al. (2021) and Tovar-SÃ¡nchez et al. (2021) utilize drone imagery to collect data on animal populations and habitats.
2. Satellite images: Witharana and Lynch (2016) use very high spatial resolution satellite images to detect penguin guano.
3. Citizen science: Stammerjohn and Barrington (2020) engage citizen scientists in remote sensing to learn about habitat affinity of the Weddell seal in Antarctica.
4. Surveys: Shuford and Spear (1988) conduct surveys of breeding penguins and other seabirds in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.
5. Sensors: Although not explicitly mentioned, sensors are likely used in conjunction with drones and other data collection methods to gather data on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

It is also worth noting that some studies, such as Xu et al. (2024), review and analyze existing data from various sources, including public datasets, to train and validate deep learning models.

However, it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
