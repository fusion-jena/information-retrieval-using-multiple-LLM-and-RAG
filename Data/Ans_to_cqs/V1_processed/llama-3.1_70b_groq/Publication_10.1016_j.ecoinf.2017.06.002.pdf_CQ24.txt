I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to environmental monitoring and data collection, specifically regarding tree sap flow and sensor measurements. It discusses data collection frequencies, metadata, and data analysis, but does not touch on deep learning or randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
