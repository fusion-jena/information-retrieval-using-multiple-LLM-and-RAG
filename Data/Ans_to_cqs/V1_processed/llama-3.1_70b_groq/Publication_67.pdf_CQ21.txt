The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention a "Validation phase" (Section 2.5) which involves assessing the performance of the model on new images. This suggests that some form of metrics calculation and possibly confusion matrix analysis may be involved in the validation phase. 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or any other specific postprocessing steps. Therefore, we can only confirm that some form of validation and performance assessment is involved, but the exact details of the postprocessing steps are not provided in the given context.
