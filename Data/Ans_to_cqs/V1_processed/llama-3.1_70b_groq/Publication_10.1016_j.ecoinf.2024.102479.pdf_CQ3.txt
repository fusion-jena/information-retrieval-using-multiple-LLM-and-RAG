Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms, biomass estimation, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

However, I can suggest that data annotation is a crucial step in the deep learning pipeline, and various techniques are used depending on the specific task and dataset. Common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and classification. But without more specific information, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this query.

If you have any further questions or context, I'll be happy to try and help.
