The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a complete dataset and that the performance was evaluated on out-of-sample test images. This suggests that some form of splitting was used to separate the training and testing data. Additionally, the text mentions that the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives was calculated, which implies that some form of evaluation was performed to assess the model's performance. However, the specific details of the measures taken to ensure generalizability are not provided.
