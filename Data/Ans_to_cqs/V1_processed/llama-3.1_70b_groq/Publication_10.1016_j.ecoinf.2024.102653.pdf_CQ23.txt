To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was split into training and validation sets, with 70% of the data designated for training and 30% for validation. This division was performed through random selection, which helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is trained and validated on diverse subsets of the data.

Additionally, the model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset, corresponding to different time steps (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of flight activity recordings). This approach allows the model to learn from different segments of the data and helps to improve its generalizability.

Furthermore, the model was trained with various combinations of datasets, including 1, 2, 3, or all four datasets combined. This approach helps to ensure that the model is robust and can generalize well to different datasets.

However, it is not mentioned whether stratified splitting was used to ensure that the training and validation sets have the same class distribution as the original dataset. Also, there is no mention of using techniques such as data augmentation or transfer learning to further improve the model's generalizability.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include random splitting of the dataset, training on varying disjoint subsets of the data, and training on different combinations of datasets.
