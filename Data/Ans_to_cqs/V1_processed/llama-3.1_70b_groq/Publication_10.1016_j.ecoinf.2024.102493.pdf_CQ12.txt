LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) 

The provided context mentions a research paper titled "LSTM time series NDVI prediction method incorporating climate elements: a case study of Yellow River Basin, China" by Guo et al. (2023b). This suggests that the pipeline uses a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for time series prediction.
