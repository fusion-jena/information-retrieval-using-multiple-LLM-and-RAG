Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the application of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction in species distribution modeling, and mentions other dimensionality reduction methods such as tSNE and PCA. It also references various studies and papers related to dimensionality reduction, species distribution modeling, and population genetics.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
