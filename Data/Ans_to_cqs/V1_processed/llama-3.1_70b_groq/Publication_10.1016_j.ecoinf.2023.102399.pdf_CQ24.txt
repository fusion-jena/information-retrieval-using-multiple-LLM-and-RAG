Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be a collection of references and citations related to fish biomass estimation, aquaculture, and the use of neural networks in these fields. It does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline management or strategies for handling randomness.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
