Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the model training parameters, such as batch size, learning rate, and epochs, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
