The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F-Score
5. Loss

These metrics are used to assess the model's performance on both the public dataset and the real-time dataset. The results show that the model achieves high accuracy rates, with approximately 98.69% on the public dataset and 99.89% on the real-time dataset. The precision and recall rates are also high, with the model consistently achieving precision rates above 98% and recall rates above 97%. The F-Score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is also high, indicating that the model is able to balance precision and recall effectively. The loss metric is used to evaluate the model's performance during training, with lower loss values indicating better performance.
