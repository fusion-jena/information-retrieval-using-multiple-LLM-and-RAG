Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the development and evaluation of deep learning models for various applications, including ecology and conservation.

However, it can be inferred that some of the studies mentioned in the context may have utilized public datasets, such as the Microsoft COCO dataset, which is mentioned in one of the references. Additionally, some studies may have used sensors or other data collection methods, but this is not explicitly stated.

For example, the study by Antoine-Santoni et al. (2018) mentions the use of a wireless tracking and sensor system for monitoring animal behavior, but it is not clear if this system was used for collecting raw data for a deep learning pipeline.

Overall, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
