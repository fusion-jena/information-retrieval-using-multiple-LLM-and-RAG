The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically high-resolution orthophotos with a 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey. These orthophotos are divided into smaller labeled tiles (256 Ã— 256 pixels) and fed into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for processing.
