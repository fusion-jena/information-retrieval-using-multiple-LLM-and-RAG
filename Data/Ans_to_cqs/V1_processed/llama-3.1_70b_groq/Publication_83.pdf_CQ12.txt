The deep learning models used in the pipeline are CNN-based models, specifically a VGG style network and a SubSpectralNet architecture. The VGG style network is used with different input features such as Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, and percussive-component based spectrogram. The SubSpectralNet architecture is used with the Mel-spectrogram as the input. There is no mention of RNN or Transformer models being used in the pipeline.
