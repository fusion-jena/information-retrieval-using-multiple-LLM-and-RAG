The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. In fact, the context does not mention a deep learning model at all. It discusses a Random Forest (RF) model and its parameters, as well as the use of Sentinel-2A images and MODIS products for estimating Leaf Area Index (LAI). The context also mentions the use of out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation for tuning the RF model's parameters, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model.
