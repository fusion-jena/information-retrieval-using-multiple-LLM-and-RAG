The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the samples were randomly divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on the validation dataset during training. Additionally, the context mentions the use of metrics such as user's accuracy, total accuracy, and Kappa coefficient, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models. However, the specific strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training is not clearly stated.
