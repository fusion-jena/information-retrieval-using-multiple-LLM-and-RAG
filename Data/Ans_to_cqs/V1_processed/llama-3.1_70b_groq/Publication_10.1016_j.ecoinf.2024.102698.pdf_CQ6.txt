Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), for generating synthetic data and modeling coral cover. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, that are typically performed before training a deep learning model.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a "generator component" in the GAN model, which "learns the latent features of the data to generate a data sample." This suggests that some form of data transformation or feature learning may be involved in the process, but the specific preprocessing steps are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
