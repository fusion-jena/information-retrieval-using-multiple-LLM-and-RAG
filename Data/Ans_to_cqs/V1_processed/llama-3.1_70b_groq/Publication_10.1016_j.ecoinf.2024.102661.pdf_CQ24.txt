Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in LSTM neural networks. It discusses the exploratory phase of random searches for feasible hyperparameter configurations, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it can be inferred that the TPEBO algorithm's exploratory phase of random searches may involve some form of randomness, but the context does not provide details on how this randomness is controlled or managed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
