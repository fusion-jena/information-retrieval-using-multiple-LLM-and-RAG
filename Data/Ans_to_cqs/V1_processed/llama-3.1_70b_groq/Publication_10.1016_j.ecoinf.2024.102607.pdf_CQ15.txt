Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks, for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping. It also mentions the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and the potential incorporation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in future studies. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
