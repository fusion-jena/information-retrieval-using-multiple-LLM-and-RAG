Precision is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. This is evident from Table 3, which reports the precision results of each experiment for the upper-, left-, and right-pose models. Specifically, the table lists the precision values for different measures (P1, P3, P5, P6) for each experiment (E1 and E2). However, it does not mention accuracy or recall as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
