Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the training phase involves "two optimization techniques", but it does not specify what these techniques are. It also mentions "transfer learning" and "data augmentation", but these are techniques used to improve the model's performance, not hyperparameter optimization techniques. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
