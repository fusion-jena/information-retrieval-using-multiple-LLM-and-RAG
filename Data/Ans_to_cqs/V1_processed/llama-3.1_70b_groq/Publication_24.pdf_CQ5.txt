The provided context does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions that a dataset was randomly selected from the remaining sites, but it does not provide the name of the dataset. It appears that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset, possibly related to ecoacoustic surveying, as it involves the classification of biotic and anthropogenic sounds in audio files.
