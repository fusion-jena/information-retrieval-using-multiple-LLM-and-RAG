Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the CASE database, its relational schema, and the integration of various data sources for ecological informatics. It discusses the data platform, data sources, and the process of validating and loading enriched data, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
