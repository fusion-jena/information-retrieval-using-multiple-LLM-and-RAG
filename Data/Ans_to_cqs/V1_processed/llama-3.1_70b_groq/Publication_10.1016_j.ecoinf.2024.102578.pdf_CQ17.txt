Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions the use of a one-cycle learning rate policy with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001, but it does not provide information on other regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
