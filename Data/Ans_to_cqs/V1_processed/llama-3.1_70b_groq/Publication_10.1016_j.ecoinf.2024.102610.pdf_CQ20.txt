Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict infectious disease, tick distribution, and other biological phenomena, but it does not provide information on the computational resources used for training the models.

Therefore, I do not know which hardware resources (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) are used for training the deep learning model.
