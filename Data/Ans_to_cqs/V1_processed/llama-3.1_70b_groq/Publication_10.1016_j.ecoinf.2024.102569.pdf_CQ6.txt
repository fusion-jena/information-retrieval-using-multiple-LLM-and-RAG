The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, which removes the impact of heterogeneous observations. This suggests that some form of data cleaning or outlier removal may be involved in the preprocessing steps.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty, which is a form of regularization that can help prevent overfitting. However, this is not a traditional preprocessing step, but rather a technique used during model training.

The context also mentions the use of a gradient ascent method to compute the L1 penalized estimates, but this is a optimization algorithm used during model training, not a preprocessing step.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
