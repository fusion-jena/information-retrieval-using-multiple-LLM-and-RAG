The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, is primarily for image recognition and processing tasks. It is designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, making it highly effective for tasks like object detection, image classification, and even natural language processing. In the context of the provided text, the CNN model is used to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices, such as TDI, BMI, and FAI, using ecological monitoring data. The model is also compared with other machine learning models, such as ANN and SVM, to determine its performance in estimating these indices.
