Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and evaluation of the model, including the use of Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, the computation of SHAP values, and the evaluation metrics used. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
