Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning methods, such as random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion techniques, and neural networks, for tasks like estimating Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) and tree species classification using various data sources, including UAV-LiDAR, hyperspectral, and high-resolution RGB data. However, it does not delve into the specifics of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
