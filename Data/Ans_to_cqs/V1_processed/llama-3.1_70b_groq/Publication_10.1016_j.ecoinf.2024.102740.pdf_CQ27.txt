Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on grasslands, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model.

However, it does mention the use of Random Forest (RF) technique for classification, and the software used for this purpose, such as QGIS and SAGA. It also mentions the tuning of hyperparameters for the RF model, but it does not provide information on the deployment of the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query on the deployment process of a trained deep learning model.
