Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors created their own dataset due to a lack of existing quality data, and that they used data augmentation in their model, as referenced in [18]. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve model performance. However, it is not explicitly stated as a method to address data bias.

The context also mentions that the authors tested their model under difficult circumstances and complex backgrounds, which suggests that they may have attempted to collect diverse data. However, this is not explicitly stated as a method to address data bias.

The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if these techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
