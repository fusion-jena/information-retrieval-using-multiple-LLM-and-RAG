Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the convolutional neural network (CNN) used for the automatic detection of Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus covey calls.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset collected from a specific location, Di-Lane Plantation WMA, Burke County, Georgia, during autumn 2016-2018. This may raise concerns about the model's ability to generalize to other locations, times, or environmental conditions.

The context does mention that the model can be "retrained, or used as-is, to detect the target species of interest," which suggests that the researchers may have considered the potential need for retraining the model on new data to adapt to different conditions. However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
