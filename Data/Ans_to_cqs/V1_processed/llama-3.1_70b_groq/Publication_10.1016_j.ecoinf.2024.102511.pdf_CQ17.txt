Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning in bioacoustic classification, particularly in marine mammal research. It mentions the use of deep neural networks and the importance of significant sample sizes for all classes, but it does not delve into the specifics of regularization methods.

However, it does mention that there are increasingly new tools to enhance data or combine disparate datasets, citing Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019) as a reference. This reference is a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning, which might touch on regularization methods, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
