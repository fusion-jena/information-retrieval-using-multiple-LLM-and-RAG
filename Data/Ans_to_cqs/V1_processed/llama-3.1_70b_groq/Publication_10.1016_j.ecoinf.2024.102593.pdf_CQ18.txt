The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that model performance is compared using statistical metrics, such as comparing model predictions with known classes from a held-out part of the training dataset or an unrelated labelled dataset. Additionally, it suggests using Embedding Visualization (EV) to assess and compare characteristics and suitability of trained models, but this is more related to model selection rather than monitoring performance during training. Therefore, the exact strategy used to monitor model performance during training is not specified in the provided context.
