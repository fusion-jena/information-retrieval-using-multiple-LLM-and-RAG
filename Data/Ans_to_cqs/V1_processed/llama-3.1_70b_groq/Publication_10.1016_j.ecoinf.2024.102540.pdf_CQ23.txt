To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets in a ratio of 80:10:10, respectively. This splitting ratio was chosen based on prior evidence of exceeding performances in detecting small insects and diseases using deep learning models.

Additionally, the dataset was split independently for two different input resolutions: 640 × 640 pixels and 1280 × 1280 pixels. This suggests that the model was trained and tested on different resolutions, which can help improve its generalizability to different image sizes.

Furthermore, five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family were trained, including YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x. Each version has a different number of layers and parameters, which can help to evaluate the model's performance on different complexity levels.

However, it is not mentioned whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, and stratified splitting is a technique used to split the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes. Without this information, it is unclear whether these techniques were used to further ensure the model's generalizability.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, using different input resolutions, and training different versions of the YOLOv5 model family. However, it is unclear whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used.
