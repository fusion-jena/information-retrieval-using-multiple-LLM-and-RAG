The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training dataset consists of 80 Ã— 80-pixel image patches containing Ziziphus lotus shrubs and Bare soil with sparse vegetation, which were labeled by botanic experts. This suggests that the data annotation technique used is likely image classification, where each image patch is labeled as either Ziziphus or Bare soil.

There is no mention of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used for object detection tasks. The context only mentions that the images were labeled as a whole, without any specific annotation of objects within the images.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data annotation technique used appears to be image classification, where each image patch is labeled with a class label.
