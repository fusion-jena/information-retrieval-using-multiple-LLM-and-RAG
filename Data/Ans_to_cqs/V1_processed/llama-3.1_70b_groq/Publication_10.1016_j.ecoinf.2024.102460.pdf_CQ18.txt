Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the LSTM model, FMOP model, and other topics related to land use and time series data, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
