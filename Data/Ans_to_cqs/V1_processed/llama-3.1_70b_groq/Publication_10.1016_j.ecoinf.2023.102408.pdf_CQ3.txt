I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms for modeling complex phenomena and developing nonlinear regression models. It discusses the architecture of the ANN, the calibration parameters used, and the evaluation of the RF algorithm. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
