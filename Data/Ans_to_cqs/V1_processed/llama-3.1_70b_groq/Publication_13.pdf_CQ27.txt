Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and evaluation of the model, including the datasets used, the training procedure, and the performance metrics. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
