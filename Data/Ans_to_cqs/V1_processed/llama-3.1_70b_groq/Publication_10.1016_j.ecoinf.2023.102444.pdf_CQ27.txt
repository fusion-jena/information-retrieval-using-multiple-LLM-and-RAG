I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction and species distribution modeling, as well as the application of machine learning techniques in ecology. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of a deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
