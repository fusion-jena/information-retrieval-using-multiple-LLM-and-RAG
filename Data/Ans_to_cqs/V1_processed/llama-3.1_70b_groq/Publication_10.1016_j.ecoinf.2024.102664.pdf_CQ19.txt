I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). It only describes the architecture of the CNN and LSTM models, including the number of layers, nodes, and kernel sizes, but does not provide information about the frameworks or tools used to implement these models.
