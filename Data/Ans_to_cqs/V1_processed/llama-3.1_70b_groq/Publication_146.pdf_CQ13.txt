The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- Learning rate: 0.001
- Optimizer: Adam
- Momentum: 0.9
- Weight decay: 0.0005
- Batch size: 4 (due to limitations in computer memory)
- Number of epochs: 350

These hyperparameters were chosen based on studies that successfully implemented Yolo in remote sensing cases. The author of the Yolo-based "Yolt" model suggests implementing the same hyperparameters as the Yolo model, which are the default parameters of YoloV3. The choice of the Adam optimizer was also influenced by studies that proved its usefulness on relatively small datasets (less than 1000 images).
