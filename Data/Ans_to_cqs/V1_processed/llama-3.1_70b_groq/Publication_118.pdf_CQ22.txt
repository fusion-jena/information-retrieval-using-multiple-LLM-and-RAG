The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are:

1. Bcubed precision
2. Bcubed recall
3. Bcubed F-score
4. Purity

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different feature representations, including Spectral Indices, MFCC, and Auto Encoder, over 20 runs using a subset of the total dataset. The average, standard deviation, and variance of these metrics are reported in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
