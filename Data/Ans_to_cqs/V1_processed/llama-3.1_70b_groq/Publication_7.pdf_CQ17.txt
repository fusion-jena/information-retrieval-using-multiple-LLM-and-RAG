Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the application of pre-trained CNN image representations extracted from VGGnet to a coral reef classification problem. It discusses the effectiveness of the trained classifier on unlabelled coral mosaics and the analysis of coral reef trends, but it does not delve into the specifics of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this query.
