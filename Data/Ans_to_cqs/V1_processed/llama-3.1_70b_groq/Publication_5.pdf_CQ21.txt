The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the calculation of statistical accuracy metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Bias, and Correlation, which are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model and the random forest model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a grid search to determine the best values of hyperparameters for the random forest model, but it does not provide information on the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is the calculation of statistical accuracy metrics. The use of saliency maps and confusion matrices is not mentioned, and it is unclear whether they were used in the study.
