Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that the system is designed to classify 984 bird species, but it does not provide information about the datasets used for training and testing. It only mentions that the system uses spectrogram data and that the training data is diversified using a data augmentation method. Therefore, I do not know the specific datasets used in the pipeline.
