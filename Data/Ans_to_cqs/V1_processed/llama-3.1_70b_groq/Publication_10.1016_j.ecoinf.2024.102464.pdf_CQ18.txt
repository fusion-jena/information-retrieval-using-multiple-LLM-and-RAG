The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves, as shown in Fig. 3. The ROC curves plot the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) to quantify the proportion of correctly and incorrectly classified samples, respectively. The curves represent the mean area under the curve (AUC) of training and test data, which allows for the evaluation of the model's performance during training.
