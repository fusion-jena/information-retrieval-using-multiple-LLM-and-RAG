I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models in terms of interpretability, computational requirements, and performance on small datasets. It also mentions various studies and papers related to vegetation index extraction and remote sensing, but does not address the specific question about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
