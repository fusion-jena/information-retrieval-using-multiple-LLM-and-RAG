I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to stormwater management, nutrient pollution, and environmental justice, with a focus on a decision support tool for equitable nutrient reduction. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
