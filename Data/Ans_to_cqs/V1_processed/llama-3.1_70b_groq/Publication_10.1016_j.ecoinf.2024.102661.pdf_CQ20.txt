Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the methodology and approach used for hyperparameter optimization and the structure of the TPEBO-LSTM neural network. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.

However, I can suggest that the training of deep learning models, especially those with complex architectures like LSTM, typically require significant computational resources. In general, deep learning models are often trained on specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that are designed to handle the high computational demands of these models. But without further information, I cannot confirm whether GPUs or TPUs were specifically used in this case.
