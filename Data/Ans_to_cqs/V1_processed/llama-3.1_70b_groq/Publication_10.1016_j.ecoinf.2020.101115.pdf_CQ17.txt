I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to marine science, ecology, and data management, with topics such as fish stock separation, otolith shape and size, and FAIR data principles. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
