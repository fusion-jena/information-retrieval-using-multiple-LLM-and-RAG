Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the model was trained for 30 epochs, which was determined based on validation runs (Figure 2). It also mentions that a stochastic gradient algorithm was used for optimization, but it does not specify the type of optimizer or the learning rate. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
