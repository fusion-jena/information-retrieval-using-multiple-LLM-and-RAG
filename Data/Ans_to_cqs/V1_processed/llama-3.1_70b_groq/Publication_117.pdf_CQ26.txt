The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the algorithm employed crowd-sourced data to create the training sets, which could potentially introduce bias. 

The context also mentions that the training dataset was generated by selecting 500 survey images at random, which could be a form of random sampling. However, it does not provide information on whether techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling were used to address data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the algorithm used a version of the YOLO DCNN with pretrained weights from the COCO dataset, but it does not provide information on whether the COCO dataset was used to address data bias or if any other techniques were used to ensure diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
