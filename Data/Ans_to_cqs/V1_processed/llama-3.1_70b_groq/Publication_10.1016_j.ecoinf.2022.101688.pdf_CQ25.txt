The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is classification. The model is used to classify audio recordings of animal vocalisations, such as those of gibbons and whydahs, into presence or absence classes. The goal is to create a classifier that can automatically identify the presence of specific animal species based on their vocalisations, which can be useful for bioacoustics research and Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM).
