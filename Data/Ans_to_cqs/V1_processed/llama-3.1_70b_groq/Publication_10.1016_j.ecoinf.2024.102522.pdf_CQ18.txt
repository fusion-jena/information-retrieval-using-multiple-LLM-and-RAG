Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to focus on the results of the model, including its accuracy and validation data, but does not provide information on the specific methods used to monitor its performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
