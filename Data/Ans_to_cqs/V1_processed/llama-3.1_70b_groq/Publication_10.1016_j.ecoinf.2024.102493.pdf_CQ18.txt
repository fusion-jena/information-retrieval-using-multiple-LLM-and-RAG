I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. It appears to be discussing the use of the Optimal Parameter-based Geographical Detector (OPGD) to analyze the explanatory power of different drivers on the spatial variability of the kNDVI (kernel-based normalized difference vegetation index). The context explains the methodology used to select the optimal sampling grid, discretization parameters, and to identify the explanatory power of each driver factor. However, it does not mention anything about model training or performance monitoring.
