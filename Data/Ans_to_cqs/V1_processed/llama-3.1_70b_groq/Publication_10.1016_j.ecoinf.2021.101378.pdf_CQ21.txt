Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically random forest and Maxent models, to predict the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease based on environmental factors. It discusses the use of these models in ecological informatics and their effectiveness in managing complex and nonlinear ecological data.

However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps that are typically performed after model training, such as evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, or visualizing the model's decisions using saliency maps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training in this context.
