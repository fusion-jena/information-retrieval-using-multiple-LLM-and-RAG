I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of academic references and citations related to machine learning, river health, and ecological informatics. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository as requested.
