The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. According to the provided context, specifically the paper "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al. (2021), the model is used for modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring. The paper mentions the use of deep learning for classification, but does not provide further details on the specific type of classification task. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for classifying animal species based on their acoustic signals, such as birdsong.
