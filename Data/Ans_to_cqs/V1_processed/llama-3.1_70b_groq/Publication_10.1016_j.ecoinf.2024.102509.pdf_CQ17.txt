Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in regression analyses, specifically using the backpropagation (BP) training algorithm and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function.

However, it does mention that the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance, and repeated training and testing are necessary to develop an optimal neural network and attain highly accurate predictions. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of preventing overfitting, but the specific regularization methods used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
