The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite imagery, specifically Google Earth imagery and high spatial resolution satellite data, as the source of data for training and testing deep learning models. 

It can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected through remote sensing technologies, such as satellite or aerial imagery, rather than through surveys or sensors. The context also mentions the use of specific satellite spectral bands, such as red, green, blue, and near-infrared (NIR) channels, which suggests that the data is collected through satellite-based remote sensing.

There is no mention of public datasets or surveys being used as a source of raw data. However, it is possible that the researchers may have used publicly available datasets or surveys to validate or supplement their findings, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
