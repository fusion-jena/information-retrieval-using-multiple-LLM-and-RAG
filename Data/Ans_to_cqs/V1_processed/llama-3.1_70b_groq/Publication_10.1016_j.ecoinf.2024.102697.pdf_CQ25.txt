Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. In fact, the context does not mention deep learning models at all. It talks about machine learning methods, specifically random forest models, and their application in remote sensing. The context mentions that the study assesses model performance in various contexts, but it does not specify the purpose of the model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
