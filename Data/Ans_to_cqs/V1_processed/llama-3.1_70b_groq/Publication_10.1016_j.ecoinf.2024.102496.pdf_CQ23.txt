Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to an environmental study, discussing topics such as nutrient reduction, environmental justice, and best management practices (BMPs). It includes figures and tables, but does not mention deep learning or any related concepts.

Therefore, I don't know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
