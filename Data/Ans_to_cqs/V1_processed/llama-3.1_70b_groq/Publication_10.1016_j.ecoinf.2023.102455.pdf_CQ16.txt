Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on evaluating the performance of different machine learning models using various statistical criteria, including R, RMSE, and MAPE. It does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
