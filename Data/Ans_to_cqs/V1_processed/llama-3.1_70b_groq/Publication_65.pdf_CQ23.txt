To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. These include using a large dataset for training, The dataset was also cross-validated to ensure that the model was not overfitting to the training data. Stratified splitting was used to split the dataset into training and test sets. This helped to prevent overfitting and ensured that the model was evaluated on unseen data.
