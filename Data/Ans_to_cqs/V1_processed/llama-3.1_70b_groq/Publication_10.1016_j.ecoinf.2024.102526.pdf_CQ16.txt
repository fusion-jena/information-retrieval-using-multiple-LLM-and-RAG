I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to image capture and metadata for a study, possibly in a marine environment. It includes information on planned type of quantification, derived metrics, statistical comparisons, spatial and temporal extent, and image-level capture data. However, it does not mention training or validation loss plateau, which are terms typically used in machine learning or deep learning contexts. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
