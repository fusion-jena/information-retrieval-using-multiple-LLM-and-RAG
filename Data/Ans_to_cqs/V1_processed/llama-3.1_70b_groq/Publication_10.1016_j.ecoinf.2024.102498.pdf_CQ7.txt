The criteria used to split the data for machine learning model training in this study are as follows:

* 70% of the total samples (33,209) were allocated for training.
* 30% of the total samples were employed for testing.
* 10% of the training data was used for validation, which was used for hyperparameter tuning.

This is mentioned in the text as: "Of these, 70% were allocated for training, and the remaining 30% were employed for testing. Hyperparameter tuning for ML models was performed using validation data (10% of training data)."
