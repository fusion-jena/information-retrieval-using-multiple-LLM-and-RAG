The text does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training data collection pipeline could accelerate the collection of data for rare species, and that the pipeline increases the potential for region-optimized acoustic monitoring systems. This suggests that the data collection method may involve some form of regional or local data collection, but the exact methods are not specified.

Additionally, the text mentions that large-scale species recognition efforts often use crowd-sourced public training data from various geographic sources, such as the Xeno-Canto dataset. This suggests that public datasets may be one source of raw data used in the pipeline, but it is not clear if this is the primary method of data collection.

Overall, the text does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
