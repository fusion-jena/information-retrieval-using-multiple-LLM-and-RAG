Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions the use of the ResNet50 model, transfer learning, and fine-tuning techniques, as well as the architecture of the model, including the use of two fully connected layers and a dropout layer to reduce overfitting. However, it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used for training the model.
