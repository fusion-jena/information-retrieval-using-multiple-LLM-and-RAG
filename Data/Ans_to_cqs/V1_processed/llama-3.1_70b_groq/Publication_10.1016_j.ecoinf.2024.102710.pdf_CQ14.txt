I don't know. The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the active learning experiments, sampling strategies, and the use of a pre-trained model (BirdNet-1) as a feature embedding model, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
