The text does not mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather discusses the use of random forest, logistic regression, and generalized additive models (GAMs). However, it does describe measures taken to ensure the generalizability of these models.

To ensure generalizability, the authors used cross-validation (CV) techniques. Specifically, they employed two types of CV: random CV and spatial CV. Random CV involves randomly splitting the data into training and testing sets, while spatial CV takes into account the spatial structure of the data when splitting it into training and testing sets. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not biased towards a specific region or subset of the data.

The authors also tested both raw and scaled versions of the features, which helps to ensure that the model is not sensitive to the scale of the input data. Additionally, they used different feature sets, including 'random-CV' and 'spatial-CV' features, to evaluate the robustness of the model to different feature selections.

Overall, the authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their models, including the use of cross-validation, testing different feature sets, and evaluating the model's performance on both raw and scaled data. However, it is not clear if they used a diverse dataset or stratified splitting, as these are not mentioned in the text.
