Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a strategy of using 80% of the samples for training and 20% for testing is used to enhance the generalization of the machine learning model and prevent overfitting. This suggests that the authors are using a form of regularization, but the specific methods used (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization) are not mentioned.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that a "regularized deep convolutional neural network with data augmentation" is used in a referenced paper (Mushtaq, Z.; Su, S.-F. Environmental sound classification using a regularized deep convolutional neural network with data augmentation. Appl. Acoust. 2020, 167, 107389.), but this is not the same as the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context.
