Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases, as well as feature elimination techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). It does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this query.
