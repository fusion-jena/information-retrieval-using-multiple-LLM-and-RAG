The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is trained to identify images of red kites (Milvus milvus) from a dataset of images, with the goal of reliably identifying predefined classes such as the presence of red kites in image data. The model is evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify images as either containing a red kite or not, with metrics such as training accuracy, validation accuracy, and validation loss. The context does not mention segmentation or detection as the purpose of the model, but rather classification of images into two categories: red kite or not.
