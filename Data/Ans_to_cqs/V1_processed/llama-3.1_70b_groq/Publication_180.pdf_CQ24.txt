Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for automated species identification of Triatominae, the vectors of Chagas disease, using TensorFlow. It discusses the adaptation and configuration of TensorFlow for the project, including adjustments to the validation percentage and number of training steps. However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query.
