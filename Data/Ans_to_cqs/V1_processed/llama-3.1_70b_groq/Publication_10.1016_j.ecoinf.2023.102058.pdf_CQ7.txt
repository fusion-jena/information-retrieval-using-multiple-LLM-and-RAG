Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the application of machine learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, and it mentions various techniques such as Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and Random Forest (RF). However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

That being said, in general, common practices for splitting data for deep learning model training include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets using random sampling.
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in each set.
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k folds, using k-1 folds for training, and 1 fold for testing, and repeating the process k times.

However, without specific information from the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
