Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and their applications in remote sensing, ecology, and other fields. It discusses the use of SVM for classification tasks, feature selection, and parameter optimization, but it does not delve into deep learning or optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

However, it's worth noting that the context does mention the use of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and the optimization of SVM parameters, such as Gamma (Î³) and cost, but these are specific to SVM and not directly related to deep learning optimization techniques.

Therefore, I couldn't find any information on optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam, in the provided context.
