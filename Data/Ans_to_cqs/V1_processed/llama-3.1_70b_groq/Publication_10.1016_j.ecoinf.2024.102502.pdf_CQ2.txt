Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on data filtering and preprocessing for remote sensing data, specifically using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and discussing the use of spectral indices and image data. However, it does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

The context mentions the use of image data, specifically EOS data from the GEE online repository, but it does not explicitly state the format of this data (e.g., GeoTIFF, JPEG, etc.). Additionally, there is no mention of audio or video data formats, and CSV is not mentioned in the context of the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
