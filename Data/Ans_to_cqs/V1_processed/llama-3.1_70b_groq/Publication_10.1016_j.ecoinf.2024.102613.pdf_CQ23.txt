I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to be a collection of questions related to data management, analytics, and smart farming, but it does not provide information about the development or evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
