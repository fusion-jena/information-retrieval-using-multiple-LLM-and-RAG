Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be a collection of references and data related to deep learning applications in wildlife monitoring and animal behavior analysis.

However, I can provide some general information on common strategies used to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. These strategies include:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques such as data augmentation to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which can help reduce the impact of randomness.
3. Employing regularization techniques, such as dropout, to prevent overfitting and reduce the effect of random fluctuations in the training data.
4. Using ensemble methods, which combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data, to reduce the impact of randomness.

It is worth noting that the specific strategies used to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline can depend on the particular application and the characteristics of the data. Without more information on the specific context and requirements of the pipeline, it is difficult to provide more detailed guidance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are several general strategies that can be employed to address this issue.
