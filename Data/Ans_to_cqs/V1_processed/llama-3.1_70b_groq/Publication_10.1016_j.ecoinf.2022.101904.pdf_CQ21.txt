Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, data preparation, and training time, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
