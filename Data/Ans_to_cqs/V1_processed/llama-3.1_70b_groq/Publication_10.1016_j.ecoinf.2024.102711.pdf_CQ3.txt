I don't know. The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a focus on AutoGluon, a specific AutoML library. It discusses the challenges of working with small datasets, the importance of hyperparameter tuning, and the use of k-fold cross-validation. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
