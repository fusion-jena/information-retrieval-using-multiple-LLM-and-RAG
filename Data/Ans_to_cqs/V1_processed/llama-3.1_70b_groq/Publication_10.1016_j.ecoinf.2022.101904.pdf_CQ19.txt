Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions various deep learning models such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, CNN, and GAN, but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these models.

Therefore, I don't know which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. The context only provides information about the performance of different models on a specific task, but it does not provide details about the implementation or the frameworks used.
