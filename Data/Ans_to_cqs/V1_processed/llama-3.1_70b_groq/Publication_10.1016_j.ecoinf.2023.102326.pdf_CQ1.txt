The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the work involves analyzing "large-scale acoustic data" and "audio recordings from 23 different sites in Bochum, Germany". This suggests that the raw data may be collected through audio recordings or sensors, but the exact methods are not specified. Additionally, the context mentions the use of "machine learning approaches" and "sound event classification", which implies that the data may be collected through automated means, but the details are not provided. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
