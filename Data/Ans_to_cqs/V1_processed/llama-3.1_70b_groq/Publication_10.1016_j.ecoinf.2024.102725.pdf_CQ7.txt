Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to focus on the application of deep-learning enhanced fusion methods for NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study, as well as the use of the Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS) method for reconstructing NDVI time series. However, it does not provide information on the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
