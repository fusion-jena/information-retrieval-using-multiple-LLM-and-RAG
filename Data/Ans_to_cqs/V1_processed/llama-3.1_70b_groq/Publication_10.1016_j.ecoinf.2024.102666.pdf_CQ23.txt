Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and snippets related to remote sensing and land cover classification, but it does not provide specific information on the deep learning model's generalizability measures.

However, I can suggest that the context mentions the use of "fused multi-sensor satellite data" (Kumar, A., Gorai, A.K., 2023) and "multi-conditional algorithm" (Lafon, V., Doxaran, D., Gernez, P., Vanhellemont, Q., 2018), which might indicate the use of diverse datasets. Additionally, the context mentions "comparative evaluation" (Kumar, A., Gorai, A.K., 2023) and "validation" (indicator of terrestrial influence in Baltic Sea coastal areas algorithm development and validation), which might suggest the use of cross-validation or other validation techniques.

However, without more specific information, I cannot confirm the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
