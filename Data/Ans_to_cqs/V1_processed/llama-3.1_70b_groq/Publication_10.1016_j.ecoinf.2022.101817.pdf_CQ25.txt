The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is designed for environmental condition classification, where the model is trained to classify images into six different environmental condition classes. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the VGG architecture, and it is trained on a dataset of images extracted from videos. The model's performance is evaluated on a validation dataset, and the results are presented in a confusion matrix.
