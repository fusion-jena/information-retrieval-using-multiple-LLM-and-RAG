The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models are RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R2. These metrics are mentioned in the context as the evaluation measurements used to assess the performance of the models, including ANFIS, ANN, and SVM.
