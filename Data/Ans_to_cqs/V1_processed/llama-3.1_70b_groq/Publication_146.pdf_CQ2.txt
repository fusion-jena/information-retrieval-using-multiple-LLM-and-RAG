The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data. The context mentions Sentinel-1 images, which are converted into the darknet annotation format with text files containing information on the label class of objects and positions in the image. The images are also cropped into image tiles in the sizes of 640 Ã— 640 pixels. Additionally, the context mentions that the images are in single-polarization greyscale format, specifically HH and VH. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
