Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of various modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression for refining fire risk maps, but it does not provide specific details on the regularization methods used.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests, in other studies. But it does not provide information on the regularization methods used in these studies.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
