The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning techniques or optimization methods such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on hyperparameter optimization for a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query about optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline.
