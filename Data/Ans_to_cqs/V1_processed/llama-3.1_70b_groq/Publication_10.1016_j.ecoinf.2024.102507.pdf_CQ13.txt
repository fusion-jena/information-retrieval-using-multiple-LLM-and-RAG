Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions the architecture of the models (VGG19, ResNet50, and a combination of both) and some of the layers used in the model (e.g., Dropout, Dense), but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for training the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
