Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the AutoML procedure generates candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters selected at random from a prespecified range of values. It does not provide details on what those specific hyperparameters are.

However, it does mention that the number of layers is one of the hyperparameters that is varied in the candidate models. Additionally, the text mentions that the selected candidate model is trained on the full training data to identify an optimal number of training epochs, which suggests that the number of epochs is also a hyperparameter that is being tuned.

Overall, while we can infer that the model is using some hyperparameters such as number of layers and number of epochs, the specific values or ranges of these hyperparameters are not provided in the text.
