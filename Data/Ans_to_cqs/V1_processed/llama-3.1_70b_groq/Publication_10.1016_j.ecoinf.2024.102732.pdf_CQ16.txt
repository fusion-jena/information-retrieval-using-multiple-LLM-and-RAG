Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on various machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, SVR, and RF, and their applications in predicting forest biomass and vegetation fire detections. It also discusses model evaluation metrics, such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared, but does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

However, it is common in machine learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, where the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, to determine when training is complete. Other criteria may include a maximum number of epochs or iterations, or a minimum change in the model's performance metrics.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
