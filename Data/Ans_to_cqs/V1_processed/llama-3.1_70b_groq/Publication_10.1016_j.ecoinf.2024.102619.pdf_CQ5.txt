The text does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention "Datasets 1, 2, and 3" in the context of training the CNN model, but it does not provide further information about the composition or source of these datasets. It also mentions ImageNet in the context of a reference (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), but it is not clear if ImageNet is one of the datasets used in the pipeline.
