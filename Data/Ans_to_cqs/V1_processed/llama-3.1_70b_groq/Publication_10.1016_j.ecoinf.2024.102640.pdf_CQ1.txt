The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a dataset called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) which is proposed for training the GVI-learning model. It also mentions the use of airborne lidar data in a study by Chen et al. (2015) for assessing visual green effects of individual urban trees.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of existing datasets such as COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and ADE20K, which are likely used for training and testing the deep learning models. These datasets may have been collected using various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, but the specific methods used are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the methods used for collecting raw data may include airborne lidar data and existing datasets, but the exact methods used are not specified.
