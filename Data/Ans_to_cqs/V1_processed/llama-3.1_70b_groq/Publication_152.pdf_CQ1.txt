The method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, is through the use of a DJI Phantom 2 drone. This drone is used to gather images of the Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species, for classification purposes. The drone is equipped with a camera that captures images of the vegetation from a constant height above the ground. These images are then used as input for training the U-Net, a deep learning model used for image classification and segmentation.
