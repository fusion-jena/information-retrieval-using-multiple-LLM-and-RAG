The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a GoogLeNet architecture. This is mentioned in the provided context as the winner of the 2015 ImageNet competition, which is an identification challenge on 1000 different classes. The GoogLeNet architecture is composed of 22 layers and uses inception modules, allowing the network to use convolutions of different sizes and weight each of these convolutions.
