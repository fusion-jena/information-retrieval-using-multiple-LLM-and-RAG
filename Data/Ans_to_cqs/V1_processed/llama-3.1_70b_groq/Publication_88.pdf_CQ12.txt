The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a variant of CNNs called Stacked Networks (SN). The EF network architecture consists of three convolutional layers, two Max-pooling layers, and two Fully Connected layers, which is a typical architecture for a CNN. The CSVM approach also uses a CNN-like architecture with three convolutional layers, each followed by a Max-pooling layer. The SN architecture is composed of multiple subnetworks, each of which is also a CNN-like architecture with three convolutional and two Max-pooling layers. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
