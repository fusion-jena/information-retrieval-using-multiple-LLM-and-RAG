Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the feature extraction and classification methods used for bird species recognition, such as deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and handcrafted features.

However, it is mentioned that Xie and Zhu used audio recordings from the Xeno-Canto website, which suggests that public datasets or online repositories might be one source of raw data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of audio recordings, which implies that sensors or recording devices might be used to collect raw audio data.

Other than these indirect hints, the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this query.
