Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the use of structural re-parameterization techniques, the design of the AlexNet network, and the comparison of the proposed model with existing models. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
