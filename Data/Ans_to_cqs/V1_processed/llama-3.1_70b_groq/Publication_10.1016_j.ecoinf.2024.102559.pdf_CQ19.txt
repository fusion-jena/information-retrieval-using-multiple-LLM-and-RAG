Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. However, it does mention scikit-learn, which is a machine learning library for Python, but it is not typically used for building deep learning models. The context also mentions Python, which is a programming language often used for deep learning, but it does not provide information on specific deep learning frameworks.

It's worth noting that the context does mention a paper titled "Learning from imbalanced data" by He and Garcia, which discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, to handle imbalanced data. However, this paper does not provide information on specific deep learning frameworks used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which deep learning frameworks are used to build the model.
