The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the minimal validation loss. According to the text, "The best model was selected based on minimal validation loss that occurred at epoch 448." This suggests that the training process is stopped when the validation loss reaches its lowest point, which is at epoch 448 in this case. There is no mention of a validation loss plateau being used as a criteria for determining when training is complete.
