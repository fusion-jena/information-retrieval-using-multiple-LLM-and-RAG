Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on various topics, including a comparison of deep learning frameworks, animal behavior, and event-stream processing architectures. None of the provided references or text snippets mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.

However, it's worth noting that the context does mention a paper by LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton (2015) titled "Deep learning," which is a well-known paper in the field of deep learning. While this paper may discuss various datasets used in deep learning, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine which specific datasets are mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
