The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the authors evaluated the impact of different training data ratios on the final accuracy of wetland mapping. Specifically, they used different ratios of training data from reference data, starting from 10% to 90%, increasing by 10% each time.

It can be inferred that the authors used a random split of the data, but the exact criteria or method used for splitting the data is not specified. The context only mentions the varying proportions of training data used, but not the specific criteria or method used to split the data into training, test, and validation sets.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not specified in the provided context.
