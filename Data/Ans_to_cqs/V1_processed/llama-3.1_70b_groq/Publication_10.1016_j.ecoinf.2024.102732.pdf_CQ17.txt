The provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that Support Vector Regression (SVR) uses a regularization parameter (C) to balance model complexity and empirical risk, making it suitable for a wide range of regression applications. Additionally, it mentions Lasso Regularized Logistic Regression as a comparison method in one of the cited studies. But it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used in a deep learning pipeline.
