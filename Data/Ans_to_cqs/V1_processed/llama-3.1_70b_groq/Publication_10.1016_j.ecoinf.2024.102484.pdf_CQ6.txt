Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to research papers on land degradation, soil properties, and ecosystem service change, but it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used in deep learning models.

However, one of the papers mentioned, "Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning" by Huang et al. (2019), might imply that some preprocessing steps were taken before training the deep learning model. But the context does not provide details on what those steps were.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
