Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the model is an Attention-based Ordinary Differential Equation Gated Recurrent Unit (AODEGRU) model, and it provides some details about the model's architecture and training process. However, it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used.

The context does mention that the model is trained using a loss function and an optimizer, but it does not specify which optimizer is used or what the learning rate is. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
