Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions that deep learning has achieved great success in both theoretical and practical applications, but it does not provide information on the frameworks used to implement deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
