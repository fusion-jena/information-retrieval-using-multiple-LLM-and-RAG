After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved include generating prediction records and calculating various metrics. 

To generate prediction records, predictions were made for every 8-second interval for the entire unvalidated recording period. These predictions were then averaged together to create a single prediction record. The 8-second interval predictions were then aggregated into hourly prediction records, which contained the number of instances that each particular sound stimulus was predicted per hour. These hourly records were normalized by the number of 8-second intervals actually recorded during that hour to account for missing audio data.

As for metrics calculation, the average unweighted and category-weighted training classification accuracies were calculated, as well as the average unweighted and weighted accuracies for the test data. The F1-scores for the training and testing datasets were also calculated.

A confusion matrix was also generated for the test data, which is shown in Table 4. However, the training confusion matrix is not provided due to brevity.

There is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context.
