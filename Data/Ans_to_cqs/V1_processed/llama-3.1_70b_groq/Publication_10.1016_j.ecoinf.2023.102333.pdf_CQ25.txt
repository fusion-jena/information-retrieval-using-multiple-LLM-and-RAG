The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically Land-use and land-cover classification (LCLU). The article discusses the use of deep neural networks (DNN) for LCLU classification and explores the optimization of hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. The authors aim to enhance the accuracy of LCLU classification by comparing different approaches for optimizing the hyperparameters of the DNN model.
