Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Field surveys: Field data were collected during the vegetation season in July 2019 on 109 sample plots. The field survey data, including tree positions and positions of the center of the plots, were collected using Field-Map technology.
2. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data: Several studies mentioned the use of airborne LiDAR data for estimating forest aboveground biomass and stem volume, such as Kankaer et al. (2013) and Anderson et al. (2013).
3. Landsat imagery: Some studies used Landsat imagery for above-ground biomass estimation, such as Zhang et al. (2019) and Comparison of machine-learning methods for above-ground biomass estimation based on Landsat imagery.
4. Small-footprint LiDAR data: Kim et al. (2009) used small-footprint LiDAR data to distinguish between live and dead standing tree biomass.

It is also mentioned that some studies used statistical forest inventory plots and Field-Map technology to collect data. However, it is not clear if public datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
