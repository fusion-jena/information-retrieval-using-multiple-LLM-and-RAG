I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text appears to be a research article discussing the use of supervised learning approaches for seagrass detection in the Mediterranean, and it describes various machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training these models.
