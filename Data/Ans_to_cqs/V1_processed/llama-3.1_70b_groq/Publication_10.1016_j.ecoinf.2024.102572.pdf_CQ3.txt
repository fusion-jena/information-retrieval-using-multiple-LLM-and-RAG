Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of satellite images, machine learning techniques, and geospatial computations for land use and land cover (LULC) data analysis, forest fire detection, and carbon emissions quantification. It does not provide information on the data annotation techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
