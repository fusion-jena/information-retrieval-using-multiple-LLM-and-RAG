Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the ResNet-50 model, its variants, and its application in feature extraction for image classification. It also mentions the training times and validation accuracies of different ResNet models, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
