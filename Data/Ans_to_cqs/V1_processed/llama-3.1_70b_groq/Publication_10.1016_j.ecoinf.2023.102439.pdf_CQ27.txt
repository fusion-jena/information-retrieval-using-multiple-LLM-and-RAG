Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modeling and prediction tasks, such as recruitment forecasting of yellowfin tuna, modification of urban built-up area extraction, and mapping and monitoring of land use and land cover changes. However, it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained models.

The context does mention the development of a hybrid model by combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm, and the use of this model to define vegetation biomass density for 2030. It also discusses the performance of the model and its predictive capabilities. However, it does not provide details on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
