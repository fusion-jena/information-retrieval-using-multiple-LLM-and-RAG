The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors had to build their own dataset due to a lack of previous information. This suggests that they may have collected their own data, possibly through methods such as aerial imaging or photography.

The context also mentions that the dataset was built for cactus recognition in aerial images, and that the area of study was the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley in Mexico. This implies that the data collection may have involved capturing images of cacti in this region, possibly through aerial surveys or photography.

Additionally, the context mentions the importance of including more examples in the dataset, obtained under different conditions, such as different daylight conditions or different year seasons. This suggests that the authors may have used methods such as time-lapse photography or seasonal surveys to collect data.

However, without more information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
