The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Average Precision (AP), precision, and recall. Specifically, the paper mentions that the FRC_ResNet152FPN model obtains the best detection precision and recall trade-offs, and its AP is approximately 5% higher than that of FRC_ResNet18FPN and 8% higher than that of FRC_ResNet34FPN for small objects. This suggests that AP is a key metric used to evaluate the model's performance, particularly for object detection tasks. Additionally, the paper mentions that the model's performance is evaluated in terms of precision and recall, indicating that these metrics are also used to assess the model's effectiveness.
