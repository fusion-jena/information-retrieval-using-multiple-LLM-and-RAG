I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the development and evaluation of a pipeline for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a convolutional neural network, but it does not provide information on where the code is hosted.
