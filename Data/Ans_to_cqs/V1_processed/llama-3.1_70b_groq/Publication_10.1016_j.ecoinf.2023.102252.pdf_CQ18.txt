I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a section of a research paper discussing a model called FERM, its parameters, and example values for a specific application. However, there is no mention of a strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The context seems to focus on the model's parameters, data requirements, and potential applications, but does not provide information on the training process or performance monitoring.
