The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as mentioned in the provided context, is to use 80% of the samples as training samples and 20% as test samples. This strategy is widely used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning model and prevent overfitting. Additionally, a balanced sampling was carried out for the test set, where one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was selected for each type of anuran call. 

There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context. However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and test. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training is complete.
