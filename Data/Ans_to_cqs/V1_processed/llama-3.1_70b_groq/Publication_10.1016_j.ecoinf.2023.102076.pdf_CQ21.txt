Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data collection, preparation, and classification tasks, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps taken after model training.

However, it does mention that the development sets were used to evaluate classification performance during experiments, and the testing sets were used to evaluate the final classifier for each classification task. This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation was performed, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
