The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, IUC-NN, include accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). 

For the binary threat level model, the metrics reported are test accuracy (84.3%), positive predictive value (88%), and negative predictive value (79%). 

For the detailed level model, only test accuracy is reported, which is 64%. 

Additionally, cross-entropy loss is used as a metric to evaluate the model's performance during training and validation. The model with the lowest cross-entropy loss is selected as the best model.
