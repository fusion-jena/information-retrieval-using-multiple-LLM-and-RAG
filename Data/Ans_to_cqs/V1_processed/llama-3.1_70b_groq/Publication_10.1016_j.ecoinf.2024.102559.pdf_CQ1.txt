The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remotely sensed images and hyperspectral data for land use and land cover classification, as well as the application of Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification.

It can be inferred that the methods used for collecting raw data may include:

* Remotely sensed images from satellites or aerial platforms
* Hyperspectral data from specialized sensors
* Public datasets, such as those provided by Google Earth Engine or NAIP (National Agricultural Imagery Program)
* Possibly, other sources of data such as field surveys or sensors, although these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of cloud computing and machine learning to analyze remotely sensed data, which suggests that the data collection process may involve large-scale data collection and processing. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated.
