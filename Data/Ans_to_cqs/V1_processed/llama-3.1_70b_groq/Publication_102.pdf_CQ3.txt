The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the datasets used (e.g., the aerial elephant dataset) likely involve object detection and counting tasks.

The context mentions the use of a density map to estimate the number of objects in an image, which suggests that the annotation technique might involve annotating the location and density of objects in the images. However, the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not explicitly mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a U-Net architecture, which is commonly used for image segmentation tasks. This might suggest that instance segmentation or semantic segmentation annotation techniques could be used, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, while we can make some educated guesses about the possible annotation techniques used, the exact techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
