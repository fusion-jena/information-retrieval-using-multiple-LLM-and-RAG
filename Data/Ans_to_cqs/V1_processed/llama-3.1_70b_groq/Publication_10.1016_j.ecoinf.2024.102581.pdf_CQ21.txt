Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily discusses the training process, hyperparameter tuning, and the interpretation of accuracy and loss graphs. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.

However, it does mention that the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss, and that the model's classification performance improves as the number of epochs increases. But it does not elaborate on the specific postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
