The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or CIFAR-100. However, it is mentioned that the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) was pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories, which is likely referring to the ImageNet dataset.
