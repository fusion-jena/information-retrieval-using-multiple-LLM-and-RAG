The purpose of the model is not explicitly stated as a traditional deep learning task such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the context, it appears that the model is being used for regression tasks, specifically to identify potential drivers of changes in growth across two herring populations. The model is trained on time series data of explanatory variables, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE). The goal of the model is to predict the response variable based on the explanatory variables, and to identify the most important variables contributing to the changes in growth. The model is also used to compare the performance of different models (RI and RY) and to evaluate the effect of different hyperparameters on the model's performance.
