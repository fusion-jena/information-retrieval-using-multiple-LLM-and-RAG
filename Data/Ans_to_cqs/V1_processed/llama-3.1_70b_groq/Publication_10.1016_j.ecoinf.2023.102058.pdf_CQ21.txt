Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids. It discusses the use of different machine learning approaches, such as principal component regression, partial least square regression, and random forest, but does not delve into the postprocessing steps after model training. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved in this context.
