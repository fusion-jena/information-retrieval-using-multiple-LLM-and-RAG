The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention several datasets related to Earth observation and remote sensing, including:

* Sentinel-2 Level 2A
* S2cloudless Cloud Probability
* Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD)
* Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)
* Landsat 8 Observation Land Images (OLI)
* PlanetScope Biannual Surface Reflectance Mosaics

These datasets appear to be related to the study of wetlands, ecosystem health, and land use classes in East Africa, but they are not the typical datasets used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks.
