Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention that the deep learning method used a version of the YOLO DCNN with pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. This suggests that the model may have been initialized with the same weights for each run, which could help reduce randomness. 

Additionally, the context mentions that a training dataset was generated by selecting 500 survey images at random, which implies that there may be some randomness in the selection of the training data. However, it does not provide information on how this randomness was handled or if any strategies were employed to ensure reproducibility.

Overall, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
