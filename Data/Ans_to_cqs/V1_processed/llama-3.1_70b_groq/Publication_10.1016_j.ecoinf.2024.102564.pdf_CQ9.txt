I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article discussing the use of machine learning methods, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF), to model net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The context provides information on the methods used, the parameters configured, and the results obtained, but it does not mention the data repository.
