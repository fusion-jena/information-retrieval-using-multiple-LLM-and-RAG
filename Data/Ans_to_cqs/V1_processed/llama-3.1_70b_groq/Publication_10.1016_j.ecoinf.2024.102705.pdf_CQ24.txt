Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the definition and applications of deep learning, as well as its utilization in various domains like computer vision and speech recognition.

However, it does mention the use of optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad), Root Mean Square Prop (RMSProp), and Adam, which are employed to assess each parameter's contribution to the loss value during the training process. These algorithms may involve random elements, but the context does not provide specific information on how randomness is handled.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
