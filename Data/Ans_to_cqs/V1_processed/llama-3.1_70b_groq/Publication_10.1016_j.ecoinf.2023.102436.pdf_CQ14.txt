I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the methodology used to calculate the restorative potential of a landscape, including the normalization of metrics, the calculation of the final score, and the use of a statistical gap-filling technique to estimate the restorative potential for the remaining regions. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters.
