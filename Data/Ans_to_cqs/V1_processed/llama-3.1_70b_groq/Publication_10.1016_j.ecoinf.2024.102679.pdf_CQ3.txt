Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that the Semi-Automated Deep Learning (SADL) model is used, which combines deep learning with human manual interpretation steps to minimize human effort while maximizing the quality of counting results. However, it does not provide details on the annotation techniques employed.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
