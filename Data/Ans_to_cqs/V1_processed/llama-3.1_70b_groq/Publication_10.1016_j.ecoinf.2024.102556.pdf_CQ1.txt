Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the development and enhancement of deep learning algorithms, specifically in the field of computer vision, rather than data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that some of the studies mentioned in the context may have used data from various sources, such as:

* Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for collecting data on migrating Tibetan antelopes (Hu et al., 2020)
* Public datasets, as mentioned in the reference to the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (He et al., 2017)
* Possibly, camera traps or other sensors for collecting data on red pandas (He et al., 2019)

But without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
