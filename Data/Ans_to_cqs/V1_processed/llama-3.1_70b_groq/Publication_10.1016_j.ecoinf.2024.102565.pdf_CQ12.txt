The text does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a Neural Network (NN) model, which is a type of deep learning model. The text provides some details about the structure of the NN model, including the number of neurons in the input and output layers, and the use of hidden layers. However, it does not provide enough information to determine the specific type of NN model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, etc.).
