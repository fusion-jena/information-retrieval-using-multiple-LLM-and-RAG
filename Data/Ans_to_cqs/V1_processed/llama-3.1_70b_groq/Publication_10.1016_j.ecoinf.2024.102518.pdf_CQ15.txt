I don't know. The provided context does not mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and ecological niche modeling, and it discusses the use of MaxEnt, a maximum entropy modeling algorithm, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the pipeline.
