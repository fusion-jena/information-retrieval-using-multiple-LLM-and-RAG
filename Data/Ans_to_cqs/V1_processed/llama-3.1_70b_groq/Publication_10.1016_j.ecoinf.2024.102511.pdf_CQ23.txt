Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention some general considerations and challenges related to bioacoustic classification tasks.

The context highlights the importance of including a diverse dataset, mentioning that "ideally, all species would be included in a classification model, so as to better represent the local species diversity" and that "all events would ideally be included in the classification model, so as to better represent the variability found in the area". However, it also notes that this can be challenging, especially when dealing with small sample sizes and variable call characteristics.

The context also mentions the use of confidence levels in determining species identity, recommending that training data include a high level of confidence for inclusion, especially for species with small sample sizes.

While cross-validation and stratified splitting are not explicitly mentioned, the context does discuss the importance of properly applying and testing neural network classification methods on a novel dataset. It also notes that modification of existing machine learning methods with a lower barrier to entry may be sufficient for many bioacoustic classification tasks.

Overall, while the context provides some general insights into the challenges and considerations related to bioacoustic classification tasks, it does not provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
