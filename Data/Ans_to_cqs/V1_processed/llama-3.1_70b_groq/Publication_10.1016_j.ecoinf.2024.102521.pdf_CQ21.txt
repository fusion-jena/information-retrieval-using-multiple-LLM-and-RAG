Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the STARdbi interface, model training, and inference, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
