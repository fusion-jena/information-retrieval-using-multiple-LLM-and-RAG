Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data pre-processing methods such as data cleansing, mean imputation, and capping, but does not discuss techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

However, it does mention that the study employed various methods to pre-process the data, making it suitable for analysis, and that data cleansing involved identifying and removing incomplete or inaccurate records to ensure the dataset's accuracy. But it does not provide specific information on addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
