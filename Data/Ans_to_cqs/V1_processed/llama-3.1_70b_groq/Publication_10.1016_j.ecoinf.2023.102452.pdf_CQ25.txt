The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context is primarily for forecasting and prediction tasks. Specifically, the papers mention the use of deep learning approaches such as LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting, as well as the use of neural networks for solving civil engineering problems.

In the paper by Dehghani et al. (2023), the authors compare the performance of different deep learning models for short-term streamflow forecasting, indicating that the purpose of the models is to predict future streamflow values based on historical data.

Similarly, in the paper by Uncuoglu et al. (2022), the authors compare the performance of different machine learning models, including neural networks, for solving civil engineering problems, suggesting that the purpose of the models is to make predictions or forecasts in the context of civil engineering.

There is no mention of classification, segmentation, or detection tasks in the provided context. Therefore, it appears that the primary purpose of the deep learning models in this context is for forecasting and prediction tasks.
