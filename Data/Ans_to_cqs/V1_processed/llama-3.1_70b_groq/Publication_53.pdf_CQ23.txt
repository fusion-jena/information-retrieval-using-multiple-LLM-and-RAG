To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, data augmentation was used with the fastai get_transforms function. This included allowing for vertical flipping of images ("flip_vert = TRUE"), limiting overly exposing the images ("max_lighting = 0.02"), disabling the zooming augmentation ("max_zoom = 1"), and reducing the memory load on the graphical processing unit (GPU) ("to_fp16 = TRUE"). 

Secondly, an 80-20% split was applied for training and validation datasets, respectively. This split helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting.

Lastly, transfer learning was utilized by initializing an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model. This approach allows the model to leverage the knowledge gained from a large and diverse dataset (ImageNet) and adapt it to the specific task of detecting farm dams.

There is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context.
