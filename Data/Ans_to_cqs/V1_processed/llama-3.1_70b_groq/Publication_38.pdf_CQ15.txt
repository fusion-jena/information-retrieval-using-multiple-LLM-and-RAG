Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNNFAST network, its application in bat acoustic signal detection, and references to related research papers on deep learning and audio classification. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the optimization techniques used in this specific pipeline.
