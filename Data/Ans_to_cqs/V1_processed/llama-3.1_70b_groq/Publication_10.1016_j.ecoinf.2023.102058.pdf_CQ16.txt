Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses various machine learning models, including PCR, PLSR, and RF, and their applications in remote sensing and water body analysis. It also mentions the use of a grid search to find the best number of trees (ntrees) in a Random Forest model, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this context.
