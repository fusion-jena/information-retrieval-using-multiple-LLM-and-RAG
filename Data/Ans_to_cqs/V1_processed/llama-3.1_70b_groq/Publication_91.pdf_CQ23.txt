To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. 

Firstly, the dataset was split into three sets for training, validation, and testing in the proportions 80:10:10. This stratified splitting approach helps to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on diverse subsets of the data, which can improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the images in the training set were augmented in various ways, including flipping horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. This data augmentation approach helps to increase the diversity of the training data, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Additionally, the large size of the dataset, with 426,876 images covering 35 species, also contributes to the model's generalizability. The dataset is significantly larger than those used in comparable studies, which suggests that it may be more representative of the diversity of pollen species.

However, it is not mentioned whether cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation is a technique that involves training and evaluating the model on multiple subsets of the data, which can provide a more robust estimate of its performance and generalizability.
