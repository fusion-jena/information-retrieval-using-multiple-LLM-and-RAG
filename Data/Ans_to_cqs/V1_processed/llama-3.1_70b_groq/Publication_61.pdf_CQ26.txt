The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to improve the accuracy of the deep learning model. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. In this context, the techniques used for data augmentation are:

* Resizing the patches to 32 Ã— 32 and normalizing them
* Vertical and horizontal flip of the patches with a probability of 0.5

These techniques can help to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce the impact of data bias. However, it does not provide information on other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that data augmentation is used to improve the accuracy of the deep learning model, but the specific techniques used are limited to resizing, normalizing, and flipping the patches. Other techniques mentioned in the query are not mentioned in the provided context.
