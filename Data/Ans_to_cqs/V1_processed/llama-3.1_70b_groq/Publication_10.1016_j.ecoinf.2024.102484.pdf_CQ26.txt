Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological studies, and the mentioned papers focus on topics such as land degradation, deforestation, and ecosystem service change. The only mention of deep learning is in the paper by Huang et al. (2019), which uses high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning to monitor ecosystem service change, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
