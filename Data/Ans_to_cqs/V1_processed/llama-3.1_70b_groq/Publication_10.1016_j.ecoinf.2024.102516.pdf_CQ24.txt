Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for plant species identification, semantic segmentation, and image analysis. It discusses the advantages and limitations of using dedicated plant cover data for training CNNs but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to this query.
