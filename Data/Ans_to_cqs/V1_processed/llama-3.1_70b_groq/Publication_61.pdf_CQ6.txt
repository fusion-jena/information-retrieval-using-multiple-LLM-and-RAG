Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include resizing and normalization. Specifically, the patches are resized to 32 Ã— 32 and then normalized. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as vertical and horizontal flipping with a probability of 0.5 are applied to the patches. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if any cleaning or scaling steps are involved in the preprocessing.
