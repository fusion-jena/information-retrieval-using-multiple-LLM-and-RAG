The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the preprocessing steps in the input layer of UODN "enhance the ability of the model to represent the data, thereby improving the model performance during training." This suggests that the model performance is being monitored or evaluated during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used to do so are not provided in the given context.
