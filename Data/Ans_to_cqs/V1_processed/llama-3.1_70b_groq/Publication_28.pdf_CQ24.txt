The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the "reparameterization trick" used in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to handle stochasticity.

The reparameterization trick involves transferring the sampling process to the input layer, allowing the network to learn from the stochastic input. This is achieved by sampling from a standard normal distribution (N(0, I)) and then transforming the sample using the mean and covariance of the latent variable (z|x). This trick enables the network to learn from the stochastic input while maintaining differentiability.

While this is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does provide insight into how VAEs handle stochasticity. However, the context does not provide information on strategies for setting random seed values or handling randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
