The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy (OA). 

The precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for each class (Grassland, Savanna, and Forest) and are presented in a confusion matrix. The precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. The recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The overall accuracy (OA) is also reported, which is 92.8% in this case. This suggests that the model is able to correctly classify 92.8% of the pixels in the test dataset.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, allowing for an assessment of its ability to accurately classify different physiognomies in the Brazilian Savanna.
