Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the results of various algorithms, including ICSNet, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-152, and provides information on their accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, min-batch size, time, and number of layers. However, it does not provide details on the hyperparameter optimization process.

The only relevant information is Figure 7, which shows the relation between Min-batch size and Accuracy, Epoches. This suggests that the authors may have experimented with different min-batch sizes to find the optimal value, but it does not provide information on whether grid search, random search, or other optimization methods were used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
