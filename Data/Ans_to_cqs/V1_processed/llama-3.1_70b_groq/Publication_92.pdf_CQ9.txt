Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture of the network, the use of inception layers, and the post-processing and bounding box fusion, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
