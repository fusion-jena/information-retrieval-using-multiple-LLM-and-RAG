The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that "leave-one-out cross-validation was also carried out." This implies that the data was split in a way that involves removing a single bird from the dataset for each species, training the model on the other birds, and then validating the model on the single bird. This is a form of cross-validation, but the exact criteria for splitting the data into training and validation sets is not specified.
