I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning models such as AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes) for modeling forest AGB, but it does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning in a study by Zhang et al. (2019), but it does not provide details on the specific model architecture used.
