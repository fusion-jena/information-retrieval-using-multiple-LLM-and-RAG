The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the BirdNET deep learning model are precision and recall. According to the text, the average recall was 29.7% ± 3.9 SE, and the average precision was 80.9% ± 3.8 SE. The recall and precision values are also reported for each of the 23 species in Table 1, which is not provided in the given text. Additionally, the text mentions that the relationships between the confidence thresholds and the precision and recall values are species-specific, and that species-specific confidence thresholds were used to yield detection scores that account for the precision-recall tradeoff.
