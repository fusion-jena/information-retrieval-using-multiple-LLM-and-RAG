Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values in deep learning. The context primarily focuses on random forests, a type of ensemble learning method, and its application in species distribution modeling.

However, it does mention the use of a random number generator in the context of random forests modeling, specifically stating that "all modeling used the same random number generator" (Kuhn, 2008; R Core Team, 2023). This suggests that using a fixed random seed value can help ensure reproducibility in modeling results.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of techniques such as bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and averaging results to reduce variance and prevent overfitting in random forests. While these techniques are not directly related to handling randomness in deep learning, they do demonstrate the importance of addressing randomness and variability in machine learning pipelines.

In summary, the provided context does not provide specific strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, but it does highlight the importance of addressing randomness and variability in machine learning modeling.
