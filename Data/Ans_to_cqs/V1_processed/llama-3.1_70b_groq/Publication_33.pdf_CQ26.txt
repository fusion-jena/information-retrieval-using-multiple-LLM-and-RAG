Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the post-processing phase, specifically on the proposed framework for calibrating Deep Learning models and controlling error rates in ecology.

However, it does mention the use of two independent databases, T0 and T1, for training the classification model and tuning the risk threshold, respectively. This could potentially help in reducing overfitting and improving the model's generalizability, but it does not directly address data bias.

Additionally, the context highlights the importance of using diverse data sets for training and testing the model, as it mentions the use of "big datasets where species are unidentified" and the need for "real-time biodiversity monitoring from remote sensors." However, it does not provide specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
