Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the training dataset could be pre-processed, such as denoising, contrast enhancement, and image resizing, but only image resizing was used to make the images suitable for the input image resolution required for the selected models.

However, it does mention that the class distribution in the Extinction dataset is provided in Table 2, which suggests that the dataset may have class imbalance issues. But it does not provide any information on how this issue is addressed.

Therefore, I do not know what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this specific study.
