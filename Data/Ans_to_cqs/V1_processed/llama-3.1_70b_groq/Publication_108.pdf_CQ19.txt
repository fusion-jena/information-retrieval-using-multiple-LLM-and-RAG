The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of TensorBoard, which is a visualization tool often used with TensorFlow, but it does not confirm that TensorFlow is the framework used. Therefore, I do not know which framework is used to build the deep learning model.
