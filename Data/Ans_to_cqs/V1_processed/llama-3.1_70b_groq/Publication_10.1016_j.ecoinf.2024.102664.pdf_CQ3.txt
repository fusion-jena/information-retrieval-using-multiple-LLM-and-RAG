I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the structure of the CNN and LSTM models, the adjustment process of the solver for training the network, and the input time series length for all deep learning models. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
