The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the parameters of the LTR algorithm are optimized, but it does not specify the method used for optimization, such as grid search or random search. It only mentions that the parameters are optimized and that the optimized parameters can improve the overall accuracy and kappa of the model.
