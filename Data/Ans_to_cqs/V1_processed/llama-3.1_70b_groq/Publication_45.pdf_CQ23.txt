The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the training of the individual candidate networks was stopped when the accuracy of the network on the test dataset did not increase further. This suggests that the model was evaluated on a separate test dataset, which is a common practice to assess the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the experiments and predictions were conducted using the TensorFlow framework, which provides tools for implementing techniques such as cross-validation and stratified splitting. However, it does not explicitly state that these techniques were used in this specific study.

Therefore, while the context suggests that some measures were taken to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, it does not provide enough information to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
