Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the application of Deep Learning (DL) methodologies in animal behavior studies, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks or tools used to implement these methodologies. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
