Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions, but it does not provide details on the model development or evaluation process. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer this question.
