The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps. However, it does mention the calculation of performance metrics, including confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve. 

Specifically, it defines the confusion matrix as one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. The context also mentions that conventional metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not provide a detailed list of postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of performance metrics, such as confusion matrices, but the context does not provide a comprehensive list of postprocessing steps.
