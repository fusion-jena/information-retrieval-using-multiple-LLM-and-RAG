Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to digitized natural history collections and provides information on the architecture of the CNNs used, as well as supplementary materials for training the networks. It does not discuss data preprocessing techniques or methods for addressing data bias. Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias in this context.
