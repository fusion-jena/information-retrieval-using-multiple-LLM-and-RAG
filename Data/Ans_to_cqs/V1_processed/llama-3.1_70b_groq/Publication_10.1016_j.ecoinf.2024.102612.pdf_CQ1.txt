The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of multispectral LiDAR (MS LiDAR) data, which suggests that the raw data is collected using LiDAR sensors. Additionally, the context mentions the use of synthetic data, which implies that the data is generated artificially rather than collected from real-world sources. It does not provide information on whether surveys or public datasets are used.
