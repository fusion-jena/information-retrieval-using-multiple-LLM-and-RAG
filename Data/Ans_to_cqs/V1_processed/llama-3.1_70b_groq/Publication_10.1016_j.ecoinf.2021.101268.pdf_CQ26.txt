The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data distribution is 70.12% for training, 1.69% validation, and 28.19% for testing, which suggests that the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

Additionally, the context mentions that the validation samples are selected randomly from the first group, which could imply that some form of random sampling or splitting is used. However, it does not provide enough information to determine if techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
