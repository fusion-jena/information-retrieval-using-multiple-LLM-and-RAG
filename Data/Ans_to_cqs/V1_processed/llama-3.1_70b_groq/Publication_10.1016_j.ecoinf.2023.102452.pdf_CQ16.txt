The text does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the Eureka Pro software is utilized for GP modeling, and that a standard data split is employed, where 70% of the available data is used for model training, and the remaining 30% is dedicated to testing and evaluating the results. This suggests that the training process may be terminated when a predetermined number of iterations is reached or when a satisfactory performance is achieved on the training data, but the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete is not specified.
