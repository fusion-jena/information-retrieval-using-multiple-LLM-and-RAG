I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. It mentions that details on the hyperparameters used for model fitting are provided in Supplementary material 1: Text S2, but this information is not included in the provided context. The context only mentions the use of GLM, GAM, and RF models, but not deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
