Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the prediction of dissolved oxygen concentration in water using various machine learning and deep learning methods, and it mentions various research papers and studies related to this topic. However, it does not mention any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
