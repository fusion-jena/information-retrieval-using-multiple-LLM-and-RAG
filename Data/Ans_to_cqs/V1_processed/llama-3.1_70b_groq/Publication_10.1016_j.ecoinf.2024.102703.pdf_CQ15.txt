I don't know. The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network in MATLAB R2014b, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used. Additionally, it mentions the use of the LASSO model for variable selection and statistical regularization, but this is not directly related to deep learning optimization techniques.
