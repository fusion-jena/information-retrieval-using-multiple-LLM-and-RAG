The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as mentioned in the study, include:

1. Optimizer
2. Activation function
3. Initial learning rate
4. Learning rate drop period
5. Learning rate drop factor
6. Number of neurons

These hyperparameters were tuned using the Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization Scheme (HHOS), which combines manual and random search methods sequentially. The study established a search space for each hyperparameter by selecting a set of values that had shown good results in previous studies. The HHOS then systematically explored various hyperparameter combinations within the specified range through random sampling, allowing a comprehensive parameter space search.
