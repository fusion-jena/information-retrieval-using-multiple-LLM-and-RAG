The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation of the ResNet50 model using random ten-crop testing with smaller data augmentation parameters than those used during training.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of accuracy results for the ResNet50 model and the PlantNet tool on three test datasets, including the Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist datasets. The accuracy results are reported in terms of Top1 and Top5 accuracy percentages.

It can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved in evaluating the model's performance, but the specific details of the postprocessing steps are not provided in the given context.
