The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that stratified sampling was employed to split the data into training and testing sets. Specifically, it states that "80% (240 data rows) used for training the model and 20% (60 data rows) for testing." This suggests that the data was split into training and testing sets using a simple random sampling approach, where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% was used for testing. There is no mention of a validation set.
