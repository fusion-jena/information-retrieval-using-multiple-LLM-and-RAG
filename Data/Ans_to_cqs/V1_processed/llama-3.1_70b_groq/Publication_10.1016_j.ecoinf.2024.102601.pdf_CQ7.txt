The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset is randomly split into 3000 for training and 2000 for validation, which is a 60/40 ratio. This suggests that the data is split into training and validation sets, but it does not provide information on the criteria used for splitting. Additionally, there is no mention of a test set.
