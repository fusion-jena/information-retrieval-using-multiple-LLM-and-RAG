The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the issue of class imbalance and the potential for overestimating model performance for rare classes and underestimating it for abundant classes.

One of the papers mentioned, "Increasing the accuracy of neural network classification using refined training data" by Kavzoglu (2009), discusses the importance of refining training data to improve the accuracy of neural network classification. While it does not specifically mention techniques for addressing data bias, it highlights the need for careful consideration of the training data.

Another paper, "AIDE: Accelerating image-based ecological surveys with interactive machine learning" by Kellenberger et al. (2020), mentions the use of interactive machine learning to improve the accuracy of image classification. However, it does not discuss techniques for addressing data bias.

The other papers provided do not mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
