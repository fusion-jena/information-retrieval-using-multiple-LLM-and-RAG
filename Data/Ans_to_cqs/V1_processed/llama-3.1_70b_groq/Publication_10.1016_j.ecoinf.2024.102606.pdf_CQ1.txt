Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology, specifically for species identification, and the use of computer vision for analyzing images and videos. It also discusses the importance of data augmentation techniques for increasing the size of the dataset and improving model performance.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the context is a manually annotated dataset, which suggests that the data collection process may involve manual efforts, such as collecting and labeling images or videos of species. Additionally, the context mentions the use of public datasets, such as the PlantCLEF challenges, which provide large and complex image datasets for evaluating state-of-the-art machine learning models.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, it suggests that manual efforts and public datasets may be involved in the data collection process.
