The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is used to classify motion frames in videos, specifically to identify hummingbird visitation events. The model is trained on images for each class and is used to classify candidate motion frames in test videos. The model is also fine-tuned to reduce false positives and improve its performance.
