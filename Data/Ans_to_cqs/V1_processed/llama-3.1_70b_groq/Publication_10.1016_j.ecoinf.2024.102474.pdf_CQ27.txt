Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the data used, model training efficiency, and the results of the model training process. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
