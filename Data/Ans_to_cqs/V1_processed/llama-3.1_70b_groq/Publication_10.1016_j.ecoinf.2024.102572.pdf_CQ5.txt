Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on land use and land cover (LULC) data, Sentinel-2 satellite photos, and forest fire data, but it does not mention any of the datasets typically used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
