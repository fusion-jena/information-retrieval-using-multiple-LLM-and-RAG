The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the analysis of the MaxEnt model's output, specifically the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables to the model. It discusses the use of permutation importance and jackknife methods to evaluate the importance of variables, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
