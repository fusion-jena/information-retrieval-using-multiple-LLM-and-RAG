Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and functionality of the Faster R-CNN model, its application in agricultural pest recognition, and the use of cloud computing. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness or random seed values in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a softmax function in the classification layer, which is a common technique used in deep learning to normalize the output probabilities. Additionally, the context mentions the use of fully connected layers (FCs) and the regressor branch, which may involve random initialization of weights and biases. Nevertheless, the context does not provide explicit information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
