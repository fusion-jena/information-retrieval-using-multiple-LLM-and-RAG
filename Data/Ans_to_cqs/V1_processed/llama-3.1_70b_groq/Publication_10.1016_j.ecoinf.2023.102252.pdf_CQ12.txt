I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or a pipeline. It appears to be a passage from a research article discussing environmental flow, riparian ecosystems, and biodiversity maintenance. The text mentions energy balance models and empirical approaches to ecological modeling, but it does not provide information about the use of deep learning models or specific architectures such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
