Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on pollination models, specifically the ApisFis model, and discusses the comparison of field estimations with model predictions, as well as the importance of pixel size in urban areas. However, it does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
