Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of different deep learning models for bird object detection, the dataset used, and the conclusions drawn from the study. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that were applied to the data before training the models. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study.
