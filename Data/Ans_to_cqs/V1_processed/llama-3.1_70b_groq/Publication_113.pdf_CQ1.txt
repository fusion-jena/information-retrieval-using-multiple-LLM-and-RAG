The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of camera trap images in the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, which suggests that sensors or camera traps can be one method for collecting raw data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a large dataset, which could be a public dataset, but it does not provide further information on how the data was collected.

It is also mentioned that the MegaDetector model was run over the NACTI dataset, which produced crops that were used in the active learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide information on how the NACTI dataset was collected.

Overall, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that sensors or camera traps and public datasets might be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, but the exact methods used are not specified.
