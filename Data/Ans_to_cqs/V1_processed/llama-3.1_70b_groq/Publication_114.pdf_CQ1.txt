The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data in the study. It also mentions that the tree sample can be measured well in field work, suggesting that field measurements may be used to collect data. Additionally, the context mentions the potential for using crowd sourcing to collect tree samples.

It is also mentioned that there are benchmark datasets publicly available for training and testing of deep learning approaches in remote sensing fields, but it does not specify which datasets are used in this particular study.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the methods that can be inferred to be utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are:

* High-resolution RGB images
* LiDAR data
* Field measurements
* Crowd sourcing (potentially)

However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data in this study are not fully specified in the provided context.
