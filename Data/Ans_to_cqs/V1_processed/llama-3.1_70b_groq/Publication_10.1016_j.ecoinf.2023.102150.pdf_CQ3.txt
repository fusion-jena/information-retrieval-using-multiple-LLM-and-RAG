The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of machine learning for image classification and annotation.

According to the context, AIDE (Annotation Interface for Data-driven Ecology) is an open-source web framework for image annotation that provides tools for training machine learning models. It is mentioned that AIDE allows for semi-automatic workflows that combine automatic classification and human labeling. This suggests that AIDE may use some form of annotation, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of camera traps to study small mammals, and the development of camera trap devices and software tools for camera trap data management and image annotation. However, it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
