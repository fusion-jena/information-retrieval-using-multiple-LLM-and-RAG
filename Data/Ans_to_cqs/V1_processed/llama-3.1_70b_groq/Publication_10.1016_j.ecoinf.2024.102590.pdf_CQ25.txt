The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned as a potential methodology for future Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) analysis. Specifically, it is mentioned that "deep learning CNN" could be used to map land cover or woody cover in future studies. This suggests that the deep learning model would be used for classification tasks, such as classifying aerial images into different land cover categories. However, the exact purpose and details of the deep learning model are not provided in the context.
