The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context, are specifically designed for audio waveform data. The four popular data augmentation techniques used are:

1. Changing audio speed
2. Pitch shift
3. Amplitude scaling (also known as gain modulation)
4. Adding Gaussian noise

These techniques are applied to the audio waveform to artificially enrich the dataset size and diversity, which can enhance the generalization capability of neural networks. There is no mention of flipping, rotating, or scaling in the context, as these techniques are typically applied to image data.
