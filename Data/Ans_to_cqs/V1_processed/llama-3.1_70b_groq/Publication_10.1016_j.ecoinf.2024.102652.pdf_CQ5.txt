Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of a modified U-NET (MU-NET) algorithm for soil salinity mapping and semantic segmentation, but it does not provide information about the datasets used for training or testing the model. It mentions the use of a 5-band multispectral image with additional salinity indices, but it does not specify the source or name of the dataset. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
