Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text only discusses the architecture of the CNN model, its components, and the training process, but does not provide information about the hardware used for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
