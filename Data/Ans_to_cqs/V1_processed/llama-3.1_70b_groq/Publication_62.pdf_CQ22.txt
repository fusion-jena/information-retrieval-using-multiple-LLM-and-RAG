Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the architecture of the CNNs, the training process, and the applications of deep convolutional neural networks, but it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
