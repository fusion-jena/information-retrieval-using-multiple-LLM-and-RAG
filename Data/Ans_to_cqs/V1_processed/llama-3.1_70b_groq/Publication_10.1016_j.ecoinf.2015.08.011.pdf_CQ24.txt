The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the model weights were "randomly initialized" and that the data set was "randomly split" into training and validation sets. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the model initialization and data splitting steps.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a trial-and-error method to determine the optimal number of neurons and learning rate, which may involve some degree of randomness in the search process. However, it does not provide further details on how randomness is handled or controlled in this process.

Overall, the context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query, and it is unclear what specific strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
