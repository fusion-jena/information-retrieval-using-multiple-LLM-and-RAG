Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image classification tasks, including the constitutive layers and tensor/vector shapes. It also mentions the availability of Mathematica notebooks used to define and train the CNNs, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
