The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are primarily based on the following methods:

1.  Data augmentation: This method involves training a model on a large dataset and then using the learned model to make predictions the data predictions. The model is trained on the entire and the data is used to make predictions abouticut<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

2.  Transfer learning: This method involves training a model on a small dataset and then using the learned model to make predictions on the data. The model is trained on the data and the data predictions are used to make predictions the predictions.
