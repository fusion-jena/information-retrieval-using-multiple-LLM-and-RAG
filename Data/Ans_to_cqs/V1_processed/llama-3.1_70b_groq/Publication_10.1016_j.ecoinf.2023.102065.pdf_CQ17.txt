Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The texts primarily focus on the applications of deep learning in various fields, such as birdsong recognition, soundscape classification, and bioacoustic classification, but do not delve into the specifics of regularization techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the text by Pouyanfar et al. (2018) provides a general overview of deep learning algorithms, techniques, and applications, but does not specifically discuss regularization methods.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
