Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on the configuration and performance of various machine learning models, including CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN, for predicting daily streamflow (Qflow). It discusses the importance of hyperparameter tuning, provides details on the structural architecture of the models, and lists the performance metrics (R, RMSE, and MAPE) for each model. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
