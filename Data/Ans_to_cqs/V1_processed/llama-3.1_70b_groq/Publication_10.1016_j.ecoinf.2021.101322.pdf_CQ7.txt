Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context only mentions the use of minibatch gradient descent during training and the number of epochs without improvement in validation error before training will terminate early, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, test, and validation sets. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
