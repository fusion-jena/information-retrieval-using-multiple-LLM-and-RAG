Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was trained on a server with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3090 GPU and that the goal was to "facilitate model deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices". However, it does not provide details on how the model was serialized, which platform was selected for deployment, or any other deployment-related steps.

The context only discusses the training process, including the choice of model (SegFormer), dataset (UGE-D), optimizer (AdamW), and hyperparameters. It also mentions the use of pre-trained weights and the training schedule, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I do not know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
