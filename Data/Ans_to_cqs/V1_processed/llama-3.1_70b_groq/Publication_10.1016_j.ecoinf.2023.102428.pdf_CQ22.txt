The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, Table 7 provides some information about the performance of the model, including:

* Training RMS (Root Mean Square)
* Testing RMS
* Accuracy Rate
* Skill measure (%)

These metrics suggest that the model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to minimize the error (RMS) and achieve high accuracy. However, precision and recall are not mentioned in the provided context.

It is worth noting that the context also discusses the evaluation of the LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) classification model using metrics such as:

* Producer's accuracy
* User's accuracy
* Overall accuracy
* Overall kappa statistics

These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the LULC maps produced. However, it is not clear if these metrics are also used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
