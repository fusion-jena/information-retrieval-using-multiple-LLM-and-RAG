The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) have the potential to generalize, in contrast to corresponding methods which adjust their performance based solely on their training data set. This suggests that the authors may have relied on the inherent properties of ELMs to ensure generalizability, but the specific measures taken are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a large dataset (Big Data) and the application of a Deep Learning algorithm (DELE) for the first time for the purpose of marine species identification. However, it does not provide information on whether techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset were employed to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
