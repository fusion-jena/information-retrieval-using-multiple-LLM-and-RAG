Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training of the model using different modes (incremental and zero-start) on different platforms (GPU server and desktop PC), but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

However, it does mention that the model was retrained on an extended training set to improve its accuracy, but this is related to the training process, not the deployment process. The context also mentions the use of the AlexNet model, which is a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model, but it does not provide information on how the model was serialized or deployed on a specific platform.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
