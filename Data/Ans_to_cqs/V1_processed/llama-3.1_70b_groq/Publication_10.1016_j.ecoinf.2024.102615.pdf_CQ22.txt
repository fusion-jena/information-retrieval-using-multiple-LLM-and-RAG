According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Correlation coefficient (R): measures the linear relationship between two variables, with values closer to 0 indicating a lesser correlation between the two variables.
2. Root mean square error (RMSE): measures the difference between predicted and actual values.
3. Mean absolute error (MAE): measures the average difference between predicted and actual values.
4. Coefficient of determination (R2): measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

These metrics are used to confirm the prediction performance of the model on the validation set.
