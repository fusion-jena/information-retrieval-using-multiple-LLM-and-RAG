The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the specific task of species identification or image filtering in camera trap data. However, it does mention the use of various deep learning techniques such as Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation (Zhu et al., 2017) for instance segmentation of animal species in video clips.

Additionally, the context mentions the work of Zhu et al. (2019) on "Searching for MobileNetV3", which is a paper on neural architecture search for mobile computer vision tasks. While this paper does not specifically focus on camera trap data or species identification, it does discuss optimization techniques for neural networks.

In the paper, Zhu et al. (2019) mention the use of a combination of optimization techniques such as Adam and SGD with momentum, as well as learning rate schedules and other techniques to optimize the neural network architecture search process.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it provides some indirect information on optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines for related tasks. However, without more specific information on the deep learning pipeline used for species identification or image filtering in camera trap data, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
