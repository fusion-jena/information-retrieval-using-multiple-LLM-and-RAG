Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to wildlife conservation, ecology, and habitat modeling, with references to research papers and datasets related to species occurrence records, habitat analysis, and conservation efforts.

However, I can tell you that the context does mention the collection of species occurrence records through on-the-ground observations and information provided by park rangers. Additionally, it mentions the use of remote sensing and data fusion for characterizing forest in wildlife habitat models, as referenced in the paper by Vogeler and Cohen (2016).

But, I couldn't find any information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. If you have any further questions or need more information on the context provided, I'll be happy to help.
