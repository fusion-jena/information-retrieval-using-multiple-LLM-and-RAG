The criteria used to determine when training is complete is referred to as "early stopping". According to the text, early stopping is the process that stops growing additional trees/layers/split when further addition of more trees/layers/split does not improve the validation statistic. In the case of a continuous response, the validation statistic included is the R2 value. This means that training is considered complete when the R2 value on the validation set stops improving.
