The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification. The model is designed to classify feature vectors after a training phase, similar to Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model is specifically used for fish species identification, where the label li âˆˆ {1, ..., L} represents the fish species. The model takes in a list of cropped thumbnails and their labels, and uses a GoogLeNet-inspired architecture with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier to classify the images. The model is trained on a database of images and their corresponding labels, and is used to classify new, unseen images.
