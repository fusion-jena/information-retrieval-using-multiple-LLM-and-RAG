Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context appears to be related to the output of a MaxEnt model, specifically the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables to the model, as well as the permutation importance of these variables. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
