Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of references and a brief discussion on the potential for improving a CNN model for object detection, but it does not provide details on the model's architecture or hyperparameters. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
