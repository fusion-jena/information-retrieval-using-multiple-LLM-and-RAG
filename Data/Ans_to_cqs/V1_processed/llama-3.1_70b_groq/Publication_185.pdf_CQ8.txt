I don't know. The provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the AlexNet architecture, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, and the feasibility of using small datasets to train deep learning models, but it does not provide information about the code repository.
