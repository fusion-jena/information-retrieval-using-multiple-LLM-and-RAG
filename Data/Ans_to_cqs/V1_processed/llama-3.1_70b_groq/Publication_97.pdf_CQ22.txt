The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two metrics: overall accuracy score and the mean value of intersection over union (MeanIoU). 

The overall accuracy score is computed as a fraction of correctly classified pixels and their total number. 

The MeanIoU is widely used in semantic segmentation because it allows for the handling of class-imbalanced cases, which are common when dealing with pixel-wise classification problems. The MeanIoU values are computed using the MeanIoU function from the Keras package for each threshold value in the interval [0.5, 1) with a step of 0.05, and the final average value of MeanIoU is computed.
