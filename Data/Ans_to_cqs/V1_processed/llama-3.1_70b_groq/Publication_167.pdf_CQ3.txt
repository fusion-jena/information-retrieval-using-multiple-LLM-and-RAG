The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "Water and settlements are constraint factors and can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed." This suggests that some form of manual annotation or interpretation is involved in the process, but the specific techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the input data is 40-dimensional and includes features such as LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, and distance to rivers. However, it does not provide information on how these features are annotated or labeled.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
