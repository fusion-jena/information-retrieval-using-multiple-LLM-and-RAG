The provided context does not specifically mention a deep learning model, but rather a classification model built upon the Monte Carlo method. However, it does discuss the importance of ensuring the generalizability of the model.

To address the issue of generalizability, the authors mention that they simulated climatic data using uniform distributions for the parameters θ and ρ (θ ∼ Unif (0, 2 π) and ρ ∼ Unif (0, 1)). This suggests that they attempted to cover a wide range of possible scenarios to make the model more robust.

Additionally, the authors mention that they set an arbitrary partition P := {0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1}, which might be related to the model's ability to handle different scenarios or conditions. However, it is not explicitly stated how this partition contributes to the model's generalizability.

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
