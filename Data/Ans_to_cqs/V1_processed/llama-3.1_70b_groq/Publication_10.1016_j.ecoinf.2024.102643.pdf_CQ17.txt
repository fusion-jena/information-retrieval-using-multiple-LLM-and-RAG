I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and conflict types between humans and animals, and lists various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Generalized Boosted Model, but does not provide information on regularization methods.
