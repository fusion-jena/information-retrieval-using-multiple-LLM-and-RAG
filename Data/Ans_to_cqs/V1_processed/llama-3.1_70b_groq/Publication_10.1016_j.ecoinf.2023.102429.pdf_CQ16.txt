The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that "parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values" which suggests that the training process may be evaluated using cross-validation and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. Additionally, the context mentions the use of epsilon-SVR, which is a type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that uses an epsilon-insensitive loss function. This loss function ignores errors within a certain range (epsilon) and penalizes errors larger than epsilon. However, it does not provide information on how the training process is stopped or when it is considered complete.
