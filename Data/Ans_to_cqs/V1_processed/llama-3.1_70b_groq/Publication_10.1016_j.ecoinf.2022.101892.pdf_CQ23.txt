To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset, and then fine-tuned on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets. This helps the model to learn general features that can be applied to different datasets.

Additionally, a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) cross-validation was applied to eliminate the influence of individuals. This means that the same subject did not appear in the training set and testing set at the same time, which helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is not biased towards specific individuals.

Furthermore, aggressive data augmentation was applied to the training sets to increase the diversity of the data. The original images were captured under different illumination and angles, and the training sets were randomly augmented via horizontal flipping.

Lastly, the model was tested on a large dataset (40,010 images) with batches of 100 images to quantify the maximum queries per second (QPS) achieved under real-world conditions. This helps to evaluate the model's performance on a large and diverse dataset.

Overall, the combination of pre-training on ImageNet, fine-tuning on PAD datasets, five-fold subject-exclusive cross-validation, data augmentation, and testing on a large dataset helps to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
