Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the process of subsetting background points, training individual models, and ensemble models, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
