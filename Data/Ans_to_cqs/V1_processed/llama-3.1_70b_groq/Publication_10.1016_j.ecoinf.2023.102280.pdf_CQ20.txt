I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions that deep learning-based denoising methods can be applied in sub-real time on "limited hardware" (Defossez et al., 2020), but it does not provide further details on the type of hardware used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
