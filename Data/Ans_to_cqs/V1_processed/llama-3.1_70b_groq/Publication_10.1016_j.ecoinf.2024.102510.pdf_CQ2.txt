The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data. The context mentions various datasets consisting of images of bird species, such as 1000 images of 3 bird species, 8057 images of 83 bird species, and 31,320 images of 29 bird species. The images are resized to specific dimensions (e.g., 224 × 224 × 3 and 299 × 299 × 3) for training and validation. There is no mention of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. However, it is worth noting that there are references to audio-based bird species classification in the provided context, but these appear to be separate studies and not directly related to the deep learning pipeline being described.
