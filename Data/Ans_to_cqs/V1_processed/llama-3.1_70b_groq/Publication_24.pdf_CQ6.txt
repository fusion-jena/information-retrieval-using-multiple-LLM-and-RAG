The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), include normalization. According to the provided context, the input to the network consisted of a 32 × 21 × 4 tensor, where each of the four channels was a spectrogram preprocessed using a different normalization strategy. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors applied different normalization strategies, which gave considerable improvements to network accuracy above any single normalization scheme in isolation. However, it does not specify the exact normalization strategies used.

The context also mentions other preprocessing methods that can be used for preprocessing spectrograms before they are used in machine learning, such as whitening (Lee, Pham, Largman, & Ng, 2009) and subtraction of mean values along each frequency bin (Aide et al., 2013). However, it is not clear if these methods were used in this specific study.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention any specific cleaning or scaling steps that were taken before training the model.
