I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of an automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm for soil salinity distribution mapping, but it does not provide any information about the optimization techniques used.
