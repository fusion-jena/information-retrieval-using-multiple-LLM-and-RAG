Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the Random Forest (RF) model with 25 trees as hyper-parameters achieved the highest accuracy, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
