The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that a balanced sampling was carried out for the test set, where one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was selected for each type of anuran call. This suggests that some form of random sampling was used to create the test set, but the specific strategy used to handle randomness is not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions that data augmentation was used, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. However, it does not provide further details on how data augmentation was implemented or how randomness was handled during this process.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query.
