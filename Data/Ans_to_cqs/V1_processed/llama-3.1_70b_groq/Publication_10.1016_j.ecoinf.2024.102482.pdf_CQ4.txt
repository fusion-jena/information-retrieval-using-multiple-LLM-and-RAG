Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to deep learning applications in ecology, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help improve the robustness and generalizability of a model. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering, among others.

If you are looking for information on data augmentation techniques, I would recommend searching for papers or articles that specifically focus on deep learning pipelines and data augmentation. The provided context does not provide the information you are looking for.
