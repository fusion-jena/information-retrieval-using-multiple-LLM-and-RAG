The text does not specifically mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it does mention the hyperparameters tuned for the Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost models. According to Table 2, the hyperparameters tuned for these models are:

* Maximum depth
* Number of estimators (n_estimators)
* Learning rate

The learning rate is mentioned as one of the hyperparameters, but the optimizer is not mentioned. The values of these hyperparameters for the RF and XGBoost models are provided in Table 2, but the text does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
