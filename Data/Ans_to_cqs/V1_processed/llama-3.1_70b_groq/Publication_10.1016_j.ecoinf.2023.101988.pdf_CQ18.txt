I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a research paper on ecological informatics, specifically discussing the use of audio recorders and human observers to survey wildlife species. The text includes tables and figures related to the results of the survey, as well as references to other studies. However, there is no mention of model performance or training, which suggests that the paper is focused on data collection and analysis rather than machine learning or model development. Therefore, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training.
