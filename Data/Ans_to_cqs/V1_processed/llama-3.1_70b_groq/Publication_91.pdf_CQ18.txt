The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance after training, such as accuracy, F-measure, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate. Additionally, it mentions that the learning rate was exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94, which suggests that the model's performance was monitored during training to adjust the learning rate. However, the specific strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training is not mentioned.
