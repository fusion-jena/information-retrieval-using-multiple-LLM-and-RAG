I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance. It appears to be discussing research on valve gaping in shellfish, data analysis, and the use of sensors and big data in aquaculture. There is no mention of machine learning or model training, so I am unable to provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
