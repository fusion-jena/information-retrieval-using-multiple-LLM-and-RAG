The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of aerial images and satellite imagery as sources of data. For example, in the context of training a CNN for whale detection, it is mentioned that "Whale images for training the CNN were mainly aerial images." Additionally, the context mentions the use of satellite imagery in conservation efforts, citing the importance of free satellite data for conservation.

It can also be inferred that public datasets may be used, as the context mentions the use of ImageNet, a large public dataset, in the paper "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Krizhevsky et al.

However, the context does not provide information on the use of surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. It is also worth noting that the context is focused on the use of deep learning techniques for image classification and object detection, rather than on the collection of raw data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline appear to include aerial images and satellite imagery, as well as public datasets such as ImageNet. However, the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of all methods used for collecting raw data.
