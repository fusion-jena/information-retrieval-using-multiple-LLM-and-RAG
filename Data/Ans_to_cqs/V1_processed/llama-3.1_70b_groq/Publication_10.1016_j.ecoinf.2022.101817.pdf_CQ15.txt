Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the CNN architecture (VGG16), the classification pipeline, and the performance of the CNN models on the ImageNet dataset. It also mentions some related research papers and conferences, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
