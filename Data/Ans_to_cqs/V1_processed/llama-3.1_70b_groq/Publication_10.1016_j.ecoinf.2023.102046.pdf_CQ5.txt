Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the models were trained on various datasets, but it does not provide the names of the datasets.

However, it does mention that CLIP was trained on 400 million images from the web along with their captions, but it does not specify the exact dataset. It also mentions that the models were fine-tuned on a specific dataset, but it does not provide the name of the dataset.

Additionally, it mentions that the Inception-V3 model was used for image classification, which is a common task in the ImageNet dataset. However, it does not explicitly state that ImageNet was used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
