Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on soil science, digital soil mapping, and related topics, with some mentions of machine learning and data visualization. However, it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models.

Some of the papers mentioned in the context discuss the use of machine learning techniques for soil classification, soil moisture estimation, and other related tasks. However, they do not provide details on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any additional context or information, I may be able to help further.
