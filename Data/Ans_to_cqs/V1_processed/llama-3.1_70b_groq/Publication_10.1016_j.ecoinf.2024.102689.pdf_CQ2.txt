Based on the provided context, the following data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline:

1. Image: Several studies have used MRI images (Journal of Physics: Conference Series) and photographs (Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval) as input data for deep learning models.
2. Audio: Laplante et al. (2021) used audio data for fish recognition in underwater environments.
3. Video: Spampinato et al. (2008) used low-quality unconstrained underwater videos for detecting, tracking, and counting fish. Måløy et al. (2019) used underwater videos for salmon feeding action recognition.
4. CSV: There is no explicit mention of CSV data format in the provided context.

It is worth noting that the context primarily focuses on computer vision and image processing applications, with a few instances of audio and video data usage. However, it does not provide an exhaustive list of all possible data formats used in deep learning pipelines.
