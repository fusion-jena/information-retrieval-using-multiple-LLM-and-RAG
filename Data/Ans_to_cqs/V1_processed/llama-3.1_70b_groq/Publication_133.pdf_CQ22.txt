The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and recall. Precision is defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. Recall is defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.

The model's performance is also evaluated using the average precision, which takes into account the trade-off between precision and recall. The average precision is calculated as the average of precision values over all observed recall values. This metric ranges between 0 and 1, with an ideal predictive model having an average precision of 1.

Accuracy is not explicitly mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the model's performance. However, the model's annotation accuracy is mentioned to increase as the number of training epochs increases.

Additionally, the model's performance is also evaluated using a plot that describes the performance attained by a model that accepts all identifications, as its True Classification Score (Tcs) is minimal (0). This plot can guide users in adjusting model parameters to their needs.
