I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It discusses the retrieval of Land Surface Temperature (LST) data from MODIS-TERRA sensor, the use of NDBI data from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, and the application of artificial neural networks (ANN) for modeling, but it does not provide information about a data repository link.
