Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text primarily focuses on the use of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for image processing and feature extraction from digitized herbarium sheets. It also discusses the use of transfer learning to reduce training time and improve model performance.

However, it does mention that the model was fine-tuned during training using the annotated herbarium scan dataset until convergence, but it does not provide details on any data augmentation techniques that may have been applied during this process.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
