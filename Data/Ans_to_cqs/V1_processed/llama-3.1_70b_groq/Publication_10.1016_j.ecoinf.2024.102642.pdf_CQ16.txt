The criteria used to determine when training is complete is an early stopping method. The patience parameter is set at 10 epochs for all training phases. This means that if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs, the training process is stopped, and the model weights from the previous epoch are retained. This approach helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.
