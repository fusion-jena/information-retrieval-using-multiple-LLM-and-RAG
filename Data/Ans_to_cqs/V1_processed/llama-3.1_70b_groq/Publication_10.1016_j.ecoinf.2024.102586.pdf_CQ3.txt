I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques or deep learning pipelines. It appears to be a passage about a study on invasive plant species, discussing data sources and analysis methods, specifically the use of random forest modeling to examine the relative importance of environmental and anthropogenic variables on invasive plant species richness and abundance. There is no mention of data annotation techniques or deep learning pipelines, so I am unable to provide a relevant answer.
