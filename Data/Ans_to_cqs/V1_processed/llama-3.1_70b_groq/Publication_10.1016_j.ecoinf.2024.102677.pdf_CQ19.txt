Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the architectures of the models used, such as Visual Geometry Group (VGG), Inception, and Residual Network (ResNet), but does not specify the frameworks used to implement these architectures. Therefore, I don't know which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning model.
