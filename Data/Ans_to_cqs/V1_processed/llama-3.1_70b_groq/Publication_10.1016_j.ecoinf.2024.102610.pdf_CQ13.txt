I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be focused on machine learning methodologies for predicting tsetse fly relative numbers, and it discusses variable elimination techniques for random forests, such as RFE and VSURF. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
