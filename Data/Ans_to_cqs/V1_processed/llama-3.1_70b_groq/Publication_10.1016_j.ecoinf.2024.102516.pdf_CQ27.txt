Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the training process, including the approach followed, the network setup, and the comparison with a baseline model. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
