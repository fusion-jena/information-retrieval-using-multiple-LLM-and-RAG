The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Accuracy
2. Fall-out
3. Precision
4. Specificity
5. Recall
6. F1-score

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models developed using Approaches 1 to 3, as shown in Table 1. The table provides the metric evaluations of the developed traceability models using different approaches and models, including EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and others.
