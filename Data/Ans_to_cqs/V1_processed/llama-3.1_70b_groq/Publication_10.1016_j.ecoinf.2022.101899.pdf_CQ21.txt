Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the model training process, specifically the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), and the interpretation of model results. It does not provide information on any postprocessing steps that may have been performed after the model training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
