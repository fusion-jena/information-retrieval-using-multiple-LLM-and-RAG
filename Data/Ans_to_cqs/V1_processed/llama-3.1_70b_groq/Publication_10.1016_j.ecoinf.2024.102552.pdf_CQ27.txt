I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the potential improvements for mixed-methods analytical historical ecology, the use of machine learning tools, and the limitations of machine learning methods for historical imagery. However, it does not provide information on the specific process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.
