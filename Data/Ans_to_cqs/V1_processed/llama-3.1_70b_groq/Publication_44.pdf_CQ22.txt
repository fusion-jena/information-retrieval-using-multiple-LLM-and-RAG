The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics are used to measure the difference between the predicted and actual values. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the best-performing model was selected based on the validation loss, which suggests that the model's performance was also evaluated using a loss function, specifically binary cross-entropy loss. However, it does not provide information on accuracy, precision, or recall, which are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models.
