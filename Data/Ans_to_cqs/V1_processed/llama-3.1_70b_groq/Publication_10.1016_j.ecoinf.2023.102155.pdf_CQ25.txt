The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. It appears to be discussing the ppmlasso package and its functions, such as ppmlassoMixEngine and ppmlassoLoopEngine, which are related to species distribution modeling and machine learning. The context mentions classification and predicted distribution, but it does not provide information on the purpose of a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
