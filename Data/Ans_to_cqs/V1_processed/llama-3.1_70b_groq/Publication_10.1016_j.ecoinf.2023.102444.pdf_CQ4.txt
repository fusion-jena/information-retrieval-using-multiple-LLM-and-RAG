I don't know. The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. It discusses dimensionality reduction methods (DRM), specifically UMAP, and its application in estimating species distribution based on bioclimatic variables. It also mentions the use of deep learning models in other studies, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in those models.
