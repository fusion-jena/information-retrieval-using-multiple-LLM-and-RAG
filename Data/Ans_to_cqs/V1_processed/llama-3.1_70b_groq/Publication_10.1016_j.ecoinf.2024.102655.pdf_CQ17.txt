Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on water quality monitoring, machine learning models, and the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality data for improving predictive models.

However, it does mention the overfitting problem in the context of Artificial Neural Networks (Bilbao, I., Bilbao, J., 2017). The authors discuss the overfitting problem and over-training in the era of data, particularly for Artificial Neural Networks, but they do not provide specific regularization methods to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
