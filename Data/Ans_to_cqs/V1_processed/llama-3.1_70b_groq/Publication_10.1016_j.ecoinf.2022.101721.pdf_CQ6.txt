Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on bat calls detection and classification using convolutional neural networks, but it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used.

However, it does mention the use of R-code (supplement S1) for predicting means, SDs, and population sizes based on observed data, which might involve some data preprocessing steps. Additionally, the context mentions the use of QGIS Geographic Information System and R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, which could potentially be used for data preprocessing.

But without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
