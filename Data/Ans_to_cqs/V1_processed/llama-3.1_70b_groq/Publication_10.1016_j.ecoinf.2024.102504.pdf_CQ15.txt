Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on various studies related to air quality, pollution, and environmental health, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline optimization techniques. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
