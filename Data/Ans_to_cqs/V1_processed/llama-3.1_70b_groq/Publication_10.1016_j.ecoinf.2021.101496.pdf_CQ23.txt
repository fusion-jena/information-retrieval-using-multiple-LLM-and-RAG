To ensure the generalizability of the artificial neural network (ANN) model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained and evaluated on a separate "test dataset" to assess its performance on unseen data. This helps to prevent overfitting and provides a more realistic estimate of the model's performance.

Additionally, the ANN was constructed empirically, and its performance was evaluated over 100 successful runs. This was done to account for the randomness in the model's optimization process, which can lead to different results in each run. By analyzing the model residuals over multiple runs, a more reliable evaluation of the model's performance was obtained.

However, there is no mention of using techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or using a diverse dataset to ensure the generalizability of the model. The text only mentions that the evaluation was performed on a "test dataset", but it does not provide further details on how this dataset was constructed or whether it was representative of the population.

Therefore, while some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the ANN model, it is unclear whether other techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.
