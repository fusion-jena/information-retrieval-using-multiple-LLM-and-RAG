The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The context mentions that the dataset consists of images of alates on sorghum leaves, and the models are trained to detect these alates. The images are at input resolutions of 640 × 640 pixels and 1280 × 1280 pixels. The context also mentions the use of a polygon tool in the labeling section of the cloud-based Roboflow environment to annotate the images, further confirming that the data format is image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
