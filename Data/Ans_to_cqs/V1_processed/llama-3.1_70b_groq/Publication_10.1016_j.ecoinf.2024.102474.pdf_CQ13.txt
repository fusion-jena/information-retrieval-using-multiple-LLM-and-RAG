Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. This suggests that the hyperparameters were optimized using a systematic approach, but the specific values or settings used are not provided in the given context.
