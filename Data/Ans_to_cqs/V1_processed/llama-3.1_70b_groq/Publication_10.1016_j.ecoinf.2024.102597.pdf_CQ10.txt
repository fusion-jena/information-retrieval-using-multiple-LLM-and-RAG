I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. In fact, it mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered but not used due to the limited number of samples. The context only discusses the development and evaluation of various machine learning models, including ensemble learning models, but does not provide any information about a code repository.
