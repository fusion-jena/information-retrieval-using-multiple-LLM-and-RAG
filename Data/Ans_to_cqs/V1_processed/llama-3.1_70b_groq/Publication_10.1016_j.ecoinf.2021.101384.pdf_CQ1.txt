The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of vessel tracking data, which can be collected through various methods such as:

* Vessel tracking systems (e.g., AIS, VMS)
* Satellite imagery
* Sensors on vessels
* Public datasets (e.g., Global Fishing Watch)

The context also mentions the use of the Global Fishing Watch dataset, which is a public dataset that provides information on fishing activity. Additionally, it mentions the use of CSV files, which can be used to collect and store data from various sources.

However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
