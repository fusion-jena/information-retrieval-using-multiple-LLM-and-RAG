The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the hyperparameter settings of different object detection algorithms (e.g., the optimizer and learning rate) are detailed in Table 2. Unfortunately, Table 2 is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
