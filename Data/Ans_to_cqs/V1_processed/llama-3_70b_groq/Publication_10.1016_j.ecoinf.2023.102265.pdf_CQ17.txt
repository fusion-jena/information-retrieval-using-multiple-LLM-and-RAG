Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different ResNet models, their training times, and validation accuracies, as well as the use of a ResNet-50 model for feature extraction and classification. It does not provide information on regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
