Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the YWnet model, including the SRC3 block, CBS block, SPPF block, and CRFPN, as well as their roles in feature extraction and fusion. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
