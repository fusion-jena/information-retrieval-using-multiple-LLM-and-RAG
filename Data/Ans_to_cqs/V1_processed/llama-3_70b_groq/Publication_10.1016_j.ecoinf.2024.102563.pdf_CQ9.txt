I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be related to a research study on digital soil mapping, remote sensing, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about the availability of a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
