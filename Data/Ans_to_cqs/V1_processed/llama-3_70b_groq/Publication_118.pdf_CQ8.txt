The provided context does not explicitly mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the architecture used was a heavily modified version of that used in "Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch" by github user "eelxpeng" (eelxpeng, 2018). This suggests that the original code repository might be available on GitHub, but it does not provide information about the modified version used in this research.

Therefore, I don't know the exact location of the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in this research.
