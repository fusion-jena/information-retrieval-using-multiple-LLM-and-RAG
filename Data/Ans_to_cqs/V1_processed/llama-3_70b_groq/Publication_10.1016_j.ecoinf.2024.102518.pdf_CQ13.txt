The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models, and the hyperparameters mentioned are related to the model tuning, specifically the feature class and regularization multiplier. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
