Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using drone imagery and remote sensing. The study uses drone-collected images of Pacific oysters in their natural habitats, which are then split into tiles for training and validation datasets. This suggests that the primary method of data collection is through aerial imagery captured by drones. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for data collection in this study.
