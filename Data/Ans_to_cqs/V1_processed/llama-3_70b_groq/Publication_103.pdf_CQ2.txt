Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The context mentions "imagenet classification", "computer vision tasks", and "image data" which suggests that the pipeline is working with image data. Additionally, the context mentions "herbarium specimens classification" and "non-dried plant images" which further supports the idea that image data is being used.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context. Similarly, there is no mention of CSV (Comma Separated Values) data format, which is typically used for tabular data.

Therefore, the answer is that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats.
