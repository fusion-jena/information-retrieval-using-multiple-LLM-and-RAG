I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to phylogenetic tree placement and distance-based methods, discussing the use of CNN models and simulated data sets for training. There is no mention of image-related tasks or annotation techniques that are commonly used in computer vision applications. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
