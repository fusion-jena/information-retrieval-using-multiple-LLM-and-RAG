Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on acoustic signal processing, species classification, and bioacoustics, with references to various research papers and reports.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "image data augmentation for deep learning" in one of the references, which could be related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of training datasets by applying random transformations to the data. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of deep learning models.

But, without more specific information, I don't know the exact strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values, in the context of the provided references.
