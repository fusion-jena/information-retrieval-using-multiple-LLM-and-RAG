Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of artificial neural networks, gradient boosting, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

However, it is mentioned that the model was trained on a validation dataset, and the model with the lowest error was chosen. This suggests that some form of model selection or evaluation was performed, but the details of this process are not provided. 

Without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
