Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the network setup, pre-training approach, and the importance of using additional external training data to improve the training results. It discusses the use of ResNet50, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and AdamW optimizer, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
