I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a collection of references and excerpts from various papers and articles related to machine learning, deep learning, and bird species recognition. There is no mention of a specific data repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
