The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on machine learning, bias-variance decomposition, and its application in river health predictions. It does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention bias-variance decomposition, which is a technique used to evaluate the generalizability of machine learning models. It decomposes the loss into bias, variance, and noise terms, which can help identify issues related to data bias. But it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
