The provided context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning pipeline datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions the use of species observation data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and field observations. The datasets obtained after applying the data pre-processing algorithm are also mentioned, which include one dataset for ET, one for WS, one for C, 7 for T, and 7 for P. These datasets are used as proxy environmental conditions for annual environmental snapshots in specific years. However, there is no mention of the datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
