The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that the cross-entropy cost function is used and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm is employed to optimize the model weights. It does not provide information on how to determine when the training process should stop. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
