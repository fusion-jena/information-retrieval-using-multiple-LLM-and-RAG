The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the same hyperparameters were used when training the model on different datasets (AT0 and AT1). It defines hyperparameters as "the parameters defining the architecture (number of layers, number and size of convolutions, connections between layers) and the training process of a Deep Model (learning rate, neurone activation, back-propagation computation)". However, it does not provide the specific values or settings used for these hyperparameters in the experiment. Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
