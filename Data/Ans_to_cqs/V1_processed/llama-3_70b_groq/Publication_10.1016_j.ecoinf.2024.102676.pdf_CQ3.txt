I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context discusses the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method, data preprocessing, and the use of machine learning models, but it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
