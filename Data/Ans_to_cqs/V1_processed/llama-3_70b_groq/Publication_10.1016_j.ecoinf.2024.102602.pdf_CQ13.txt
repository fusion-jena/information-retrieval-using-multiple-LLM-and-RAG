The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Optimizer: Adam optimizer algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 2015)
* Batch size: 10
* Number of epochs: 100
* Learning rates: The learning rates were chosen from empirical trials over 100 epochs, with two learning rates mentioned: 10^-4 and 10^-6.
