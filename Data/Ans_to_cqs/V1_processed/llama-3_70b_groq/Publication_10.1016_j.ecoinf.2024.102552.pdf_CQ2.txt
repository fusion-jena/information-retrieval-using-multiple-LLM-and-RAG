The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of imagery and spectral information from online spectral libraries and remote sensing products. It also mentions the use of four-band spectral information in NAIP imagery from 2009-present. 

Based on this information, it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the pipeline. However, there is no mention of audio or video data formats. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned as a data format used in the pipeline. 

It's worth noting that the context focuses on ecological informatics and remote sensing, which often involve working with image and spatial data. Therefore, it's possible that other data formats such as GeoTIFF or shapefiles might be used, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
