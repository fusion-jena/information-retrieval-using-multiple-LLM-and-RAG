The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the AlexNet convolutional neural network, are mentioned in the context. The stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer was used with default settings, except for the initial learning rate, which was set to 0.001, and the maximum number of epochs, which was set to 15.
