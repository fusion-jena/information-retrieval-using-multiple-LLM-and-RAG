I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper in ecological informatics, and it discusses a logistic regression model for predicting the risk probability of Hyphantria cunea spreading transmission. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
