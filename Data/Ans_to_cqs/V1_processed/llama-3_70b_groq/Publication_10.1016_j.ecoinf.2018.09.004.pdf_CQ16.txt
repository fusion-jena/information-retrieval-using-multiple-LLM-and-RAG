The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure, and discusses the use of cross-validation and stratiÔ¨Åed cross-validation for model evaluation. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria for determining when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
