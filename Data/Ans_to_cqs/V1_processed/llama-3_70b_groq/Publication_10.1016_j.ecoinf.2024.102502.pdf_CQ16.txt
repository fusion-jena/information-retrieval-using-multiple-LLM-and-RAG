I don't know.

The provided context does not mention training or validation loss plateau, which are typically concepts related to machine learning model training. The context appears to be discussing data filtering, temporal scaling, and workflow applicability in the context of Earth Engine and satellite data. There is no mention of training or model evaluation, so it is not possible to determine the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
