The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that data preprocessing is performed using the Librosa library, and Figure 8 shows the data preprocessing stages.

According to Figure 8, the acquired audio files are transmitted over 4G using SMTP, and then the audio file is segmented into 15-second windows. Each of the sample windows is passed to the feature extractor function, where Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are used to extract features for the classifier.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the preprocessing steps involved include audio file segmentation and feature extraction using MFCC. However, it is not clear if any other preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are performed.
