I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It discusses the proposed framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction, the evaluation metrics used, and the results of the model's training and validation. However, it does not provide information about the specific architecture of the deep learning model, such as whether it is a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or something else.
