According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization techniques. These techniques are provided by the Keras Tuner, which also offers Random Search as an option. However, it is mentioned that Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization are superior to other search algorithms available in the Keras Tuner, which is why they were chosen for this particular task. There is no mention of grid search being used for hyperparameter optimization in the provided context.
