To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait was extracted and set aside as a 'test dataset' for independent evaluation of the trained models. This test dataset was not involved in the training process. 

Additionally, the remaining data was split into 'training dataset' and 'validation dataset' by a ratio of 4:1. This split allowed for the evaluation of the model's performance during training and helped in identifying overfitting.

Furthermore, a 3-fold cross-validation was employed to assess the final model performance. This involved creating three different training, validation, and test splits, which helped in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data and reducing overfitting.

Lastly, a stratified sampling design was used to acquire a sufficient amount of training data while balancing the taxonomic evenness. This ensured that the model was trained on a diverse dataset, which is essential for generalizability.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include a separate test dataset, a validation dataset, 3-fold cross-validation, and a stratified sampling design.
