According to the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is the overall accuracy (OA). This is mentioned in the "Results and Discussion" section, where it is stated that the authors adjusted three parameters and used the hold-out method to distinguish the test set and the training set, and then evaluated the performance using the overall accuracy (OA) as a metric. There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
