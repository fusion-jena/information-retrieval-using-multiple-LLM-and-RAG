The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on feature selection, classification models, and data fusion, but it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques.

However, it's worth noting that the context does mention cross-validation, which is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model and prevent overfitting. Additionally, the context mentions Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection, which can help reduce the impact of noisy or irrelevant features on the model.

But, it does not provide any information about addressing data bias during preprocessing using techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
