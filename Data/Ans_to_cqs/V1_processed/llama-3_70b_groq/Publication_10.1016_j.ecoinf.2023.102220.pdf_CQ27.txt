I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the implementation of different machine learning methods, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and their comparison with the PBP method. It also mentions the implementation of these methods in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
