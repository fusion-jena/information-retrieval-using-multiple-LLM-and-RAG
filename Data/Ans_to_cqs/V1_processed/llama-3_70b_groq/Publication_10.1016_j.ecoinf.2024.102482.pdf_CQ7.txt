Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context only provides information about the composition of the experiments' data sets in Table 3, which shows the number of observations and frames for each data set type (training, validation, and test). However, it does not explain how the data was split into these sets.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
