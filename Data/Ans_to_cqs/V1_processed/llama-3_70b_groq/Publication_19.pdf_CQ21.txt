Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Conversion to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model: The best-trained Inception-V3 model was converted to TFLite, which reduced the model size from 175 MB to 87 MB.

2. Metrics calculation: The accuracy and macro-average F1-score were calculated for the TFLite model. The accuracy was reduced to 92% (from 93%), and the macro-average F1-score was reduced to 0.90 (from 0.93).

3. Confusion matrix calculation: A confusion matrix was generated for the TFLite Inception-V3 model, which is shown in Table V.

4. ROC curve generation: ROC curves were generated for the TFLite model, which are shown in Fig. 9.

There is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. It is possible that other postprocessing steps were performed, but they are not mentioned in the provided text.
