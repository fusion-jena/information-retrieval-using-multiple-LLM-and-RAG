The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the learning rates were chosen from empirical trials over 100 epochs, with and without a batch size of 10. However, it does not specify whether a grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
