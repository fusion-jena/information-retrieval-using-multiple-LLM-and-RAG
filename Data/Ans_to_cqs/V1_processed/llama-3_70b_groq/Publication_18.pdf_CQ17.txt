The provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss two techniques used to overcome the limitations of building datasets from scratch: transfer learning and data-augmentation. Data-augmentation can be seen as a form of regularization, as it increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs by applying transformations to the training images. 

However, the context does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
