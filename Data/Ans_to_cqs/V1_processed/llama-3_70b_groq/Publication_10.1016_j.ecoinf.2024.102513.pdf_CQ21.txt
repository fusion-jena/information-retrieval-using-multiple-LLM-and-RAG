Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training configuration, classification accuracy, and the architecture of the neural network model used for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification. 

However, it does mention the calculation of classification accuracy, which implies that some form of metrics calculation is involved. But the specific metrics used or other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
