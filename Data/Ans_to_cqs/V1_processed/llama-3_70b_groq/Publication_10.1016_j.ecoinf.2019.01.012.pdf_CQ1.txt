Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in image classification, particularly in the field of agriculture and environmental sciences. It discusses the advantages of deep learning, the importance of large amounts of labeled training data, and the suitability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline might include digital images, as the context mentions the automatic classification of digital images and the use of CNNs for image analysis. The images might be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, but the context does not provide specific information on these methods.

In the context of environmental sciences and agriculture, the raw data might be collected through sensors, such as cameras mounted on drones or satellites, or through surveys and field observations. Public datasets might also be used, but the context does not provide specific examples or details on these methods.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that digital images might be used, and the collection methods might include surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, more information is needed to provide a specific answer to this query.
