The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the parameter settings used for the Res_AUNet network, such as the batch size, initial learning rate, and learning rate adjustment strategy. However, it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were chosen or optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
