Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the CityNet model, its application in urban ecoacoustic assessment, and its comparison with another model called bulbul. 

However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation or testing is being performed, as the context mentions metrics such as True Positives, False Negatives, and True Negatives. Additionally, a table (Table 2) is mentioned, which might contain some evaluation metrics or results. 

But, specific postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
