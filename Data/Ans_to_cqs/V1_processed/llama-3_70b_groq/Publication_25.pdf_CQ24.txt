The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, particularly in remote sensing, due to the lack of large training datasets. It discusses approaches like self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning to address this limitation.

The context does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
