The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rate. These metrics are calculated using the Python package sklearn and plotted using the package matplotlib.
