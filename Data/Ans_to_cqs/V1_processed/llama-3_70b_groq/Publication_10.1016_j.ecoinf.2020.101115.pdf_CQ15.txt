I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses the application of machine learning in marine science, image recognition, and automation of fish aging, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
