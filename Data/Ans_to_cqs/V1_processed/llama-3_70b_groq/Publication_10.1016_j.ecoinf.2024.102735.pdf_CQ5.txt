I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to water quality and harmful algal blooms (HABs) monitoring and prediction. It mentions various models and techniques, such as random forest, multilayer perceptron, long-short term memory, and support vector regression, but does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
