The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of Kaleidoscope Pro for sound detection and the potential limitations of the approach due to geographical song variations. It also mentions the possibility of creating more advanced classifiers using machine learning or convolutional neural networks in future studies.

However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
