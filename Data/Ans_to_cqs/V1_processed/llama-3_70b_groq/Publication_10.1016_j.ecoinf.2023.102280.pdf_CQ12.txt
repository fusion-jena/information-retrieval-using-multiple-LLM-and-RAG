The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that U-net architecture, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is commonly used in deep noise reduction methods. Additionally, transformer attention mechanisms have also been applied with great success in some studies. Therefore, it can be inferred that both CNN and Transformer models are used in the pipeline, but the specific model used is not specified.
