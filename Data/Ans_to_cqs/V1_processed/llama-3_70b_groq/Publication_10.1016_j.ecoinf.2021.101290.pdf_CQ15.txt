Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on various topics like deep learning frameworks, event-stream processing, machine learning, and optogenetics. 

However, it does mention deep learning frameworks like Theano, Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow, and deeplearning4j, which often employ optimization techniques like SGD, Adam, RMSProp, and others. But the context does not provide specific information about these techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
