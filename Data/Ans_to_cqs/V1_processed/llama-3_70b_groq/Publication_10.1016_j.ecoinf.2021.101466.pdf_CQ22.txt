The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F-measure. These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, such as YOLOv4 and EfficientNet, with and without random erasing. Additionally, IoU (Intersection over Union) is used as a threshold to determine correct or incorrect detection results, with a threshold of 0.3 used in this paper.
