I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to research papers and articles on deep learning models for fish passage monitoring and object detection, but it does not provide information on a data repository link. The papers cited are from various sources such as IEEE, Trans. Chin. Soc. Agric. Machin., Water, and Comput. Electron. Agric., but none of them provide a link to a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
