The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. This is inferred from the context, specifically in the section "B. Computer Vision Approaches/Pipelines" where it is mentioned that the pipeline is used to classify leaf-scan images into species. This suggests that the input data to the deep learning pipeline are images.
