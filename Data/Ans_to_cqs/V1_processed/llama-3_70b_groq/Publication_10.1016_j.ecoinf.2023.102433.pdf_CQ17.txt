I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to a NASA web service API, smart farming applications, and data management, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
