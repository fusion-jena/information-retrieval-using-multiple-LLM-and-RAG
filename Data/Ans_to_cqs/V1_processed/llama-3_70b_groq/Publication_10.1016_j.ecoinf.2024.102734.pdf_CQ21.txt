The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the model training process, including the evaluation of model performance during training using an 80/20% training-validation split, and the reporting of both validation and test dataset performance. However, it does not specify the exact postprocessing steps, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of saliency maps, or generation of confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
