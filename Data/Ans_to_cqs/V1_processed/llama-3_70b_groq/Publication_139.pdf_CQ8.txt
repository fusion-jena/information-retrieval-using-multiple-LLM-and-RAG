Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the application of deep learning approaches to environmental acoustic monitoring, the limitations of these approaches, and the design of a neural network architecture that can be retrained in under 20 minutes. However, it does not provide information about the availability of the code or its repository. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
