Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text discusses the use of Genetic Programming (GP) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for streamflow forecasting, but it does not provide details on the training process or the stopping criteria.

The context mentions that the Eureka Pro software is used for GP modeling, and it provides information on the data split for training and testing, but it does not specify how the training process is terminated. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
