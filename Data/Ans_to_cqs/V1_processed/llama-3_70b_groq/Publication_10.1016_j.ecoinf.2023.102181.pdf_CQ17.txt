The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models with clustered data, discussing techniques like covariance-weighted bagging and spatial autocorrelation. It does not provide information on regularization methods commonly used in deep learning.

However, it does mention "regularization behaviour of the bagging model" in the context of covariance-weighted bagging, but it does not elaborate on specific regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
