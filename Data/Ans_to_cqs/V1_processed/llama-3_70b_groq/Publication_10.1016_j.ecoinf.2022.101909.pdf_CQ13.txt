I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The text only describes the architecture of the model, which is based on ResNet50, and mentions that it was fine-tuned for the target task. It also mentions the use of dropout to reduce overfitting, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
