I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to an equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool, discussing environmental justice indices, geospatial distribution, and best management practices (BMPs) for reducing pollutants. There is no mention of deep learning models, datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
