I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context primarily discusses the development of FRAMES, a framework for reporting data and metadata for earth systems, and the NGEE Tropics Archive, a data repository. It mentions the use of Django, a Python web framework, and Foundation, a front-end framework, for building the NGEE Tropics Archive's web portal, but it does not provide information about the deployment of a deep learning model.
