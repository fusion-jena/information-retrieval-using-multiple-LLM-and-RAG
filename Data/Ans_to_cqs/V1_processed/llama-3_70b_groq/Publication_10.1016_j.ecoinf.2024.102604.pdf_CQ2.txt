I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and environmental covariates, but it does not provide information about data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the data formats used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
