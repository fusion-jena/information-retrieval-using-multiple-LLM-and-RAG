Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and U-Net architectures for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, particularly in the domain of plant species identification and crop monitoring using UAV imagery. While it discusses data augmentation as a technique to improve model performance, it does not delve into regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
