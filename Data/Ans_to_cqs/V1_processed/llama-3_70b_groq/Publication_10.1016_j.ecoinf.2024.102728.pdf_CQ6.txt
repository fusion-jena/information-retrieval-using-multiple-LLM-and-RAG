Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references from various fields such as ecology, archaeology, and computer science, but it does not provide specific information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, based on general knowledge, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numerical features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming numerical features to a common scale, such as standardization or feature scaling
* Data transformation: converting data types, such as converting categorical variables into numerical variables
* Feature selection: selecting a subset of relevant features to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data

Please note that these preprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture.
