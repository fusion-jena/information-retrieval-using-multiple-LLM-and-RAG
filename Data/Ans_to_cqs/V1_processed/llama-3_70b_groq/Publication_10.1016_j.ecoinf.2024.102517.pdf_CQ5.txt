The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context mentions a custom dataset comprising clean bird sounds, with 1568 clean bird sound segments, each ranging from 4 to 20 seconds in duration. A subset of 68 segments was randomly selected as the clean bird sound test set. There is no mention of any other datasets being used in the experiment.
