The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. The model is trained using satellite imagery and is capable of classifying the target PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) based on its format, which includes spatial resolution, spectral band, interval, and chronological order of each band. The classification part of the model enables PCF (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry-based Crop Field) land monitoring.
