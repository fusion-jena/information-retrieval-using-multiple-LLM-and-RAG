The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the training process, dataset preparation, and evaluation metrics (accuracy results) but does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it is mentioned that for the ResNet50 evaluation, random ten-crop testing is used with smaller data augmentation parameters than those used during training. This suggests that some form of testing or evaluation is performed after training, but the exact postprocessing steps are not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
