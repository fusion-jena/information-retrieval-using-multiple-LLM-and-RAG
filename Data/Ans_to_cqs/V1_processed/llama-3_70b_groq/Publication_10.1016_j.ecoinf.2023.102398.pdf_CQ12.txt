The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is YOLOv5, which is a variant of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the mention of "YOLOv5 COCO training from scratch" in Table 2, which lists the hyperparameters used in training the proposed model. Additionally, the input image size of 416 and the use of a GPU (Tesla T4) and CUDA Version-12.0 in Google Colab also suggest that a CNN-based model is being used.
