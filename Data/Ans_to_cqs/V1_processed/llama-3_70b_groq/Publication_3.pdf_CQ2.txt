Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses audio data, specifically spectrograms, which are visual representations of audio signals. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. The context mentions the use of CNNs for image classification tasks, but it seems that in this specific research, the focus is on audio signal analysis for species identification.
