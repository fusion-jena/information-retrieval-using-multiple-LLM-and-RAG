The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning analysis can be performed using Tensorflow, a machine learning and artificial intelligence open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team. However, it does not specify the type of model used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
