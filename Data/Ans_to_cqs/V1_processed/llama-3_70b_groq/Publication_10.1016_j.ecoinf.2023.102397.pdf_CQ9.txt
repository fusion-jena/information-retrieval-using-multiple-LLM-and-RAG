I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is stored. The context mentions various research papers and tools used for species distribution modeling, acoustic data analysis, and automated biodiversity monitoring, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
