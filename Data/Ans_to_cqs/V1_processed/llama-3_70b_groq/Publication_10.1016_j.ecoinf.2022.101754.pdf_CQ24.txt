Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the estimation of above-ground biomass in forests using machine learning methods, including AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression. It discusses the training and validation set, regression models, and model evaluation. However, it does not provide information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
