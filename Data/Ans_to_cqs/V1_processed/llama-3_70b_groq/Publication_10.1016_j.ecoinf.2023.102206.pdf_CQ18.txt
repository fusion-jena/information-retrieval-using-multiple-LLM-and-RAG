I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the concept of transfer learning, overconfidence, and hesitancy in decision-making, as well as the proposed approach of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) and its application to GDP prediction using CO2 emission data. It also compares the performance of IFTL with other approaches such as FTL, GRNN, and SVR. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
