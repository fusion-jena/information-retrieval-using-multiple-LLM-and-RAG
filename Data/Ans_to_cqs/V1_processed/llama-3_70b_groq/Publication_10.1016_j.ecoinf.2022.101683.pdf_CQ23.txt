The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was evaluated on two different test datasets (Test set #1 and Test set #2) which suggests that some form of cross-validation or data splitting was used. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a random 75% subset of the data (Training set) and evaluated on the remaining 25% (Test set #1) which is a common practice in machine learning to prevent overfitting and ensure generalizability. 

However, there is no mention of a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other techniques to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken.
