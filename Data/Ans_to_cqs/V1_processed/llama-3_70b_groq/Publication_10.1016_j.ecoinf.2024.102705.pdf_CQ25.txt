The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection. 

The text mentions the use of the YOLOv3 model, which is a real-time object detection system. Additionally, the evaluation metric used is Average Precision (AP), which is commonly used in object detection tasks to evaluate the performance of models. The text also mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, such as random adjustments to image size, image flipping, cropping, and conversion, which are typically used in object detection tasks. Furthermore, the text mentions the use of the Adam optimizer, which is a popular optimizer used in many deep learning models, including object detection models. Overall, based on the context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model is to detect objects in images.
