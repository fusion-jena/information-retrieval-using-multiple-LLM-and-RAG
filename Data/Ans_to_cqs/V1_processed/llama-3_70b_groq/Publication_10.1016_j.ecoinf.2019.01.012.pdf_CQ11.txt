I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification, and provides details on the training process and architecture used. However, it does not provide information on where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a specific repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
