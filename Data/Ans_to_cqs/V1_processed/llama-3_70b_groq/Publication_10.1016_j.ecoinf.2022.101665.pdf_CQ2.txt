Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be related to environmental variables such as above-ground biomass, soil carbon stock, and land cover change, which are commonly produced using spatially exhaustive Earth observation imagery, climatic data, and terrain variables derived from digital elevation models as predictors.

The context mentions the use of digital elevation models, which suggests that the data formats may include raster or grid-based data. Additionally, the mention of Earth observation imagery implies that the data formats may include image data. However, the specific formats, such as GeoTIFF or JPEG, are not mentioned.

The context also mentions the use of climatic data, which may be in the form of CSV or other tabular formats. The appendix provides a list of data sources, including CHESLA climate data, SoilGrids, and Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, which may provide additional information on the data formats used.

In summary, while the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that they likely include image, raster, or grid-based data, as well as tabular data in CSV or other formats.
