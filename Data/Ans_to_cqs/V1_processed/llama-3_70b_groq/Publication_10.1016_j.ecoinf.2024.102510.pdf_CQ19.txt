Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context discusses various deep learning models such as MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, GoogleNet, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, ResNet18, InceptionResNetV2, and NASNetMobile, but it does not specify the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
