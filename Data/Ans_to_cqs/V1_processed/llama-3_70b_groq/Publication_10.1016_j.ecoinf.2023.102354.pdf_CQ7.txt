I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to drought characteristics, groundwater-climate interactions, and the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region, but it does not provide information on data splitting for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
