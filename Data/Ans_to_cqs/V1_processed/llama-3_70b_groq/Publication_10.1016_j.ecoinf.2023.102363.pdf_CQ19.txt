The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that the training was conducted within the Google Collaboratory 'Colab' platform, which is a cloud-based environment for data science and machine learning. It does not provide information about the specific framework used, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
