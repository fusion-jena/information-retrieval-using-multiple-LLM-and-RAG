Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research article or study that uses various datasets, including Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and PlanetScope, for cloud detection and land use classification. It provides information about the datasets, spatial resolution, acquisition periods, and other details, but it does not discuss the deployment of a trained deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
