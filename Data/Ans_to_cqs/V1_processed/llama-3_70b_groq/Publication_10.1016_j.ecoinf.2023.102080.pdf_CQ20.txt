The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. It only mentions that the analyses were run using a 10-core central processing unit (CPU) strategy with AMD EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster. Therefore, it can be inferred that the computations were performed using CPUs, but there is no information about the use of GPUs, TPUs, or deep learning models.
