Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the data collection, model training, and prediction procedures, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
