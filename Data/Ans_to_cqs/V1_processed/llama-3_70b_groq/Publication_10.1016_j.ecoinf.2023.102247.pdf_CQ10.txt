I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a research paper discussing species distribution modeling using ensemble modeling approaches in R, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
