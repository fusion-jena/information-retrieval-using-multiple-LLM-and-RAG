The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information available, it appears to be a classification model. The context mentions a "classification table" (Table 4) that shows the observed and forecast values of a variable Y, along with the correct percentage and overall percentage. This suggests that the model is predicting a categorical variable Y, which is a common task in classification problems. Additionally, the context does not provide any information that would suggest the model is performing segmentation or detection tasks. Therefore, based on the available information, it is likely that the purpose of the deep learning model is classification.
