The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture and training process of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, but does not mention the framework used to implement it. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used to build the model.
