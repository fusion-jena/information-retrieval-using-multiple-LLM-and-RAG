Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) and recall, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during the training process.

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using the mentioned metrics, but the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the performance during training is not mentioned.
