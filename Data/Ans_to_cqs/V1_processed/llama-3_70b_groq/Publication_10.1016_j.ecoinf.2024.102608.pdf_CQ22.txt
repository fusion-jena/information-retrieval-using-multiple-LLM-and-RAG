The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in this context are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). These metrics are used to measure the discrepancy between the model's predicted and observed values. MAE is a popular statistic that measures the average difference between predicted and observed values, and it is less sensitive to outliers. RMSE is the average squared deviation from the expected value, and it is used to compare a model's predictions to the actual values. R2 is a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the data. Models with higher R2 values and lower RMSE and MAE values are considered more appropriate for estimating water quality parameters.
