Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, habitat suitability, and optimization algorithms, but it does not provide information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. If you're looking for general information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, common steps include normalization, scaling, feature scaling, handling missing values, data augmentation, and data cleaning. However, this information is not derived from the provided context.
