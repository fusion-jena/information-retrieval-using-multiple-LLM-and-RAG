The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It does not mention cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other specific techniques to ensure generalizability. 

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a diverse dataset, as it includes thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species, and environment. The dataset also includes multiple species of fish, which suggests that the model was trained on a diverse set of samples. 

Additionally, the model was trained on four different datasets (T1, T2, T3, and T4), which might have helped to improve its generalizability. The differences between these datasets are not clearly explained, but it is mentioned that T4 was the most complete dataset and provided the best identification rate after post-processing.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on measures taken to ensure generalizability, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a diverse dataset, and the use of multiple datasets might have helped to improve its generalizability.
