I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the concept of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), their architecture, and their application in representation learning and unsupervised learning tasks. It also presents a specific example of using VAEs for visualizing latent representations of unlabelled field data and test species. However, it does not provide information about the data repository where the deep learning pipeline is stored.
