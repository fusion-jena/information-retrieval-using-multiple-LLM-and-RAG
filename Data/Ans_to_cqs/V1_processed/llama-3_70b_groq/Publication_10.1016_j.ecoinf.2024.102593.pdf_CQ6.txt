Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep neural networks (DNNs) in bioacoustics, specifically for bird species classification, and discusses techniques such as dimensionality reduction, active learning, and analysis of embeddings. 

While it is common to perform preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a deep learning model, these steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given information.
