The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information about the datasets used and their corresponding training and testing sets. 

For instance, the dataset contains 638 images, divided into seven categories, with 510 images for training and 128 for testing. Similarly, the trash-ICRA19 dataset includes 1144 images across three categories, with 915 images for training and 229 for testing. 

Although the context does not provide specific criteria for splitting the data, it can be inferred that the datasets are split randomly into training and testing sets based on the number of images in each category. Typically, in deep learning model training, the data is split into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 80:10:10 or 70:15:15, but this information is not provided in the given context.
