I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of Random Forest and MTMI-SMF algorithms, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. It mentions the use of 5 K-Folds for training and testing the models, but it does not specify how the hyperparameters are tuned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
