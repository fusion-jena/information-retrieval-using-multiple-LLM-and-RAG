Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the results of the XGBoost model, including the accuracy of land use/land cover classification and forest types, as well as the spatial distribution of forest types. It does not provide information on the training process or the strategies used to monitor model performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
