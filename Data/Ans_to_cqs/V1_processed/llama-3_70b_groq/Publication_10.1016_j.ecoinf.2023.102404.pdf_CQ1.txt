Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of remote sensing technologies, such as:

1. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery: As mentioned in Tamiminia et al. (2021), UAS imagery is used to estimate shrub willow biomass.
2. Airborne LiDAR data: Tamiminia et al. (2021a) and Hudak et al. (2020) mention the use of airborne LiDAR data for forest above-ground biomass estimation.
3. Landsat data: Tamiminia et al. (2021a) combine airborne LiDAR data with Landsat data for forest above-ground biomass estimation.
4. GEDI and ICESat-2 data: Tamiminia et al. (2022) integrate GEDI and ICESat-2 data for mapping canopy height of China's forests.
5. Sentinel-1 SAR data: Mandal et al. (2020) use Sentinel-1 SAR data for crop growth monitoring.

It does not appear that surveys or public datasets are used for raw data collection in these specific studies. However, it is possible that public datasets may be used in other deep learning pipelines.
