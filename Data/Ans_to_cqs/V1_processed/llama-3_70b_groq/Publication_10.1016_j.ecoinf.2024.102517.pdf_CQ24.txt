The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that in each epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the training process, but the specific strategy to handle it is not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions that 68 clean bird sound segments were randomly selected as the test set, and noise segments were randomly selected from the noise training set to generate noisy bird sounds with different SNRs. This implies that randomness is involved in the data selection process as well.

However, the context does not provide information on how the randomness is handled or controlled, such as setting a random seed value, to ensure reproducibility of the results. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
