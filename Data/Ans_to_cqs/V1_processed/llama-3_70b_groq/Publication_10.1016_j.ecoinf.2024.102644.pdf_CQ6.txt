Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper discussing wetland basins, evapotranspiration, water surplus, conductivity, temperature, and precipitation, as well as references to various publications on ecological niche models and species distribution maps. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
