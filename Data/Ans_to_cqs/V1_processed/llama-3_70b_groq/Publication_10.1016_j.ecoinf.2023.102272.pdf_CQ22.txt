Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and AUC (Area Under the Curve). 

The accuracy is mentioned in the section 3.2, where it is stated that "the best validation accuracies were achieved by model 12 in all the years (accuracy = 0.833 ± 0.005; mean of years ± sd)". 

The AUC is mentioned in Table 2, which shows the predictive performance obtained with testing sets. The AUC is provided for each class and each year, along with the mean and standard deviation.

There is no mention of precision and recall in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
