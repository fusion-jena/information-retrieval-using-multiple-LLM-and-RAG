The hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are the CPU and GPU. Specifically, the cyber system used for training the CNN is based on a workstation with an AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor with 32 GB RAM and GPU NVIDIA Quadro P620, running Windows 10 Pro. Additionally, the TensorFlow Lite library is used for training the CNN on the CPU.
