The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling and climate change, and it discusses the use of an ensemble modeling approach in BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of study species. It also mentions the use of cross-validation to test model performance and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as an index to specify model accuracy.

However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
