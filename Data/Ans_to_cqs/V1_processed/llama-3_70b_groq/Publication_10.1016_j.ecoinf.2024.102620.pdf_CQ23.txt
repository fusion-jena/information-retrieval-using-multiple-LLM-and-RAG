The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The PLUS model is described as consisting of two main modules: the transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). The LEAS module employs the random forest algorithm, not a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, as one is not present in the described model.
