I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the experimental configurations, training mechanisms, dataset types, and hyper-parameters used for the experiments, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
