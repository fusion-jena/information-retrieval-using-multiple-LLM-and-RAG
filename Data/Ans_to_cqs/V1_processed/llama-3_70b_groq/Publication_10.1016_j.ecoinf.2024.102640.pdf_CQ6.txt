Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of two specific models, SegFormer and EPDNet, without discussing preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, data augmentation, and feature engineering, depending on the specific problem and dataset. 

Since the context does not provide specific information about preprocessing, it is impossible to determine the exact steps taken for the models mentioned. If you need information on preprocessing steps, it is recommended to consult the original papers or documentation related to the models or datasets used.
