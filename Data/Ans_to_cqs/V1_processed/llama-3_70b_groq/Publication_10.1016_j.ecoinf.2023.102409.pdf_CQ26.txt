Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the Unet and Pspnet models, as well as the experimental setup and hyperparameters used for training. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
