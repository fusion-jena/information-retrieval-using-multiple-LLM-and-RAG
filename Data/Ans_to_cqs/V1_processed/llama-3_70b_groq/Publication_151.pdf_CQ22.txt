The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The context only mentions the loss function (equation 1) that is used to train the CNN model, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance is evaluated. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
