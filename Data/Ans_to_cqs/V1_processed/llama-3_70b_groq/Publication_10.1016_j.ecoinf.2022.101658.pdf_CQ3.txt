The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "manual classification of fuel types used in semantic segmentation training and testing" which suggests that the data annotation technique used is semantic segmentation. 

Semantic segmentation is a type of image annotation where each pixel in an image is labeled with a class or category. This is different from bounding box annotation, where a bounding box is drawn around objects of interest, and instance segmentation, where individual objects are annotated with a mask.

The context also mentions that the data collected at Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL) were used for training and testing the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm. This further supports the idea that semantic segmentation is the data annotation technique used in this pipeline.

However, it does not provide any information about bounding box annotation or instance segmentation being used in the pipeline.
