Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of a CNN-based object detection model, including the RPN module, regressor, classifier, and RoI pooling layer. It also discusses the loss function and IoU calculation, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
