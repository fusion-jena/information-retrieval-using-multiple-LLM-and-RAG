I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a different topic, discussing measures and data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km, and mentioning the nine-cell approach and its effect on prediction results. There is no mention of deep learning, annotation techniques, or related concepts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
