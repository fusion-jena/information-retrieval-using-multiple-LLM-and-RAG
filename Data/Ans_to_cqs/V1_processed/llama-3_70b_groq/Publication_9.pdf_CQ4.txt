I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques in ecology and evolutionary biology, highlighting the utility of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their potential for automating data collection and image analysis. While it mentions the importance of training neural networks and optimizing model weights, it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
