I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image segmentation and classification tasks in remote sensing. It discusses the use of CNNs for end-to-end classification, learning features from input datasets, and presenting increasing complexity through network layers. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
