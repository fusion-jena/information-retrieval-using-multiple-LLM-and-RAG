I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of BirdNET, a research project for automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, and its application in ecological informatics. It discusses the settings and parameters used in BirdNET, such as detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold, but does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
