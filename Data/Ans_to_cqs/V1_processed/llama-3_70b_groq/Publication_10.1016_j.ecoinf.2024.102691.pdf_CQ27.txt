I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, including the input image size, batch size, optimizer, and learning rate. It also explains the architecture of the depth-attention YOLOv5 model and the attention mechanism. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
