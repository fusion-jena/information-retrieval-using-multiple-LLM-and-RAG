Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is an image. The context mentions a 2D convolution operation (Conv2d) and a batch normalization operation (BatchNorm2d), which are commonly used in image processing tasks. Additionally, the input data is referred to as an "input image" with a size of H_in × W_in × c_in, and the output data is referred to as an "output feature map" with a size of H_out × W_out × c_out. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
