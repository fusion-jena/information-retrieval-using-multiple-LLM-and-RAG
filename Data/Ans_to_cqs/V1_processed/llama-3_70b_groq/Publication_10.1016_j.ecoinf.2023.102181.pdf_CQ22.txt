The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. It appears to be discussing a bagging approach for model validation in a spatial context. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are variance explained (ŷve) as a relative measure of performance, and root mean square error (ŷrmse) as an absolute performance metric, in response units. These metrics are used to assess the capacity for unbiased validation using the covariance-weighted bagging approach. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context.
