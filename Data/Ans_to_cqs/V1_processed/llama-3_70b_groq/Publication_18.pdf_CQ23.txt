Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on citing various research papers related to deep learning and its applications, but it does not provide specific information about the dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting used in the model.

However, it can be inferred that the model could be improved by increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea conditions in the training datasets, which might contribute to the generalizability of the model. Additionally, the context mentions the potential to transfer the model to very high spatial resolution images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the automatic identification of specific individuals, which implies that the model might be designed to be adaptable to different scenarios. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is difficult to determine the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.
