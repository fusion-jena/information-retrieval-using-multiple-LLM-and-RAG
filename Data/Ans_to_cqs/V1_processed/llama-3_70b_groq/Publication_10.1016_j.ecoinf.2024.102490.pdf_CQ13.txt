I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, species distribution modeling, and climate change, with mentions of various statistical models and techniques such as Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Generalized Linear Models. There is no mention of deep learning or neural networks, and therefore, it is not possible to determine the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
