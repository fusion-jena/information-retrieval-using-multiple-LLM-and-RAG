The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the single pixel dataset was split into training and testing data using 5 K-fold cross-validations. This implies that the data was split into training and testing sets, but the specific criteria or ratio for this split is not provided.

In general, the common practice in machine learning is to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets, typically in a ratio of 80:10:10 or 70:15:15. However, this information is not provided in the given context.

It's also worth noting that the context does not mention deep learning models, but rather traditional machine learning approaches like Random Forest and MTMI-SMF. Therefore, the criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training is not applicable in this context.
