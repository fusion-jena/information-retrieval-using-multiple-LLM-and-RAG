The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the architectures of the models, such as DenseNet-161, ResNet-50, and Vision Transformers (ViT), and provides details about their layer configurations, hidden sizes, and training times. However, it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
