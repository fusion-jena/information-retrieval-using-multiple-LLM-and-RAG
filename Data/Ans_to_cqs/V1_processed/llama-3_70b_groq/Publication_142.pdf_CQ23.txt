Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the importance of sharing data generated by AI naturalists, following TDWG standards for data interoperability, and including metadata with datasets. It also describes the Pl@ntNet model, its architecture, and its training process, but it does not provide information on how the model's generalizability was ensured.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
