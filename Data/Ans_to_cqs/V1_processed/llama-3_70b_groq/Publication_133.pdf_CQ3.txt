Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to biological problems involving image classification and object detection. It also mentions specific object detection methods such as Faster R-CNN and YOLO, but it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques used.

However, based on the mention of YOLO, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation might be used, as YOLO is an object detection method that uses bounding boxes to locate objects in images. Additionally, the context's focus on image classification and object detection suggests that some form of annotation is necessary to train the deep learning models, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the data annotation techniques used, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation might be used, and other annotation techniques such as instance segmentation might also be employed, but this is not explicitly stated.
