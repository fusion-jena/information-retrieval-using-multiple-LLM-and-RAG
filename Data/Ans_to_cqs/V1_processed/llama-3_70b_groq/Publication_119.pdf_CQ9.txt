I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically U-Net and SVM, for remote sensing applications, and mentions various research papers and publications. However, it does not provide information about the availability of the data repository or the pipeline itself. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
