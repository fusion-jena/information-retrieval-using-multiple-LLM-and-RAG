I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper in ecological informatics, discussing various vegetation indices and their calculation formulas, as well as a brief description of the LightGBM algorithm. There is no mention of a data repository link or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
