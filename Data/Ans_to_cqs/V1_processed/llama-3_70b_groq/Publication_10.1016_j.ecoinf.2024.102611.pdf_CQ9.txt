I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are academic papers and do not include information about data repositories. The tables and text only discuss the methodologies and results of the studies, but do not provide information about where the data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
