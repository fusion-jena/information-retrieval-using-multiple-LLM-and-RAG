The purpose of the deep learning model is age estimation. 

The context does not explicitly state the purpose of the model, but it can be inferred from the information provided. The model is trained on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets, and the authors mention that they are comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of different models. This suggests that the model is being used for a regression task, where the goal is to predict a continuous value (in this case, age). Additionally, the authors mention that VGG-16 has been applied in many researches and is often used to extract features in age estimation tasks, further supporting the conclusion that the purpose of the model is age estimation.
