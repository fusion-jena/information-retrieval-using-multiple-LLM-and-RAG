I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context focuses on the selection of deep learning models, their architectures, and their performance on image classification tasks, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to train these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
