Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the basics of deep neural networks, their applications, and some specific use cases, but it does not delve into the details of data splitting for model training.

However, it is a common practice in machine learning to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. The typical split ratio is 60-70% for training, 15-20% for testing, and 15-20% for validation. The training set is used to train the model, the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance, and the validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters.

But, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data in the context of the provided text.
