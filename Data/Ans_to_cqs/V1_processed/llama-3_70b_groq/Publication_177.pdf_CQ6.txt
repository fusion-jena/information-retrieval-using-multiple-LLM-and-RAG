Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the selection and fine-tuning of network models, Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, and the performance of different models on the datasets. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
