I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model or using a specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be related to a study on land use/land cover, ecology, and environmental data, but it does not provide any information about the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
