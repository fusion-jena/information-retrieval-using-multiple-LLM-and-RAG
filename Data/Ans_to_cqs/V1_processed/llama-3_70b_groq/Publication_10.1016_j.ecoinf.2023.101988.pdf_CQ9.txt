I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of references and citations related to ecological informatics, unmanned aircraft systems, and biodiversity monitoring. However, it does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. The references cited are primarily academic papers and reports, and there is no indication of a publicly available data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
