The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset of herbarium scans from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) with a different set of species and geographical origins, which may contribute to the model's generalizability. Additionally, the model was trained twice, once on a subset of 498 images and then on the full dataset of 653 annotated images, which may help to improve its performance on unseen data. Furthermore, transfer learning was used to initialize the model weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which can also help to improve the model's generalizability. However, without explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
