The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. The context appears to be discussing the use of partial least-squares regression (PLSR) models for estimating soil nutrient concentrations and total nitrogen (TN) from spectral data. The context mentions the use of different models, such as R/PLSR and SG/PLSR, and provides tables showing the importance bands for TN estimation and SOC estimation by PLSR. However, it does not mention the use of deep learning models or any techniques to ensure their generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
