Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The context mentions various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, such as InceptionResNetV2, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, VGG-19, and EfficientNet, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale dataset of images.

There is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary focus of the deep learning pipeline is on image data.

However, it is essential to note that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the entire pipeline, and it is possible that other data formats might be used in other stages of the pipeline.
