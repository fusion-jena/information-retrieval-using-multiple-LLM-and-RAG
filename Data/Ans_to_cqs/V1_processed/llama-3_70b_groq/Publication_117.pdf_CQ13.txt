I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. The text only mentions that a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used, specifically a version of the YOLO DCNN with pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. It does not provide further details on the hyperparameters used to train the model.
