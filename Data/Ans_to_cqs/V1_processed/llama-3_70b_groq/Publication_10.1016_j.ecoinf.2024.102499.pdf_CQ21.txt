Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the data preparation, annotation, and model training process. It discusses the transformation of video clips into still images, annotation of shark and non-shark species, and the exclusion of certain shark species from the testing phase due to infrequent captures. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
