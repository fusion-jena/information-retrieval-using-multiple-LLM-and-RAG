Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses active learning strategies, query selection methods, and the performance of a classification model, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

The context does mention that the classifier achieves 93.2% overall accuracy after the first 30,000 active queries, but it does not specify whether this accuracy threshold is used as a stopping criterion. Additionally, there is no mention of validation loss plateau or any other criteria that might be used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
