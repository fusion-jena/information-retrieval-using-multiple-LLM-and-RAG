I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a discussion about ecological informatics, biodiversity data, and crowdsourcing, with references to various studies and methods for analyzing and mitigating issues with heterogeneous observations. There is no mention of a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
