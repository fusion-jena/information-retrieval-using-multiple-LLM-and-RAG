The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text only mentions a "sound database" with 865 audio samples, which were augmented to generate additional samples. There is no mention of popular image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The focus of the context appears to be on audio classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and mel-spectrogram images, rather than image classification.
