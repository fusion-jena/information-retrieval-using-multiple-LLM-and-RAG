Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the use of transfer learning models, active learning strategies, and embedding spaces for bird species classification. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or k-fold cross-validation. The goal is to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on separate datasets to prevent overfitting and to obtain an unbiased estimate of the model's performance.

In the absence of specific information on data splitting criteria in the provided context, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer.
