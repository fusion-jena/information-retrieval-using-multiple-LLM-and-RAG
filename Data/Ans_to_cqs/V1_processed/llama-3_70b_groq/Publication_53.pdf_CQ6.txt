The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation using the fastai get_transforms function with specific arguments. These arguments include "flip_vert = TRUE" for vertical flipping of images, "max_lighting = 0.02" to limit overly exposing the images, "max_zoom = 1" to disable the zooming augmentation, and "to_fp16 = TRUE" to reduce the memory load on the GPU.

These data augmentation steps can be considered as a form of preprocessing, as they modify the input images to increase the diversity of the training dataset and help the model generalize better. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that data augmentation using the mentioned arguments is involved before training the deep learning model, but we cannot determine if other preprocessing steps are involved.
