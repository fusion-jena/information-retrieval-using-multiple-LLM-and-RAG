I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a study about Xi'an, a city in China, discussing its economic development, geographical location, and data sources. It also includes some mathematical equations related to standard deviation ellipse and azimuth angle, but it does not provide any information about machine learning or model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
