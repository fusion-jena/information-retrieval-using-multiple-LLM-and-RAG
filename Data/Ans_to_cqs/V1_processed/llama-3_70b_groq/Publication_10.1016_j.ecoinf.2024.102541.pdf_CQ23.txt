The context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was evaluated on three different datasets, representing a range of domains, problems, species, and environmental conditions. This suggests that the model was tested on a diverse dataset, which can help improve its generalizability. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the focus of the evaluation was on the model's lightweight, balanced accuracy-speed trade-off, and low computational demands, which implies that the model was designed to be adaptable to different settings. However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these measures were taken.
