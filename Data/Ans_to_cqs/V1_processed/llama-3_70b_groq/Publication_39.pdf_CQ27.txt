Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including the optimization techniques, learning rates, and data augmentation methods used for action recognition and object detection tasks. It does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
