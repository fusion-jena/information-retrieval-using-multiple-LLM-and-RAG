The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the performance of different modeling approaches, including Random Forest (RF), Generalized Linear Models (GLM), and MaxEnt, in the context of species distribution modeling. It discusses the effect of the number of background points used to train the models on their performance, but it does not mention techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context. The query mentions techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but these are not discussed in the provided context.
