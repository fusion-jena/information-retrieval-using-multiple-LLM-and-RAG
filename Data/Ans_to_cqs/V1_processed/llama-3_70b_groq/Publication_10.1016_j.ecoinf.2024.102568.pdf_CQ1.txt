Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions "air quality sensors" and "legal stations" that collect measurements of pollutants, air temperature, and humidity. These measurements are then used as input data for the LSTM algorithm. There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data. Therefore, it can be inferred that sensors are the primary method used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.
