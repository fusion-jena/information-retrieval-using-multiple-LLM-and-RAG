I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the Peruvian Amazon forestry dataset, the performance of different deep learning models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) on the dataset, and the interpretability of the models. It also mentions some related work in plant species classification and disease detection, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
