I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions the tools and libraries used for building and training the model, such as Python, Theano, Lasagne, and Librosa, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
