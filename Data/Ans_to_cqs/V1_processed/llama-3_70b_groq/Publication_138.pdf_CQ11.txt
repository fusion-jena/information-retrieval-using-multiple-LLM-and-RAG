I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper discussing various deep learning models such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and others, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
