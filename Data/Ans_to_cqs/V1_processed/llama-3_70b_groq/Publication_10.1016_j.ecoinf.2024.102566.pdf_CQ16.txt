I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to forest inventory data, biomass estimation, and climate change, but it does not mention training or validation loss plateau, which are terms commonly used in machine learning. The context cites several research papers and provides data on forest biomass and carbon storage, but it does not provide any information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

The only paper that seems to be related to remote sensing and data analysis is the one by Bortolot and Wynne (2005), which discusses an individual tree-based approach to estimating forest biomass using small footprint LiDAR data. However, it does not mention anything about training completion criteria.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
