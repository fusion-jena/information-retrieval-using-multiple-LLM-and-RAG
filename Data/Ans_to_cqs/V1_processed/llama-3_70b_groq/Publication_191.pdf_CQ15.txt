Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the application of deep CNN networks for plant species identification, discussing the importance of large datasets and the analysis of feature visualizations. It also mentions the increase in depth of CNN models to achieve state-of-the-art results, but it does not specify the optimization techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
