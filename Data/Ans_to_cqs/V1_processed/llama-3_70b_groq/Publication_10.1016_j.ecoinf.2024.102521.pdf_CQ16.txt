Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the STARdbi system, its capabilities, and the process of training and storing models using the site's interface and computational resources. It also discusses the performance of a task-specific classifier and the availability of programs for generating classification models. However, it does not provide specific information on the training completion criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given context.
