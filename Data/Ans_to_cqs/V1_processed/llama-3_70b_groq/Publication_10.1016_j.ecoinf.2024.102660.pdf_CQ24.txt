The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The text focuses on the development and evaluation of a deep learning model (Res_AUNet) for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. It discusses the model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation, but does not provide information on handling randomness.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
