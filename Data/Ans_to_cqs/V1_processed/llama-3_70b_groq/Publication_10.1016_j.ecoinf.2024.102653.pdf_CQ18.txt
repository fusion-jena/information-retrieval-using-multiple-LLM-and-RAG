The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was monitored through the use of conventional metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's weights were randomly initialized using a specific integer seed to guarantee consistent reproducibility of results, and meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted to achieve optimal model performance. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored and evaluated during the hyperparameter tuning process.

Furthermore, the context provides a figure (Fig. 4) that shows the accuracy of the training and validation datasets, which implies that the model's performance was monitored and evaluated during training using accuracy as a metric. However, the specific strategy or approach used to monitor the model's performance during training is not explicitly stated.
