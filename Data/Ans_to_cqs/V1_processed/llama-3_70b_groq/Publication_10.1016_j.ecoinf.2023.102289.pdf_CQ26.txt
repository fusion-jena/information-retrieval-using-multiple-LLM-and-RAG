I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the LaDeco platform, its functionality, and its components, such as the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, threshold setting, and output format. It also discusses the computational efficiency and the programming platform used. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
