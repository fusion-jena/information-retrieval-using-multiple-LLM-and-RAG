The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only mentions the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. There is no mention of deep learning models or their associated frameworks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
