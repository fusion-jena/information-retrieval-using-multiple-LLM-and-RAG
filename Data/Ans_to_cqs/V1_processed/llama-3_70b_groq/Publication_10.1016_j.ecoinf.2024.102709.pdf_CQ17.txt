The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the YOLOv8n model's performance on number classification tasks, discussing issues like overfitting when trained on MNIST data and the use of preprocessing techniques to enhance image recognition.

However, it does not provide information on specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization that are commonly used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
