I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on a specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context primarily discusses Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-based platform for high-performance computing, particularly in the context of wildfire science. It highlights the capabilities of GEE for processing large-scale remote sensing data and its applicability in machine learning algorithms. However, it does not provide information about the deployment of a deep learning model on a specific platform.
