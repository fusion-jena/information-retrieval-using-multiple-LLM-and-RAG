The provided context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning pipeline datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and remote sensing, and the datasets mentioned are primarily focused on environmental and geographical data.

The datasets mentioned in the context include:

* MOD13Q1.006 (NDVI data)
* SRTM V4.1 (DEM data)
* Vegetation type data (reclassified into nine categories)
* Meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, and radiation) from CMIP6
* Road data
* GDP data
* Population data

These datasets are used for analyzing and predicting NDVI values, but they are not related to deep learning pipeline datasets.
