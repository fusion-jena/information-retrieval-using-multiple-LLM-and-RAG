I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning for Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for different datasets. It discusses the selection of hyperparameters, such as learning rate, tree depth, and number of iterations, but does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
