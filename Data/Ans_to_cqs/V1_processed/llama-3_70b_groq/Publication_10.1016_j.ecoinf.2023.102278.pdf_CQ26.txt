The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the architecture and training of the model, including the use of transfer learning, dropout regularization, and the Adam optimizer. It also discusses the importance of large training datasets for robust predictions and the challenges of unbalanced datasets in entomological applications.

However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
