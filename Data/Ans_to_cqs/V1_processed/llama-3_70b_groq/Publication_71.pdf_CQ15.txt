The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The table of training parameters for DeepLabV3+ (Table 1) lists the learning policy as "Poly", which suggests that a polynomial learning rate schedule is used, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm. Therefore, I don't know the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
