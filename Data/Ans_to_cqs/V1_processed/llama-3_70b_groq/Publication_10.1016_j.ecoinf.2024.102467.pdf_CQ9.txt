I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is available. The "Data availability" section only mentions that the data generated or analyzed in the study are available from the corresponding author (J. X.) upon reasonable request, but it does not provide information about a public data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
