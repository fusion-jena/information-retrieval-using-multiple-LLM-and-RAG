The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is clustering, specifically unsupervised clustering using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) networks. The model is used for regional zoning and to study the mechanisms that drive regional differentiation. It aims to analyze and process a large amount of complex data to reveal the driving mechanisms of regional differentiation.
