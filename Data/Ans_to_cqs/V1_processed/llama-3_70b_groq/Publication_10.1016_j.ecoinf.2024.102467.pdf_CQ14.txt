I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a collection of references to various papers and articles on topics such as machine learning, computer vision, and aquaculture, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization method used for hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
