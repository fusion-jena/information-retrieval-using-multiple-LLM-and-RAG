I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically the YOLOv5 family, for detecting alates on sorghum leaves, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
