I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. It discusses various research studies and tools used for land use and land cover analysis, forest fire monitoring, and carbon emissions quantification, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository. The context mentions the use of Python APIs, Google Drive, and Google Earth Engine, but it does not provide a link or mention a specific repository where the code is available. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
