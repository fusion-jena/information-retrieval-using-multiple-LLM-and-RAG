I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, ecology, and conservation, with a list of land cover classes and references to academic papers on topics such as habitat suitability models and wild rabbit conservation. There is no mention of deep learning or related concepts. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
