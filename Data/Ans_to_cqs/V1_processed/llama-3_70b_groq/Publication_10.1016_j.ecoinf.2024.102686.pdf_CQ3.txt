I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to geospatial data and its processing, including data sources, preprocessing steps, and a zoning index system. It does not provide information about deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
