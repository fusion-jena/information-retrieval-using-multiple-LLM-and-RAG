The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the experiment descriptions, it can be inferred that the raw data consists of images, possibly of plants or leaves, used for plant identification.

The context mentions "dataset D" and "leaf-scans," suggesting that the data might be collected through some form of image capture, such as photography or scanning. However, the exact method of data collection is not specified.

It is also possible that the dataset is sourced from existing public datasets, as the context references the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition and the Imagenet classification task, which are both related to computer vision and image datasets.

In summary, while the exact method of data collection is not specified, it can be inferred that the raw data consists of images, possibly collected through photography or scanning, and may be sourced from public datasets.
