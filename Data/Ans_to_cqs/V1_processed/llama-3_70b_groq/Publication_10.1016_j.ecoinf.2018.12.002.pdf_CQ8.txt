I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a research article or paper on machine learning for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data. It includes references to various research papers, books, and journals, but it does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I am unable to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
