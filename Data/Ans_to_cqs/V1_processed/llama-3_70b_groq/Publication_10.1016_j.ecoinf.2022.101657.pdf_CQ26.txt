The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for species identification in camera trap images, discussing the potential benefits of bespoke neural networks and low-power neural networks in hardware. It also mentions the use of transfer learning and evaluation metrics such as mean average precision (mAP). However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
