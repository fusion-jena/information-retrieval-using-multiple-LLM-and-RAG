The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that the authors "structed the deep learning models in R using H2O" and that they compared the predictions obtained from deep learning models with other methods such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and a Na√Øve Bayes classifier. Therefore, I don't know the specific type of deep learning model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer).
