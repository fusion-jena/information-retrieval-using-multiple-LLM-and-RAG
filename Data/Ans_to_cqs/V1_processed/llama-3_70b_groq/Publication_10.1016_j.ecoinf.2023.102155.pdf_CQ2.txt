I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. The context appears to be discussing intensity maps, performance measures, and methods such as knn, LoopT, and CoinF, but it does not provide any information about the data formats used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
