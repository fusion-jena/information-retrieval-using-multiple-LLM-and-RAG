Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Adjusted R2, MSE, AIC, and BIC. These metrics are mentioned in Table 1, which presents the performance evaluation of the AGBpred prediction models developed on linear, power, exponential, and artificial neural network (ANN) based regression methods. 

Adjusted R2 is the adjusted coefficient of determination, MSE is the mean squared error, AIC is the Akaike Information Criterion, and BIC is the Bayesian Information Criterion. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models in terms of their predictive power and goodness of fit. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does not mention traditional deep learning metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models. The models presented in the context appear to be regression models, and therefore, the evaluation metrics are focused on measuring the goodness of fit and predictive power of the models rather than their classification accuracy.
