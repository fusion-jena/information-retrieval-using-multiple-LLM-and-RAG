Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with remote sensing (RS) data, which is typically in the form of images. Specifically, the text mentions the use of Sentinel-2 time series data, hyperspectral data, and high-resolution remote sensing imagery. These data formats are likely to be in the form of raster images or multi-band images.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not typically used to store image data, so it is unlikely that CSV is a primary data format used in this pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the primary data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely to be image formats, such as raster images or multi-band images, derived from remote sensing data.
