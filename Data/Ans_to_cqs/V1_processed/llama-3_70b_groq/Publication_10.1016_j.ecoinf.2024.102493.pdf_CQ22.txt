I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any metrics used to evaluate its performance. The context appears to be related to a geographical detector method for analyzing the explanatory power of driver factors on the spatial variability of a vegetation index (kNDVI). The metrics mentioned in the context, such as Q values, slope, and p-values, are used to evaluate the relationships between the driver factors and the kNDVI, but they are not related to the performance of a deep learning model.
