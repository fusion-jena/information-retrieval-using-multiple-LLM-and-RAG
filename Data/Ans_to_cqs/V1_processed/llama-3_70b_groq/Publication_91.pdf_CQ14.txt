The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the batch size, initial learning rate, and the exponential decay of the learning rate, but it does not provide information on the optimization method used to find these hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
