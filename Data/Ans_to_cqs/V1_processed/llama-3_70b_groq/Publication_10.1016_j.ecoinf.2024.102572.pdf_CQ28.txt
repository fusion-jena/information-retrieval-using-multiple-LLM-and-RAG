The context does not explicitly mention the deployment platform of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a "cloud platform" in the context of incorporating high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite photos (Bar et al., 2019) and the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for analyzing large amounts of satellite data. While GEE is a platform, it is not a deployment platform for deep learning models in the classical sense (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
