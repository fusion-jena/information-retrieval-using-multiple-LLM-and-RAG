Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the training process of the YOLOv5 model, including the loss function, validation data, and number of epochs. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
