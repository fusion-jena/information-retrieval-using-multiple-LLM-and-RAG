I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where it can be found. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of a WT-HMM (Wavelet-Transform Hidden Markov Model) for detecting North Atlantic Right Whale Up-Calls, and it references several other studies and papers, but it does not provide any information about a code repository. Therefore, I am unable to determine where the code repository is available.
