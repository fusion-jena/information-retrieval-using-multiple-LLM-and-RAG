I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sound classification, the representation of sound data, and the fine-tuning of CNN models, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
