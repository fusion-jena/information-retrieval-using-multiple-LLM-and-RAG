The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to track the validation loss. The learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation set was monitored during training, and the learning rate was adjusted accordingly to prevent overfitting and improve convergence.
