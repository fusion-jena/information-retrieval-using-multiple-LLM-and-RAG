I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to functional data analysis (FDA) and its application in marine ecological studies. It discusses the use of statistical methods for functional data, reviews of FDA concepts and advances, and the analysis of relationships between spatial structuration and the pelagic environment. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
