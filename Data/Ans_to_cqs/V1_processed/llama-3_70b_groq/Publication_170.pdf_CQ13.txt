Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context focuses on the model architecture, experimental setup, and performance comparison on different computing platforms. It provides details about the model architecture, including the number of convolutional and fully connected layers, activation functions, and downsampling methods. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
