The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, F-Score, and loss. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in distinguishing between different water quality conditions. The accuracy rates of the model on the public and real-time datasets are 98.69% and 99.89%, respectively. The precision and recall rates are also high, with precision rates of 98.5% on the public dataset and 99.26% on the real-time dataset, and recall rates of 97.33% on the public dataset and 99.62% on the real-time dataset. The F-Score is also reported, with values ranging from 93.49 to 99.29. The loss metric is used to measure the difference between the predicted and true labels, with lower values indicating better performance.
