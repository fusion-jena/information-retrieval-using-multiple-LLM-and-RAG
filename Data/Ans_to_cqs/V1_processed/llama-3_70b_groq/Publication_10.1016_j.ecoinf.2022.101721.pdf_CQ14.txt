I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the importance of including all observations in statistical modeling, the limitations of current software for automated bat ID, and the potential benefits of using Bayesian algorithms with user interaction. It also mentions the importance of considering local conditions in species identification, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
