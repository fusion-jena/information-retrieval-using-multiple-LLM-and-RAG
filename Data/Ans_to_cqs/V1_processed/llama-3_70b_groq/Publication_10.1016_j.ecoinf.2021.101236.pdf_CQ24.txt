Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the BirdNET algorithm, its application in avian diversity monitoring, and the overall process of developing a deep learning system for bird species classification. It mentions following current best practices in deep learning, as summarized in Chollet (2017), but does not provide specific details on handling randomness. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
