I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on random forest classification, a machine learning method, and its application to mapping coastal and seagrass habitats. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
