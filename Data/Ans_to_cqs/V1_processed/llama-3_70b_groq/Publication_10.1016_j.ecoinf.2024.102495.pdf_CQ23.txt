To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors employed stratified 10-fold cross-validation. This is mentioned in the text as "The model generated in the training process was evaluated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation with calculated values of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, area under the curve (AUC) score, confusion matrix, and model training time for binary and multiclass classifications." This technique helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is robust to different subsets of the data. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting.
