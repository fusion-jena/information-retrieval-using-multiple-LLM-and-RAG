I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or random seed values. It appears to be discussing a clustering approach to determine the number of freshness classes for fish species, using a dataset of fish freshness inspection data. The context explains the methodology used to identify the number of clusters and their duration, but it does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
