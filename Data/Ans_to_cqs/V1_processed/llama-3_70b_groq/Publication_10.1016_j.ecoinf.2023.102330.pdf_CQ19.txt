I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, bird species detection, and conservation, but it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build deep learning models. The papers and references mentioned are related to the application of deep learning in ecology, but they do not provide details about the implementation or the frameworks used. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
