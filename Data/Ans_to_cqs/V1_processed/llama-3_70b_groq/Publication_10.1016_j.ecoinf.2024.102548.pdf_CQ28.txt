I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the proposed architecture of the MobileNet and GRU model, its performance, and its application in okra cultivation, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
