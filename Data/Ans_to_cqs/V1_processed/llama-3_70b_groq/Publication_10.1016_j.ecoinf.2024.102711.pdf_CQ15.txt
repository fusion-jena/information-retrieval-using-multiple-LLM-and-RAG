The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but it does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in deep learning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention hyperparameter tuning, which is a crucial aspect of deep learning model optimization. The context mentions that optimal hyperparameter selection leads to improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance. It also discusses the use of k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning in AutoGluon.

While the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it suggests that hyperparameter tuning is an important aspect of the deep learning pipeline. However, the specific optimization techniques used, such as SGD or Adam, are not mentioned.
