The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is explicitly mentioned in the context, specifically in the section 2.2.1. CNN structure, which describes the architecture of a CNN and its application to image classification. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a CNN in the DialectDecoder pipeline, as shown in Fig. 1, where the program trains the CNN and k-NN to classify unknown songs.
