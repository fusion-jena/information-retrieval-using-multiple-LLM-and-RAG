The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the algorithm used is a deep neural network algorithm, and the Python TensorFlow library is used to implement it. This suggests that the model is likely a type of feedforward neural network, but the specific architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) is not specified.
