Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the data collection, dataset splitting, and the Random Forest classifier specifications. It also discusses the evaluation objectives and the potential for future improvements. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
