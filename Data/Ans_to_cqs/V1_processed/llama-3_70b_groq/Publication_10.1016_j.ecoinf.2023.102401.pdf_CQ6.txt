The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some preprocessing steps in the context of data collection and preparation for underwater target detection models.

In Step 1, it is mentioned that pre-processing of the acquired data includes denoising, image enhancement, and correction. Additionally, the dataset needs to be labeled, and the underwater images are separated into training and test images.

It does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are common preprocessing steps in deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
