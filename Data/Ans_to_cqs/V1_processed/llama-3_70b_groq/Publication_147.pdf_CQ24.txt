The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and XGBoost algorithms for wetland mapping using remote sensing data. It discusses the study area, data inputs, and results of the comparison, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
