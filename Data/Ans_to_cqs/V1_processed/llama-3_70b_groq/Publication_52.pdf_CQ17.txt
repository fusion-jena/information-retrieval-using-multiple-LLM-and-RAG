The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM)" and "Regularized Autoencoder" which suggest that regularization techniques are used, but the specific methods (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization) are not mentioned. 

It is worth noting that the context focuses more on the application of Deep Learning algorithms, particularly Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and Deep Extreme Learning (DELE), in object recognition and image classification tasks. It highlights the advantages of ELMs in handling Big Data and their potential to generalize, but it does not delve into the details of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.
