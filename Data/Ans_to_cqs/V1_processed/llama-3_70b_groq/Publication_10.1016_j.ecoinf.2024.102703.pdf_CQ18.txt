The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to set a maximum training error of 0.001 and to stop training when this error is reached or when the maximum number of training times (10,000) is reached. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI values.
