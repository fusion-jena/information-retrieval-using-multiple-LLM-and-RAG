The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using GridSearchCV with cross-validation. This involves a systematic search across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values, with each candidate combination assessed using tenfold cross-validation. This process ensures that the eventual choice of hyperparameters is not arbitrary but is backed by empirical evidence.
