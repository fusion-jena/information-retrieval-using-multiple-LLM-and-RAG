Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training process of the noise reduction network for bird sound denoising. It explains the loss function, feature activation, and the experimental setting, but it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not mention saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, which are common postprocessing steps in machine learning. To determine the postprocessing steps involved, additional information or context would be required.
