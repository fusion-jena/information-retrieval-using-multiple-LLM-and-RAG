The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the training dataset. The context mentions that the training images were randomly cropped to 256 Ã— 256 resolution and augmented, which suggests that the model was trained on a varied set of images. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset. The context only mentions that the training images were generated randomly on the fly from source images presented in Table 1, but it does not provide further details about the dataset or the splitting strategy used. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the model's generalizability was ensured through these specific measures.
