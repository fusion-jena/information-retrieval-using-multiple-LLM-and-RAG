I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the application of deep learning models in various ecological and environmental studies, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The context mentions the use of XGBoost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and SPOT satellite equipment, but it does not specify the cloud platform or infrastructure used to deploy the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
