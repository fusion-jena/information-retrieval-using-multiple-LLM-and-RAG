Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically WV-3 imagery. This is mentioned in the text as "raw WV-3 imagery input alone is able to produce >90% accuracies". There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV being used in the pipeline. The context focuses on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks using the U-Net model, which is a type of convolutional neural network commonly used for image processing tasks.
