Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, model performance, and training results, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. It is possible that the original text or research paper may have discussed data bias and preprocessing techniques, but that information is not present in the given context.
