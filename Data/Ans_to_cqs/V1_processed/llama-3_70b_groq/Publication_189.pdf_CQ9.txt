I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects of the system, such as the compatible TensorFlow and Keras versions, the backbone structures used, the anchor boxes, and the training process. It also mentions data collection and annotation, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
