The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that "modeling package options enable automated tuning for parameters through resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final model configuration." This suggests that the hyperparameters may be optimized through some form of automated tuning, possibly involving resampling, but the specific method (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
