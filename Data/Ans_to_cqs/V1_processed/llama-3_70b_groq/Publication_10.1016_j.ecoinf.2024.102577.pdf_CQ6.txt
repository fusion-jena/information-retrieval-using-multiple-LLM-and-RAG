Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research article on machine learning in sustainable fisheries, and it provides information on the models used, their performance, and references to other research papers. However, it does not provide specific details on the preprocessing steps.

In general, common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. Normalization involves scaling numerical features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming features to a common scale, such as standardization or min-max scaling. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming raw features into more meaningful and relevant features for the model.

However, without specific information on the preprocessing steps used in this particular research, it is impossible to provide a more detailed answer.
