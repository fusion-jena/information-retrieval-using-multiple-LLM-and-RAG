The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the importance of high-quality annotated data for deep learning models, fieldwork expeditions to collect and validate data, and an observer study to analyze the performance of human experts in identifying sub-alpine shrub species.

However, it can be inferred that the authors have employed some strategies to handle randomness, such as random sampling of patches to mimic species distributions in the testing of DL networks. This is mentioned in the observer study section, where a set of 457 patches was randomly displayed to the observers to reduce the impact of fatigue and subsequent misclassifications.

But, the context does not provide specific information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
