According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the random forest model are optimized using Bayesian Optimization. This is mentioned in Section 2.7, which states that "hyperparameter optimization was performed using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development". There is no mention of grid search or random search being used for hyperparameter optimization.
