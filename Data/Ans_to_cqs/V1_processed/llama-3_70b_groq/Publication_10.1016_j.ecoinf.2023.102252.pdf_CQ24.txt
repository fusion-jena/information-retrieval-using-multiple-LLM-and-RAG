I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, random seed values, or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, environmental flow, and riparian ecosystems, and discusses the calibration of a model called FERM using the Shuffle Complex Evolution method to fit parameters and maximize the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
