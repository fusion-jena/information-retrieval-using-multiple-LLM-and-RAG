Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, including the choice of deep learning architecture, training mechanism, dataset type, and training-testing set distribution. It also provides information about the hyperparameters used for training, such as momentum, weight decay, gamma, and batch size. However, it does not discuss how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
