I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. The context discusses various deep learning architectures, including RNNs, LSTM, and GRU, and their applications in time-series prediction and air pollution analysis. However, it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
