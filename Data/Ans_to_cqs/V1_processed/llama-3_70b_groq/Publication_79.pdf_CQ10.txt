I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions some GitHub links, but they are not related to the deep learning pipeline of this specific work. For example, reference 28 mentions a GitHub link for a Deep U-net for satellite image segmentation, but it is not the code repository link for the pipeline used in this work.
