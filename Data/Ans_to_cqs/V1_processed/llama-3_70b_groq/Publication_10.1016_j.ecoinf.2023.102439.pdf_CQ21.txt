The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that "several statistical metrics were employed" to evaluate the performance of the model, including the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation between the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values.

There is no mention of saliency maps, confusion matrix, or other postprocessing steps. Therefore, it can be concluded that the context does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
