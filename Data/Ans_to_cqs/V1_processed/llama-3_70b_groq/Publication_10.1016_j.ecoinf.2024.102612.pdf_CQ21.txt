The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that after the model is trained, a few samples of real MS point clouds are segmented using the methodology exposed in Section 2.3 to create a ground truth. This ground truth is then used to validate the classifications using the trained DL model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the inferences on real MS point clouds are taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme presented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved. The final fuel model classifications are summarized in Table 3.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include creating a ground truth using real MS point clouds, validating the classifications using the trained model, and using the inferences as inputs for the decision tree scheme to retrieve the final fuel models. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.
