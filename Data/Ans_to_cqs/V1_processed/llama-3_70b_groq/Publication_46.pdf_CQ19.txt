The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only discusses the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and its application to species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information about the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
