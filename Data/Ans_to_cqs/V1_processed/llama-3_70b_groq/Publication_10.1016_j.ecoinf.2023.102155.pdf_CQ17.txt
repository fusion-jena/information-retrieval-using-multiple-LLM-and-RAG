The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used in deep learning, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does discuss regularization methods in the context of regression techniques, specifically lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net regression. These methods impose a penalty on parameter coefficients to prevent them from growing too large, which can help prevent overfitting. 

It is worth noting that the context does not mention dropout, which is a specific regularization technique commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization is mentioned indirectly, as ridge regression is a type of L2 regularization. However, the context does not explicitly discuss these methods in the context of deep learning.
