I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. The context includes various papers and articles related to machine learning, remote sensing, and land use classification, but it does not provide information about a specific pipeline or deep learning model used in it. The papers mention techniques such as random Forest, hyperspectral remote sensing, and texture feature extraction, but they do not specify a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
