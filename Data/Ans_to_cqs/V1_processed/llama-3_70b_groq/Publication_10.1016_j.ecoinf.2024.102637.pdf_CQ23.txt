Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the design and optimization of the AlexNet model and its variants, as well as the importance of model depth and complexity. It discusses the trade-off between model performance and computational efficiency, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
