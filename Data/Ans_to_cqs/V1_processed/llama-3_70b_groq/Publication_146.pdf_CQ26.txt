Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model training, optimization, and hyperparameter settings, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the creation of a custom dataset due to the lack of existing quality data. This might imply that the authors have taken some steps to ensure the quality and diversity of their dataset, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.
