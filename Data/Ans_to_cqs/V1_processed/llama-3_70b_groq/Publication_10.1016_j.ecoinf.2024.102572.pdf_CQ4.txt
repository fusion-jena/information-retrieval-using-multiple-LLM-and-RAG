I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on using machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments and quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires, as well as working with satellite images and geospatial data on cloud platforms. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of training datasets.
