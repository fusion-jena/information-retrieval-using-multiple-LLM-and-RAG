The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model development and validation process, including the selection of Sentinel-2 bands, linear regression modeling, and model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, R2, MAE, and bias.

However, it can be inferred that some form of model validation was performed, as the context mentions the use of a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach to evaluate the model's performance. This suggests that the model's performance was assessed using a subset of the data, but the specific postprocessing steps involved are not detailed.

There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these specific postprocessing steps were involved in the model development process.

In summary, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training.
