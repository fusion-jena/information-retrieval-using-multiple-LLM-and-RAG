The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data collection process, data preprocessing steps, and the application of transfer learning using YAMNet for goat vocalization detection. 

However, it can be inferred that the dataset is divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes, which might help in reducing overfitting and ensuring that the model generalizes well. Additionally, the use of a sliding window with an overlap of 50% during preprocessing might help in capturing important information existing on the edges of the window. 

But, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used in this specific pipeline.
