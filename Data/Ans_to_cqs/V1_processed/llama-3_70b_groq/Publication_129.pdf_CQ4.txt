Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the Faster R-CNN approach, Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer, and the performance comparison of different methods on the IP102 dataset. It does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
