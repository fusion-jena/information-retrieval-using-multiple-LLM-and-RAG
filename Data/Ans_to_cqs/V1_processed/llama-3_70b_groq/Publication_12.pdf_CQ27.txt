Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and testing of the Waveman model using BatNet and its optimization. It discusses the training process, including the batch size, learning rate, and the use of a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) for training. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
