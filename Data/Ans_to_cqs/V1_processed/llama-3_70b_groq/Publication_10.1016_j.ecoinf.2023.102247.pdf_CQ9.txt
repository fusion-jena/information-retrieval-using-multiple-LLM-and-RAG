I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses a study on predicting the distribution of a species using an ensemble modeling approach in BIOMOD2 package in R, and it mentions the use of climate scenarios and habitat variables. However, it does not provide information about a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
