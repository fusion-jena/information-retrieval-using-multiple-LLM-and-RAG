I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that introducing the hybrid model (combining CNN and LSTM) improves the model's prediction accuracy without any adjustments to the hyperparameters. It also mentions that the structure and hyperparameters of the model are stabilized, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
