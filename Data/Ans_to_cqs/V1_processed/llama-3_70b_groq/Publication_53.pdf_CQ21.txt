Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Classification of unlabelled images: The trained model was used to automate the classification of 500 more images from the unlabelled training dataset.

2. Manual correction of mistakes: The authors manually fixed any mistakes in the classification results.

3. Iterative training and classification: The process of training, classification, and manual correction was repeated until all 7362 downloaded images were labelled.

4. Confusion matrix calculation: A confusion matrix for farm dam detection with the deep learning CNN was generated, as shown in Figure S1 of the supplementary materials.

No mention is made of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps beyond these.
