The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and specific architectures such as Xception and MobileNetV2, but does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was used.
