Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs). These devices are used to record acoustic data, which is then analyzed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect and identify species of interest, such as the bobwhite.

Additionally, the context mentions that the CNN model was trained on covey call spectrogram data collected separately from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and Alabama, USA. This suggests that the raw data may also be collected through field recordings, which are then used to train and validate the CNN model.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that human observer point counts may be used as an alternative or complementary method for collecting data, as mentioned in the context.
