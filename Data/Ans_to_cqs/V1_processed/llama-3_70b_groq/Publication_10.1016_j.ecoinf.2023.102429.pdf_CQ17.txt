Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, soil science, and spectroscopy, with mentions of techniques like PLSR, random forest, and convolutional neural networks. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
