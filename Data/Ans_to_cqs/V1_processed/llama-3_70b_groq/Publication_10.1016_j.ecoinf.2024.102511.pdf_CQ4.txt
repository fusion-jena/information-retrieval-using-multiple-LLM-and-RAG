Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context mentions data augmentation in general, citing a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019), but it does not provide details on specific techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context discusses the application of machine learning and deep neural networks in bioacoustic classification, particularly in the context of marine mammals. It mentions the importance of large datasets and the need for significant sample sizes for all classes. It also references various studies that have used deep neural networks for bioacoustic classification, but again, it does not provide specific information on data augmentation techniques.

In summary, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to answer the query about specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline.
