I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a report discussing the performance of various deep learning models on plant disease classification tasks, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
