Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as the creation of a confusion matrix. This is evident from Fig. 4, which shows an accuracy comparison of different pixels and the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score of the final selected 21 pixels, along with a confusion matrix of 21 pixels.

There is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. It is possible that other postprocessing steps may have been performed, but they are not mentioned in the provided text.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include metrics calculation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) and creation of a confusion matrix.
