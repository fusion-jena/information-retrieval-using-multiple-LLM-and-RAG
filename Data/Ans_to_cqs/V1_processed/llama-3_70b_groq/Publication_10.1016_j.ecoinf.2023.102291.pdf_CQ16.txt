Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete are based on the best validation accuracy (proportion of all correct predictions) and precision (number of true positives divided by true positives and false positives) obtained during training. The most suitable architecture was chosen based on these criteria. However, it does not explicitly mention validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete.
