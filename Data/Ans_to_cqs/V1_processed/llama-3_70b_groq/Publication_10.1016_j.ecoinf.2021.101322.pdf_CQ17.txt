Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of transfer learning, EfficientNet, and the performance metrics of the CNN models, but it does not provide information about regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
