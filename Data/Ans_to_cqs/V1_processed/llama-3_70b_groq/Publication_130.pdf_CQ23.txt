The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does provide some information that can be related to generalizability.

For instance, the context mentions that photographing animals across different times of the day and in different lighting conditions can help capture a broad range of contexts, which can contribute to the model's generalizability. Additionally, the use of a large dataset with over 14 million images (ImageNet dataset) for pre-training the model can also help improve its generalizability.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the model was trained on a dataset with a large number of images (at least 1,600 images per bird species) and that the model was re-trained with updated data to address the issue of new individuals arriving in the study population. This continuous updating of the model with new data can also help improve its generalizability.

However, it is not clear if other measures such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation were used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these specific measures were taken.
