The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the dataset, data augmentation, and training parameters, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
