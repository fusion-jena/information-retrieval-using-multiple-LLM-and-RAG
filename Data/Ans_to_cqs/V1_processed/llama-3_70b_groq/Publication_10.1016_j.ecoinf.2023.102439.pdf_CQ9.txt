I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to a study involving Land Surface Temperature (LST) retrieval, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and other environmental and ecological topics. It cites various research papers and datasets, but does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository where it is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
