The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that several models were trained on the insect TL (TLm) benchmark dataset to optimize the hyper-parameter α, and that α = 0.5 was chosen for the study. It also mentions the use of the Adam optimizer with a fixed learning rate of 1.0⋅10^(-6), but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were searched or optimized.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
