The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that annotations were made using the polygon tool in the labeling section of the cloud-based Roboflow environment (Fig. 1B). This suggests that polygon annotation or instance segmentation might be used, but it is not explicitly stated.

It is also possible that other annotation techniques, such as bounding box annotation, might be used, but there is no direct evidence in the provided context to support this. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.
