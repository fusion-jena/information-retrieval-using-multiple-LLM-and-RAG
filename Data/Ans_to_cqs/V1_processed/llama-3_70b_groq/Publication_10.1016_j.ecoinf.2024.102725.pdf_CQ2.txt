Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) images. The context mentions the fusion of optical and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, which suggests that the input data consists of remote sensing images. Additionally, the evaluation metrics mentioned, such as RMSE and R2, are commonly used to assess the accuracy of image-based models. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
