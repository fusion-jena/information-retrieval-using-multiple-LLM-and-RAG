Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on species selection, environmental data, and the architecture of a CNN model for species distribution modeling.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention random selection of species in the process of creating the datasets E1000, E200, and E50. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the data selection process, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
