Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and components of a deep learning model, including the SPPF module, neck network, feature pyramid network (FPN), and path aggregation network (PAN), as well as the attention mechanism and convolution operations. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
