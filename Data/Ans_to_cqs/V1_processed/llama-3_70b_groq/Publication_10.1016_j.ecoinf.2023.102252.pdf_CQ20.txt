I don't know. The provided context does not mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on environmental flow, riparian ecosystem, and wetland biodiversity maintenance, and it discusses model parameters, data, and computational requirements, but it does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the model.
