I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article discussing the improvement of deep learning-based bluespotted ribbontail ray recognition, but it does not provide information about the data repository used. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
