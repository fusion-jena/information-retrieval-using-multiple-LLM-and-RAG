I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to focus on drought characteristics, groundwater-climate interactions, and data categories, but it does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
