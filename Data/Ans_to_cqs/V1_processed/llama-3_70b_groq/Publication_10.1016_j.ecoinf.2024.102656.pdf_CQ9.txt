I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The text appears to be discussing a research study on habitat suitability and connectivity for ungulates in central Iran, using tools such as UNICOR and least-cost path analysis. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository, nor is there any information about where the data might be stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
