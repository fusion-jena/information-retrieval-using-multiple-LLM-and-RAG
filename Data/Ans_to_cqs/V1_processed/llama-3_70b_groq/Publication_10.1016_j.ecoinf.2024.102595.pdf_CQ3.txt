I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the importance of predicting oil palm crop yields, the use of machine learning and deep learning models for yield prediction, and the methodology used for model training and testing, including data preprocessing, model construction, and hyper-parameter tuning. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
