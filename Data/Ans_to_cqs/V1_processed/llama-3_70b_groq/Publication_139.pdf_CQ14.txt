The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the optimizer Adam was selected with an initial learning rate of (cid:0) 7 and early stopping was used to prevent overfitting. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters were optimized based on the provided context.
