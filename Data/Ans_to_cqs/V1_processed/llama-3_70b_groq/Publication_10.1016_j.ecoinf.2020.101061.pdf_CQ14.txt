Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the performance of the model in different scenarios, such as within-site, cross-site, and transfer-learning, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It is possible that the authors used a specific method for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
