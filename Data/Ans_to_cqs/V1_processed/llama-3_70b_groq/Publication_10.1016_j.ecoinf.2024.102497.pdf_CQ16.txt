The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the implementation of CART and Random Forest regression models for nearshore bathymetry, including the selection of optimal model parameters. It does not provide information on the stopping conditions or criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
