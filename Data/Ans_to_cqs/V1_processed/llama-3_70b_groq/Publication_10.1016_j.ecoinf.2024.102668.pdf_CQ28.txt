I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The text only mentions the potential extension of ecoacoustic indices to fields like machine learning and deep learning, but it does not provide information about the actual deployment of a model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
