Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on few-shot learning, its applications, and comparisons with classic deep learning approaches. It discusses data augmentation as a way to address the problem of limited data, but it does not elaborate on specific annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
