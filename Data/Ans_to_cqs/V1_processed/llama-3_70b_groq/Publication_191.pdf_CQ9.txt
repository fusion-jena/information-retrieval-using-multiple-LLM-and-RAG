I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored. It discusses the use of CNN for plant species identification, the importance of large datasets, and the analysis of feature visualizations in CNN. However, it does not provide information about the data repository used to store the data. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
