Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the proposed CNN-LSTM model, experimental setup, and performance evaluation. It does not provide information on data splitting or preprocessing for training, testing, and validation purposes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
