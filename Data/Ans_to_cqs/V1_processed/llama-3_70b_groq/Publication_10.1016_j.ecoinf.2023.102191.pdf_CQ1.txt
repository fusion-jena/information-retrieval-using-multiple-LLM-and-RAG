Based on the provided context, it appears that the method utilized for collecting raw data is through a mobile app that conducts post-dive interviews with recreational SCUBA divers. The app uses a custom species list to collect data on the frequency and abundance of specific marine taxa. Additionally, the app collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers, enabling normalization based on "sampling effort". There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in this specific study.
