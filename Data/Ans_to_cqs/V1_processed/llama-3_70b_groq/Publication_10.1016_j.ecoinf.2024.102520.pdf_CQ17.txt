I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be related to land use, soil science, and ecology, discussing topics such as land use maps, soil maps, and spatial datasets. It also mentions kriging methods and diagnostic measures of quality for spatial prediction. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, so I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
