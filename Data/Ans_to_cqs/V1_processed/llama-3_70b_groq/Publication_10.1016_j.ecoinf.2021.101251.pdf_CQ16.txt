I don't know.

The provided context does not mention training or validation loss plateau, which are terms commonly used in machine learning. The context appears to be related to scientific research, data management, and citation practices, but it does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
