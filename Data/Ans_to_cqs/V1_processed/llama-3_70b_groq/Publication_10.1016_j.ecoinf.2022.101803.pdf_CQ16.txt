Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is the median of k-1 out-of-sample R2's for each number of iterations. This is mentioned in the context as "Calculate the median of k-1 out-of-sample R2's for each number of iterations to pick the best number of iterations." 

There is no mention of validation loss plateau as a criteria to determine when training is complete. The context focuses on calculating the out-of-sample R2 and taking the median of k-1 folds to select the best number of iterations.
