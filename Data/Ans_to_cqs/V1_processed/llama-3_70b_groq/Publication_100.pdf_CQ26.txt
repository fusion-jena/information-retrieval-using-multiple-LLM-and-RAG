The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, implementation details, and experimental results. It discusses the model's performance and biases in estimating certain variables, but it does not provide information on how data bias was addressed during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. It is possible that the authors may have used certain techniques to address data bias, but this information is not mentioned in the given text.
