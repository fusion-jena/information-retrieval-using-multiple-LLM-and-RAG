I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the management and storage of fish-related data, including metadata and imaging samples, rather than deep learning or computer vision techniques. It discusses the importance of controlled vocabularies, data quality, and FAIR data principles, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
