Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses various machine learning loss functions and their performance on different datasets, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria for determining when training is complete.

In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include validation loss plateau, validation accuracy plateau, convergence of model parameters, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete based on the provided context.
