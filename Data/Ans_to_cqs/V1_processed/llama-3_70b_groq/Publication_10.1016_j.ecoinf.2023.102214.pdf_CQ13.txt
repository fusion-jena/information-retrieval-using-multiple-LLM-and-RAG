Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs and inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. It does not provide further details on the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
