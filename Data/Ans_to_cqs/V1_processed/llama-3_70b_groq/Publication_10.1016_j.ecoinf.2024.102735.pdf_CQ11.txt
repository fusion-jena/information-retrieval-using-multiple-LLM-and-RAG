I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The acknowledgement section mentions that "Data will be available on request and upon approval from Greenville County Land Development Division", but it does not provide a direct link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
