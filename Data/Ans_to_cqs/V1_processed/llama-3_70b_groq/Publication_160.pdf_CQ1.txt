Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep neural networks, particularly CNNs, for identifying coralligenous species and assessing biodiversity and ecological status of coralligenous reefs. It discusses the use of annotated photographic quadrats as a dataset, but it does not provide information on how these quadrats were collected.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the raw data might have been collected through underwater photography or videography, as mentioned in the first sentence of the context. This is likely to have been done during dives at great depths below sea level (often 40â€“80 m deep) to monitor coralligenous reefs. The photographs or videos might have been taken by researchers or divers, and then annotated to create a dataset for training and testing the deep learning models.

In summary, while the exact methods for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated, it is likely that underwater photography or videography was used to collect the data, which was then annotated to create a dataset for deep learning.
