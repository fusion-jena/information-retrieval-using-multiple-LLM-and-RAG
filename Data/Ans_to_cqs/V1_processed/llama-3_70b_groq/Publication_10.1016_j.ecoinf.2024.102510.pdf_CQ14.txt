The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a hybrid approach called the Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization Scheme (HHOS). This approach combines manual and random search methods sequentially. The first step is manual search, which aims to identify optimal hyperparameter values and reduce the search space. This is achieved by selecting frequently used hyperparameter configurations that show effectiveness in related studies, after understanding the problem at hand. Next, random search iteratively samples various combinations of hyperparameter values identified in the manual search, trains the models with each set, and identifies the hyperparameter configuration that yields the highest accuracy.
