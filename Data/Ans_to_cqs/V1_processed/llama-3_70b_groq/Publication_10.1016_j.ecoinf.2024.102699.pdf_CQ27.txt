Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, data augmentation strategies, and training processes for birdsong classification using Vision Transformers (ViT) and DenseNet-161. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
