I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the deep learning module, specifically the multilayer perceptron (MLP), and the input data processing techniques, such as batch normalization. It also discusses the training set and constraint factors, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
