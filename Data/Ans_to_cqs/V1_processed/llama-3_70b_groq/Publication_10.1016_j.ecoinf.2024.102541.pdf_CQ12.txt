Based on the provided context, it appears that the pipeline uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. This is evident from the mention of "dense convolutional neural networks" in the paper by Tiwari et al. (2021) and "deep convolutional neural network" in the paper by Verma and Gupta (2018). Additionally, the context mentions "convolutional kernel size (k2)" and "number of input Cin and output Cout channels" which are typical parameters of a CNN model. There is no mention of RNN or Transformer models in the provided context.
