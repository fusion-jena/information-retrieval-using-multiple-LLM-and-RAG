I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to habitat classification and mapping, discussing different classes of habitats, such as grasslands, wetlands, and woodlands, and their characteristics. It also mentions the use of EO-data (Earth Observation data) in Wales, but it does not provide any information about the specific techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
