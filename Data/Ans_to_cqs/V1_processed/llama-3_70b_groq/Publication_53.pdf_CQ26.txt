The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the overall methodology, results, and statistical analyses used in the study, but it does not provide specific details on data preprocessing and bias handling.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It is possible that the authors may have addressed data bias in their preprocessing pipeline, but this information is not available in the given text.
