The purpose of the deep learning model in the context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for classification. The context mentions the development of fire risk maps, which involves categorizing areas into different susceptibility classes (low, medium, high, and extreme). The use of machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests, also suggests that the purpose is classification. Additionally, the context mentions the use of AUC values to measure the performance of the models, which is a common metric used in classification problems. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically to classify areas into different fire risk categories.
