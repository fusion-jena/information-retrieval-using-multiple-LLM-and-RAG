The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the analysis of urban acoustic environments, sound event classification, and psychoacoustics. It discusses the limitations of classical approaches in analyzing large datasets and the use of machine learning approaches for sound event classification. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide any information on data preprocessing, stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in the context of deep learning pipelines.
