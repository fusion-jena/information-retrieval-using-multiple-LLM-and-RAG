Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model optimization process, including hyperparameter tuning using the Hyperband algorithm, and the experimental design. It also mentions data standardization and the use of Python, PyCharm, Keras, and TensorFlow for the analysis.

However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that are typically performed after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
