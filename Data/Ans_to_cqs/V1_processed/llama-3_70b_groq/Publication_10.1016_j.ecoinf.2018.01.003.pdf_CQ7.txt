Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily discusses the development of neural networks, Bayesian learning machines, and support vector machines (SVMs), as well as their applications and advantages. It also explains the basics of neural networks and SVMs, including their mathematical formulations. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
