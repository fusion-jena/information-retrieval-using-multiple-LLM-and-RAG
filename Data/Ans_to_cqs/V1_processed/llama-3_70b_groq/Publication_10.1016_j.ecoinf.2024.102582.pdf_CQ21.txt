Based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that a manual visual interpretation approach was used to correct the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effectively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves resulting from “spectral confusion”. 

There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix as post-processing steps. The context only provides information about the model training using the random forest algorithm and the correction of misclassifications through manual visual interpretation.
