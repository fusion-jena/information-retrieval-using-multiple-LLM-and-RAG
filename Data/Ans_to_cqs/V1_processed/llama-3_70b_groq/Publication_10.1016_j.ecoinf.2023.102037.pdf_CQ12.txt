The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a variant of YOLO (You Only Look Once), specifically YOLOv5. This is mentioned in the context as "In this version of the model, a Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer is used as the model back-bone and a path aggregation network (PANet) as neck to boost information flow. The head in YOLOv5 achieves multi scale prediction by generating different output feature maps." This indicates that the model used is a YOLOv5 model with a CSPNet backbone and PANet neck.
