The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on deep learning-based denoising methods for bioacoustics applications, discussing challenges in generating training data, and evaluating traditional and deep learning-based audio enhancement methods.

However, it does mention the difficulty in collecting clean recordings, especially in bioacoustics applications, which may lead to biased datasets. It also highlights the importance of developing large-scale datasets, which could be affected by data bias.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
