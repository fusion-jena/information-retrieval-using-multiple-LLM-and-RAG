Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that random under sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set to address imbalances. This suggests that undersampling is one of the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the machine learning pipeline. However, there is no mention of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or diverse data collection.
