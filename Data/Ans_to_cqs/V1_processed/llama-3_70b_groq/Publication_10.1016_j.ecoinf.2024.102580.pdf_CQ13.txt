The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions the object queries parameter of the DETR model, which was set to 100, allowing for the detection of up to 100 turtles in an image. Additionally, it mentions the pre-processing steps for the images, including normalizing the color channels based on the ImageNet dataset used in the training of the pre-trained RestNet-50 model. However, it does not provide information on the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
