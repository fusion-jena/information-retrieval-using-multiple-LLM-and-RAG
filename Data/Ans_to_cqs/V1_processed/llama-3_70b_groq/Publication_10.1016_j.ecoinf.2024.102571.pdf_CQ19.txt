The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. The text only describes the architecture of the neural network, which is a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture, and the activation functions used. It does not mention the specific framework used to implement this model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
