The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This is explicitly mentioned in the context, where it is stated that "The encoder and decoder neural networks are parameterised by θ and φ, respectively" and "The VAE uses a bottleneck L = 2 to create the latent representation." Additionally, the context provides details about the architecture of the VAE, including the number of fully connected layers and the activation functions used. There is no mention of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
