I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning algorithms for bacterial image recognition in environmental samples, but it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. The authors mention that they provide guidelines for dataset preparation and training, but they do not specify a repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
