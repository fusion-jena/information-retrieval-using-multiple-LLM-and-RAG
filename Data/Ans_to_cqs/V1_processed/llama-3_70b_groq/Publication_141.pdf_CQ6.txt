The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that data augmentation was applied by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle due to the small sample size. This suggests that the images were not normalized or scaled before training, but rather augmented to increase the diversity of the training data.

Additionally, the context does not mention any specific cleaning or preprocessing steps, such as removing outliers or handling missing values. It is possible that these steps were performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
