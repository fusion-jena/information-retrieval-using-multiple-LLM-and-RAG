The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the context, which mentions that "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a subset of DNNs that are specialized for image classification tasks and pattern recognition." The context also describes the architecture of the CNN model, which consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
