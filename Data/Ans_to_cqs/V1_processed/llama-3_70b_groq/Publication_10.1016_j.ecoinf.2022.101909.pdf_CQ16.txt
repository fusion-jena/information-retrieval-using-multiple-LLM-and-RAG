The criteria used to determine when training is complete is the early stopping method with a patience equal to 5. This means that the training process will stop when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving for 5 consecutive epochs. In this case, the optimal training was achieved at the end of the ninth epoch, reaching a maximum loss of 3 for the training and validation subsets.
