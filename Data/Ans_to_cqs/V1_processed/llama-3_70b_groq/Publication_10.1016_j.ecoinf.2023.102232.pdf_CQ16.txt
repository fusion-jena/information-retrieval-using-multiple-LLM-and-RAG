The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the description of the LS algorithm and the genetic algorithm, their steps, and their interactions. It explains how the algorithms work together to estimate model parameters, but it does not provide information about the stopping criteria for the training process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
