The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on machine learning and geostatistical methods for evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps, particularly in situations where data availability is limited. It discusses methods such as cross-validation, resampling, and weighted approaches to address issues related to spatial clustering and sampling design. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
