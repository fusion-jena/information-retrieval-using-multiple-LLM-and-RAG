I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to discuss the use of the Minimum Weight Spanning Tree (MWST) algorithm for clustering and network analysis, as well as references to various studies on coral reefs and marine ecosystems. However, it does not provide information on deep learning model training or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
