The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning models, but it discusses the evaluation of various machine learning (ML) models. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these ML models include:

1. R2 (coefficient of determination): measures goodness of fit
2. NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency): assesses performance relative to benchmarks
3. MEF (Model Efficiency): assesses performance relative to benchmarks
4. Z-statistics: determines statistical significance
5. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): measures prediction accuracy
6. MAE (Mean Absolute Error): measures prediction accuracy
7. Taylor statistics: provides a holistic visualization of multiple metrics

These metrics offer distinct perspectives, allowing for a tailored evaluation based on specific modeling objectives and dataset characteristics.
