The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the chosen values of the hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, weight decay, and Adam optimizer hyperparameters. It does not provide information on whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize these hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
