Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the process of image format conversion, sample extraction, and band selection for deep learning classification of forest types. It discusses the use of ArcPy to divide forest types into image units, rotating images to generate new units, and overlapping images to increase the number of samples. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
