I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture and performance of the Res_AUNet network, the experimental setup, and the evaluation metrics used. However, it does not provide information about where the code is hosted or made available. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the code repository.
