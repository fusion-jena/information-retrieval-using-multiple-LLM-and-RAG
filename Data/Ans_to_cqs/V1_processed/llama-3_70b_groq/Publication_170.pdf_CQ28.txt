The provided context does not mention a specific cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the model was trained on a desktop personal computer (PC) and a high-performance server with multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). It does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
