The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of a deep neural network for image classification, specifically for camera trap images, but it does not mention well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It appears that the authors have used a custom dataset for their specific application, but the details of the dataset are not provided. Therefore, I don't know the specific dataset used in this deep learning pipeline.
