Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the problem of limited dataset, data augmentation, few-shots learning, and the experiments conducted with different datasets and architectures. It provides the results of the experiments, including the mean accuracy and standard deviation of the model on the test dataset. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
