Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, some hints can be gathered from the text.

In the context of air quality modeling, it is mentioned that acoustic data is utilized, which might be collected using sensors or audio recording devices. Additionally, the text mentions the use of EEG signals in driver drowsiness estimation, which are typically collected using electroencephalography sensors.

Furthermore, the text mentions the use of public datasets, such as the Housing dataset, synthetic dataset, and Email spam filtering text dataset, among others. These datasets might be collected through various means, including surveys, online data scraping, or other methods.

However, it is essential to note that the context does not provide a comprehensive list of methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer without additional information.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that sensors, public datasets, and possibly surveys might be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, more information is needed to provide a more detailed answer.
