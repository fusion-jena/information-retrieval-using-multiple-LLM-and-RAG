The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions the hyperparameters determined using grid search, such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs, but it does not specify how these hyperparameters are used to determine the completion of training. 

It is common in deep learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or a specific number of epochs to determine when training is complete. However, this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this case.
