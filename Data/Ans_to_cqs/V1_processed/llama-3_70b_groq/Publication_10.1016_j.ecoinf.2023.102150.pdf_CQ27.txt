Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the training and retraining of the model, including the architecture used, the optimizer, and the number of images used for training, validation, and testing. It also discusses the quality check and manual classification of images. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
