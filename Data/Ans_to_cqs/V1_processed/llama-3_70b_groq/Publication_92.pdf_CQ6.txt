The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that the authors worked with biology experts to label many videos, cropped some frames of the videos, and created a training database composed of 13,000 fish thumbnails. The thumbnail size varies from a minimum of 20 × 40 pixels to a maximum of 150 × 200 pixels. Each thumbnail contains only one labeled fish.

Additionally, the authors applied rotations and symmetries to the thumbnails to capture all possible positions of the fishes, and added a class for the background, which is constituted with random thumbnails of the background and specific background thumbnails taken around the fish thumbnails.

It can be inferred that the authors might have performed some basic preprocessing steps such as resizing the thumbnails to a uniform size, but the exact steps are not mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
