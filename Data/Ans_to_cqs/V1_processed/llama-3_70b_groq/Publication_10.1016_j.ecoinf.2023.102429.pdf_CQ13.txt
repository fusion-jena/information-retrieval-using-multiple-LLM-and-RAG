I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer. The context mentions the use of SVM (Support Vector Machine) and other machine learning algorithms like RF (Random Forest), LASSO, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), SPA (Successive Projections Algorithm), WAPLSR (Weight Average Partial Least-Squares Regression), and MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines), but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models.
