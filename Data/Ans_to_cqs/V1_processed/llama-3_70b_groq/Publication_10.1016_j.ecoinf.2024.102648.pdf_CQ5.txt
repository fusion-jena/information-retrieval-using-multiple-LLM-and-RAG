The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on using machine learning and deep learning techniques for predicting plant disease severity, specifically Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton. The datasets used in this study seem to be related to weather parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, as well as whitefly counts, which are used to forecast disease incidence. There is no mention of popular image classification datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
