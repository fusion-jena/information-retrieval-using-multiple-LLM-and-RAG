I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The paper by Dujardin and Lehning (2022) mentions the use of deep learning for downscaling near-surface wind fields, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. The other references provided do not mention deep learning models either. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
