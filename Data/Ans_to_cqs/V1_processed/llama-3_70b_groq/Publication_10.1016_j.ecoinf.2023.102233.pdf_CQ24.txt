The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of active learning and deep learning techniques for bird call recognition, particularly in scenarios with limited training data and high costs of obtaining additional data.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a grid search technique to tune hyperparameters, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. This technique can help mitigate the effects of randomness in the deep learning pipeline by systematically exploring different combinations of hyperparameters.

Additionally, the context cites a paper by HÃ¼llermeier and Waegeman (2021) that introduces concepts and methods for handling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in machine learning. While this paper is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that the authors are aware of the importance of addressing uncertainty in machine learning models.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, but it does hint at the importance of addressing uncertainty in machine learning models.
