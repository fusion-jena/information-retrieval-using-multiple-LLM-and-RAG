I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a model or its hyperparameters, nor does it discuss optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental studies, discussing topics like desertification, grassland gross primary production, and vegetation responses to climate change. There is no mention of machine learning or model optimization, so I cannot provide an answer to this query.
