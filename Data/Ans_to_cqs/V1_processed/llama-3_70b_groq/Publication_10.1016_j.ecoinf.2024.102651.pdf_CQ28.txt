I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning models such as ResNet, ViT, and CA-Hybrid network for image classification and object detection in wildlife monitoring, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
