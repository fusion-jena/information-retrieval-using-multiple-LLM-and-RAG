I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context mentions machine learning models such as random forest (RF) and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), but not deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
