Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the model architecture, the importance of keeping classes compact in feature space, and the use of an improved SoftMax function to achieve this. It also mentions the machine configuration used for the experiments and the need to generate more data to solve the overfitting issue. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized, whether through grid search, random search, or other methods.
