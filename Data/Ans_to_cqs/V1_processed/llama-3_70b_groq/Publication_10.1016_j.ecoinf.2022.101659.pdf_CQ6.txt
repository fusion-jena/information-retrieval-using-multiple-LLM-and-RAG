The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on the analysis of valve gaping data in the context of aquaculture and shellfish farming. It discusses the collection and averaging of gaping data, as well as the use of environmental variables such as temperature and chlorophyll. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

The only mention of data processing is the averaging of gaping data over 5-minute or 1-minute intervals, depending on the deployment period. Additionally, the text mentions the rescaling of environmental variables, but it does not provide further details on the specific preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
