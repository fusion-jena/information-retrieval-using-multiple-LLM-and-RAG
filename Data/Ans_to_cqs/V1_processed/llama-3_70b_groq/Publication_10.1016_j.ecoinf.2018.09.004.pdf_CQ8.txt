I don't know.

The provided context is a research paper on seagrass detection in the Mediterranean using a supervised learning approach. It discusses the methodology, datasets, and results of the study, but it does not mention a code repository or provide a link to a specific repository where the code is available. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
