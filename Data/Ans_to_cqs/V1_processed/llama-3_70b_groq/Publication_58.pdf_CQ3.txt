The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "central-pixel labeling" and "semantic labeling" architectures, it can be inferred that the annotation techniques used are related to image segmentation.

In "central-pixel labeling", it is possible to make balanced data sets with the initial pixels selection used for the learning, which suggests that the annotation technique involves labeling pixels or regions of interest in the images.

In "semantic labeling", the composition of the images makes it more difficult to precisely control the number of pixels per class, which implies that the annotation technique involves assigning semantic labels to regions or objects in the images.

However, the context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
