Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that "a full description of the model architecture, dataset spatial split and training procedure can be found in supplementary information (SI) Box A." This suggests that the details of the measures taken to ensure generalizability may be provided in the supplementary information, but they are not mentioned in the main text.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that the model is trained on presence-only data, which may be a limitation in terms of generalizability. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of adapting deep learning workflows to handle large volumes of data from citizen science observations and remote sensing characterization of environmental heterogeneity, which may imply that the model is designed to be generalizable to different datasets and environments. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.
