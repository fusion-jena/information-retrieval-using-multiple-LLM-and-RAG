I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the YOLOv5s model and its applications in computer vision and ecological research, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. The references cited in the paper are mostly academic papers and conferences, and there is no mention of a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
