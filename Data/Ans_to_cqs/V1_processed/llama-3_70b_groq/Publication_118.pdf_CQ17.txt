Based on the provided context, it appears that no regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that "2d batch normalization" was applied between each layer, but it does not mention any other regularization techniques. Therefore, it can be concluded that the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in this specific deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned.
