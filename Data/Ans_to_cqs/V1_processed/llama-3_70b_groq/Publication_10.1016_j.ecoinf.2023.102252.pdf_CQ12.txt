I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The text discusses environmental flow, riparian ecosystems, wetlands, and biodiversity maintenance, but it does not provide information about the use of deep learning models in a pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
