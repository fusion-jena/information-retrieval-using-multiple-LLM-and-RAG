I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It provides information about the proposed model, dataset, and experimental results, but it does not include a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not available in the given context.
