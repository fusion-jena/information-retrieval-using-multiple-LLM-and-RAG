Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text focuses on the application of Elastic Net to address overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the ESK model, as well as the use of EN-SAE and KDE for feature extraction and classification. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
