The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process was stopped after a certain number of epochs (1500 epochs in this case), as the average values for the loss function were less than 0.1 at the end of the learning process.

There is no mention of a validation loss plateau being used as a criterion to determine when training is complete. The context only mentions the loss function values for the training and testing data, but it does not provide information on how the training process was stopped.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
