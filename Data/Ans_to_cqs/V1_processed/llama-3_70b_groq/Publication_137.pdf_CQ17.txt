The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention the "regularization strength" as one of the parameters that were adjusted in the experiment, which suggests that some form of regularization was used.

The context also mentions a formula (formula (3)) that describes the fidelity and smoothness of the partition results, which could be related to regularization. However, the exact form of the formula is not provided, and it is not clear how it is used for regularization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
