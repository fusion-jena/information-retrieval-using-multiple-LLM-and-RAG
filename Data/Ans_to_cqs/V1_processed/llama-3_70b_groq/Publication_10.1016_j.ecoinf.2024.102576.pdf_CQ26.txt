Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for land use and land cover classification, phenology-based multi-index, and random forest for mapping deforestation. It also discusses the advantages of using deep learning algorithms and the importance of increasing data during training to improve classification accuracy and performance.

However, it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
