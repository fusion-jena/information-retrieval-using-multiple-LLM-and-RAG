The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the CNN was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages, and that minibatch gradient descent was used during training. It also provides information about the number of epochs without improvement in validation error before training terminates early, but it does not specify the learning rate or optimizer used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
