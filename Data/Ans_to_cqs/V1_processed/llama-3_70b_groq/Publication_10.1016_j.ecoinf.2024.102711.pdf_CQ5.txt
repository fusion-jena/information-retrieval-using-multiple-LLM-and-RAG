The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on data-driven models, hyperparameter tuning, and automated machine learning (AutoML) in the context of modeling fire behavior. It mentions a limited dataset of 113 data records, but it does not specify the name of the dataset or its characteristics. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
