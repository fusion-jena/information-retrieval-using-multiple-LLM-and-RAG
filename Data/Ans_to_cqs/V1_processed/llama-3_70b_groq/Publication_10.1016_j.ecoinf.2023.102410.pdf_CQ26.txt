I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. The context appears to be related to acoustic data analysis, specifically tracking vocalizations and sound localization, and cites references from 2006, 2012, and 2013. There is no mention of deep learning or data preprocessing techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
