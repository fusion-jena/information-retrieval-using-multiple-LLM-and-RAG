Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different models (Wide-ResNet101, InceptionV3, ResNet101, and MnasNet-A1) in terms of their size, speed, and performance. It also provides information about the training process, including the optimizer used, learning rate, and batch normalization. However, it does not provide details about the dataset used or the methods employed to ensure the generalizability of the models.
