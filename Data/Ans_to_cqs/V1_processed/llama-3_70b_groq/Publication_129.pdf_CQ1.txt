Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in agricultural pest recognition and smart agriculture, citing various research papers and describing the architecture of a Faster R-CNN model. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected for these studies.

However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that the datasets used might be publicly available or collected through sensors and cameras. For example, the IP102 dataset mentioned in [19] is a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition, but the context does not provide information on how this dataset was collected. Similarly, the papers cited in [18], [20], and [21] might have used various methods for collecting raw data, but this information is not provided in the given context.

In summary, the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
