I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the experimental results, evaluation metrics, and comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It is possible that the authors used a specific method such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, but this information is not provided in the given context.
