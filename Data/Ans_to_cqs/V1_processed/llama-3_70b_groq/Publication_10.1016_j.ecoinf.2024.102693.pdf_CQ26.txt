The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different visual models, such as ViT and Volo, and their applications in computer vision tasks. It discusses the importance of pre-training data, token mixer modules, and deep transfer-learning strategies, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
