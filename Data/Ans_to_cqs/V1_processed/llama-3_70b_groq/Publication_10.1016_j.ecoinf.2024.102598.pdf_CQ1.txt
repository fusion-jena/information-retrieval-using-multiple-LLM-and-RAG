Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to forest fires and ecological informatics, discussing various techniques such as data mining, simulation models, and machine learning models. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
