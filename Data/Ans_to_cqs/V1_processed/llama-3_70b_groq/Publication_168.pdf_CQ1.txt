Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using hyperspectral images (HSI) captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This is mentioned in the keywords section, which includes "unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)" and "hyperspectral image (HSI)". 

However, the context does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets. It primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image classification.

Therefore, I can only infer that hyperspectral images captured by UAVs are used as the raw data, but I do not have enough information to provide a more detailed answer on the methods used for collecting this data.
