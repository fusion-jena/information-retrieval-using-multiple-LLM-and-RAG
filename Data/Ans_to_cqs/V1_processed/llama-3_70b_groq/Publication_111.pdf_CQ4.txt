The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting SST and SWH, and the architecture of the proposed GRU-DNN model. It discusses the use of early stopping and dropout to address overfitting concerns, but does not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
