The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a hybrid CNN-LSTM (C-L) model. This is mentioned in the text as "Fig. 2. Schematic of the architecture of the CNN-LSTM(C-L) hybrid model." and also in the title of the article "From meteorological to agricultural drought: Propagation time and influencing factors over diverse underlying surfaces based on CNN-LSTM model". This hybrid model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the processing power and robustness of the model.
