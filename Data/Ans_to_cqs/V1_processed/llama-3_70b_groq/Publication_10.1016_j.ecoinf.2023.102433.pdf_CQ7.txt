I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to a web service provided by NASA, discussing the available methods and parameters for retrieving data, as well as the formats in which the data can be retrieved. There is no mention of deep learning or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
