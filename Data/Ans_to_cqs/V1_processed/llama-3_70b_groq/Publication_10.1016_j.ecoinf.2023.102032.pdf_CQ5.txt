The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context provides information about the datasets used, which are primarily Earth observation datasets. These include:

1. Sentinel-2 Level 2A
2. Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD)
3. Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)
4. Landsat 8 Observation Land Images (OLI)
5. PlanetScope Biannual Surface Reflectance Mosaics
6. S2cloudless Cloud Probability

These datasets are used for Earth observation and are related to wetlands, ecosystem health, and land use classes in the study area, specifically in East Africa.
