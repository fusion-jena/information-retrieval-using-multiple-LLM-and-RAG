I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, hyperspectral imagery, and invasive species detection, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The references cited are mostly related to remote sensing and ecology, with no mention of deep learning or neural networks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
