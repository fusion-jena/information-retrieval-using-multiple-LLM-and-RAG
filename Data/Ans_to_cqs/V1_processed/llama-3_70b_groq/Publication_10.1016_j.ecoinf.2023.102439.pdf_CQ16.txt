The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the data partitioning, model evaluation metrics, and the performance of the W-ANN model, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for training. 

Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance metrics, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular study.
