The criteria used to determine when training is complete is when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This is mentioned in the implementation details section, where it is stated that "The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs." This implies that the training process is monitored based on the validation loss, and when it plateaus for a certain number of epochs, the training is considered complete.
