I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to research papers and studies on estimating crop evapotranspiration and reference evapotranspiration using various machine learning models and sensors. It provides information on the models used, datasets, and performance metrics, but it does not mention the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
