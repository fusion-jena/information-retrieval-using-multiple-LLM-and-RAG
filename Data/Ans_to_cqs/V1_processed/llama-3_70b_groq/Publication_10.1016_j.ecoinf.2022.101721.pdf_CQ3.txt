I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation. The context appears to be discussing species identification, machine learning, and Bayesian algorithms, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
