I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of different pre-trained networks, including EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, and their application in image-based classification tasks. It discusses the features and advantages of these networks, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
