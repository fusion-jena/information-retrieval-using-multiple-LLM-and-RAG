I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses the use of an ensemble model for species distribution modeling, but it does not provide details on the specific model architecture or hyperparameters used. The references cited are also related to orchids, ecology, and conservation, but they do not provide information on deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
