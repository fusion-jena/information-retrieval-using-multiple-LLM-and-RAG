I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the performance of the VGG16 CNN architecture, power consumption measurements, and the feasibility of deploying a battery-powered embedded system, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) was used to deploy the deep learning model.
