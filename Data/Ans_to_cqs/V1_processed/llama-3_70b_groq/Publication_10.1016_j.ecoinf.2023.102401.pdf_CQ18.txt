The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated after training using metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAp). The evaluation results are then used to adjust the model's parameters and structure to improve its detection performance. This process is iterated until a satisfactory level of performance is achieved. 

It can be assumed that the model's performance is monitored during training by tracking these metrics and adjusting the model accordingly. However, the exact strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training is not specified in the provided context.
