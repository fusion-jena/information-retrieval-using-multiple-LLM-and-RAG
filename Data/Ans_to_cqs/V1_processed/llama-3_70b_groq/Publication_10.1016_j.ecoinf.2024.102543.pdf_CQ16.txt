The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of a validation set (13% of the data) to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data, helping to prevent overfitting and ensuring generalization. This implies that the validation set is used to monitor the model's performance during training, and it is likely that the training process is stopped when the model's performance on the validation set plateaus or reaches a desired level. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated.
