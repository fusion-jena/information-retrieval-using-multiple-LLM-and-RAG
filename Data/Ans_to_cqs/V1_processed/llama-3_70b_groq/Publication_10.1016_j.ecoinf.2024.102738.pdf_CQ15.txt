I don't know.

The provided context does not mention optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification, remote sensing, and random forest classification, but it does not provide information about deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
