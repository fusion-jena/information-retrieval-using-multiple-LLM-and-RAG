The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture of the network, the use of inception layers, and the post-processing and bounding box fusion steps. However, it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
