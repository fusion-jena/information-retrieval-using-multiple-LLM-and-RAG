I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the models were implemented using the PyTorch Lightning framework, which is built on top of PyTorch, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository where the code is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
