I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context mentions machine learning models such as AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes), but it does not specify a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The paper by Zhang et al. (2019) is mentioned, which is related to deep learning, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific type of deep learning model used.
