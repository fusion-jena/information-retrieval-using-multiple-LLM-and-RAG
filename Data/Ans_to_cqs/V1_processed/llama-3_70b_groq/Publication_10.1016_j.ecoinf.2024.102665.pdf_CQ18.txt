I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The text discusses the use of MWST (Minimum Weight Spanning Tree) for clustering and dimensionality reduction, as well as the incorporation of expert knowledge into Bayesian modeling. It also mentions the use of a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm for detecting the dispersal of spotted butterfish. However, it does not provide information on how the performance of these models is monitored during training.
