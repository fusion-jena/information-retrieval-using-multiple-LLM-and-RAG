The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically for individual acoustic discrimination and monitoring of animal populations. The models, such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, are used to extract embeddings from audio samples, which are then used for classification. The goal is to overcome the current challenges in using Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for individual acoustic discrimination and achieve sustained and non-invasive monitoring of animal populations.
