The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. It discusses Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are related to SVM, not deep learning.

The hyperparameters mentioned for SVM are:

* Regularization parameter (C)
* Kernel type (linear)
* Kernel coefficient (gamma) for non-linear SVMs

There is no mention of a learning rate or optimizer, which are typically associated with deep learning models. The learning rate functions mentioned (V1(x) and V2(x)) are related to the modeling of the paradise fish's learning behavior, not a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not applicable to the provided context.
