Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the architecture of the CNN, the training process, and the application of CNNs to digitized natural history collections, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
