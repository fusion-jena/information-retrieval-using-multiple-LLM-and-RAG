Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on neural information processing, bioacoustics, and deep learning applications in bird species classification, audio classification, and ecological informatics.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention techniques for understanding and interpreting complex deep learning models, such as the analysis of embeddings. Additionally, some of the referenced papers and articles may implicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
