Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification tasks. It discusses various architectures and techniques used for feature extraction and classification, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
