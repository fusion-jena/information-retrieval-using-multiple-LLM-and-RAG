I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, optimization techniques, or any specific algorithms like SGD or Adam. The text appears to be discussing habitat suitability models, conservation areas, and ecological informatics, with a focus on predicting connectivity and measuring the coverage of core habitats and corridors by conservation areas. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
