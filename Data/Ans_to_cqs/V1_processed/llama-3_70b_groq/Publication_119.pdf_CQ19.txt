Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the Keras framework is used to build the deep learning model, specifically the U-Net model. This is mentioned in the sentence: "A U-Net implemented with Keras produced a low training and testing accuracy with segmentation results on testing data differing between repetitions." 

Additionally, the ArcGIS API for Python is also used, which provides the arcgis.learn module that implements the U-Net model with a ResNet-50 backbone pretrained on ImageNet. 

There is no mention of TensorFlow or PyTorch in the provided context.
