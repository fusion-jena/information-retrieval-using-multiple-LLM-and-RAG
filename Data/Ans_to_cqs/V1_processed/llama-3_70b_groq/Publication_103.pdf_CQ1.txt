The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that public datasets are used as a source of raw data. For instance, the context mentions the use of ImageNet, a large public dataset, for pre-training the neural network. Additionally, it refers to Herbarium255 and Herbarium1K, which are datasets specific to herbarium specimens, but it does not provide information on how these datasets were collected.

It can be assumed that the datasets were collected through some form of data collection process, such as surveys, sensors, or manual data collection, but the context does not provide specific information on these methods. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
