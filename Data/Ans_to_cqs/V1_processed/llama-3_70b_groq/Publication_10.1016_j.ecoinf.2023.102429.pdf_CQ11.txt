I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper on ecological informatics, discussing various methods such as PLSR, random forest, and convolutional neural networks, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
