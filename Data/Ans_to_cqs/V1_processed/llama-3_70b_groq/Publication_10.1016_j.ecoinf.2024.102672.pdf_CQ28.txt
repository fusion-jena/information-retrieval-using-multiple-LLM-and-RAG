I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context primarily focuses on data-driven models, machine learning, and deep learning models applied to freshwater ecosystems, and it discusses the development of classification models for predicting stratification in a reservoir. There is no mention of deployment or platform usage. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
