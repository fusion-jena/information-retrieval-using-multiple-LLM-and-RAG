I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses Environmental Niche Models (ENMs) and mentions the use of statistical analysis, machine learning, and expert-defined rules, but it does not specify the use of a deep learning model. Additionally, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in any model. The only model mentioned is MaxEnt, which is used for species richness estimation, but its hyperparameters are not discussed.
