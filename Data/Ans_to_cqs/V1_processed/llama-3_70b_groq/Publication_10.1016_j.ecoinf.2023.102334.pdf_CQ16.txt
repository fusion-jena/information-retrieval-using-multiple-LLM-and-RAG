Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text discusses the performance of the model, comparing it with other models and highlighting its stability and robustness. However, it does not specify the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, convergence, or a certain number of epochs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
