Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). The text only describes the architecture and performance of the CNNFAST network and its application in bat acoustic signal detection, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
