I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the application of deep learning algorithms, such as U-Net, Pspnet, and DeepLabV3+, to address geographical and ecological challenges, and presents a case study on fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in drylands using high-resolution satellite images. The context also provides references to various research papers and datasets, but it does not specify the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
