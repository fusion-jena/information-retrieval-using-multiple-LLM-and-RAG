Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the results of the experiment, the methodology used, and the performance metrics of the models. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it can be inferred that the training and validation sets were predefined, and the models were trained and evaluated on these sets. The results of the training and validation phases are presented in the context, but the specific criteria for determining when to stop training are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, as this information is not provided in the context.
