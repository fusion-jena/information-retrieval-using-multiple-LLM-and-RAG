I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any others. It discusses various topics related to image analysis, network structure, and filamentous organisms, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
