The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). The text only discusses the architecture of the D-Mask R-CNN model and its components, but it does not provide information about the framework used to implement it. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
