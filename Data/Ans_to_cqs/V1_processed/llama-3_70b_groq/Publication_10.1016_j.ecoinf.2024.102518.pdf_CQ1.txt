Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecology, and environmental variables, but it does not provide information on the specific data collection methods used.

The context includes tables with numerical values, percentages, and habitat-related data, but it does not mention surveys, sensors, public datasets, or any other data collection methods. The references cited are related to ecological niche models, spatial filtering, and resource selection functions, but they do not provide information on data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
