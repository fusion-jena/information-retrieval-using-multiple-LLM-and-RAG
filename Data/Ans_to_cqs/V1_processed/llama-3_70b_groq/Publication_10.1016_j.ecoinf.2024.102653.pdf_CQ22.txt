The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using conventional metrics such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance across multiple time series data points, ranging from 5 to 25 days of records per bee.
