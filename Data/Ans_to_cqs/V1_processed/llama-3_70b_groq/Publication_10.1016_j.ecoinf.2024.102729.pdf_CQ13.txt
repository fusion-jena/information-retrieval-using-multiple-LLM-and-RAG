I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be discussing the use of Random Forest (RF) models and Generalized Additive models for predicting chlorophyll a concentrations and identifying associated drivers. The hyperparameters mentioned are related to the RF model, such as the number of trees (25) used in the model. There is no mention of deep learning models or their hyperparameters.
