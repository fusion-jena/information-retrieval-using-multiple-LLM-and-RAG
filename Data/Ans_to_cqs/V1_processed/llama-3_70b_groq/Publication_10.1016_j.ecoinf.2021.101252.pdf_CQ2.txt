The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the focus is on the use of deep learning models for supervised classification of time series data. This suggests that the data format used is likely to be a type of time series data, such as CSV or other formats that can store temporal data. 

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the application of deep learning models to image and sound data in other fields, but it does not provide information on the specific data formats used in those cases. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
