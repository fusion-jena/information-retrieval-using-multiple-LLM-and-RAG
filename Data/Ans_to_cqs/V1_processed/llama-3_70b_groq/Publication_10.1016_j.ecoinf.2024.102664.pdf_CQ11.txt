I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research article discussing the use of hybrid deep learning models for algal blooms forecasting from satellite data in the Zhoushan fishery. It provides information on the models used, evaluation metrics, and results, but does not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
