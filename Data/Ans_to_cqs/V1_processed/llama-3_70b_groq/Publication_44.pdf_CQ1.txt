Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of a fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation, specifically discussing the encoder-decoder structure, Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP), and the use of ResNet-101 and Xception models as feature extractors. It also briefly mentions connected component analysis for leaf extraction. However, it does not provide information on data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
