The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that the authors adjusted two parameters from their default values: validation percentage and number of training steps. It also mentions that they compared TensorFlow classification performance based on cleaned and raw images for the Mexican species, but it does not provide information on how they handled data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
