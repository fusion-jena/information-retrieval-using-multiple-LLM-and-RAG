Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of hybrid deep learning models for forecasting algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery using satellite data. It discusses the development of the deep learning models, their evaluation metrics, and the results of the forecasting. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Since the context mentions satellite data, it can be inferred that the raw data might have been collected through satellite imagery or remote sensing. However, this is not explicitly stated, and other methods of data collection cannot be ruled out. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this query.
