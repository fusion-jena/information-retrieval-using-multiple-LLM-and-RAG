Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various topics such as deep learning frameworks, event-stream processing, and optogenetics, but it does not delve into data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention data stream clustering and event-stream processing, which might be related to data preprocessing. Additionally, the paper by Goodwin et al. (2020) discusses the application of machine learning in aggression ethology, which might involve data preprocessing. Nevertheless, the context does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
