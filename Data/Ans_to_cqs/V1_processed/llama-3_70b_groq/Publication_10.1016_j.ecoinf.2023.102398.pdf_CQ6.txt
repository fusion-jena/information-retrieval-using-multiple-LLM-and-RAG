The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It only mentions that the model is trained with a custom dataset, but it does not provide details about any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been applied to the dataset. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
