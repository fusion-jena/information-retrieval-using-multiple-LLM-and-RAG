Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the implementation of a deep neural network algorithm (IUC-NN) to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species, but it does not provide details on the regularization techniques used. The Supporting Information is mentioned as a source for details on the network architecture and training, but it is not provided. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
