Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the application of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
