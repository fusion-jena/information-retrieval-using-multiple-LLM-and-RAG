I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The references cited are research papers and articles, but they do not provide information about a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the analysis of COVID-19 cases, air pollution data, and ecological informatics, but it does not mention a specific repository where the data or pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
