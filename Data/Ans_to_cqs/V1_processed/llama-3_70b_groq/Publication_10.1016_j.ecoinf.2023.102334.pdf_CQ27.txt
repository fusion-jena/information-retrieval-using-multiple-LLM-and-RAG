Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the concept of Vision Transformers, its application in computer vision, and the architecture of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. It also provides information about the machine configuration used for the project and some references to related research papers. However, it does not provide any information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
