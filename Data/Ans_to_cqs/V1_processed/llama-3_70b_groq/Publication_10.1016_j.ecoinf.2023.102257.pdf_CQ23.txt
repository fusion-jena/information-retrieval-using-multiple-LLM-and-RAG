The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the experiment design, data collection, and statistical analysis of the tagging efficiency experiment, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the ML bounding box model.

The context mentions that the final dataset consisted of 6936 tagging events under the three treatments, but it does not provide information on the diversity of the dataset or whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based on the provided context.
