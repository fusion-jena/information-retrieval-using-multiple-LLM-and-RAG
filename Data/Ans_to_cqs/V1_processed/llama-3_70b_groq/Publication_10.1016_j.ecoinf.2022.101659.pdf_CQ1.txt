Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors are utilized for collecting raw data. Specifically, Biophys sensors are used to measure valve-gaping, water pressure, and temperature. The valve-gaping measurement is based on hall-sensor measurements, and the sensors are located in the head of the Biophys sensors. 

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. It is possible that other methods may be used in the deep learning pipeline, but based on the available information, sensors seem to be the primary method for collecting raw data.
