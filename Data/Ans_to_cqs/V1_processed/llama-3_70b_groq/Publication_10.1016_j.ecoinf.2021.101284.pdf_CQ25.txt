I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text discusses the use of a Maximum Entropy-based Ecological Niche Model (ME-ENM) to identify geographical areas with a high infection rate of COVID-19, but it does not mention deep learning models. The context also discusses the analysis of environmental and air pollution data, but it does not provide information about the purpose of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model based on the provided context.
