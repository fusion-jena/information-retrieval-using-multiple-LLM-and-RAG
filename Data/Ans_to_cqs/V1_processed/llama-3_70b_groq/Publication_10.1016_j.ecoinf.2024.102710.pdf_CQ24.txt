The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on active learning experiments, sampling strategies, and transfer learning using the BirdNet-1 model. It discusses various sampling strategies, including random sampling, uncertainty sampling, and diversity sampling, but does not address randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
