I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various research papers and studies related to remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and mining detection, but it does not provide information about the code repository of a specific deep learning pipeline. The context mentions Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud processing platform used for image processing and analysis, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
