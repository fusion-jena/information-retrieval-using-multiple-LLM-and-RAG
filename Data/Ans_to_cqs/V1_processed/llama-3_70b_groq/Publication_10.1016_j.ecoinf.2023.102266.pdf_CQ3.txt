I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a cellular automaton model for predicting real-world phenomena like wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, and discusses modifications to the model, limitations, and mathematical properties. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
