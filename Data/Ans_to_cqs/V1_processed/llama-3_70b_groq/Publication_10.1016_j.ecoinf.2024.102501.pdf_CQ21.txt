Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the experiment setup, model architecture, and performance evaluation metrics (R2, MSE, MAE) for different models. It does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
