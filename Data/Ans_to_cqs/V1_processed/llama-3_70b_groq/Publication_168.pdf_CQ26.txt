The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image are split into the training set and test set with a ratio of 1:9. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of having a balanced dataset, but it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias in this context, as it is not mentioned in the provided text.
