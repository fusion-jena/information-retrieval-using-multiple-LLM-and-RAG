I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily discusses bird species identification using machine learning approaches, specifically the BirdNET project, and its application in ecological informatics. It does not delve into the technical aspects of deep learning pipelines or randomness handling. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
