The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data augmentation as a technique to increase the amount of data available for training the proposed CNN model without actually acquiring new data.

Data augmentation is a technique used to expand the dataset into a larger one, making it more appropriate for deep learning model training. The context mentions various strategies used for data augmentation, including rotation, zoom, horizontal and vertical shift, brightness, horizontal flip, and vertical flip. These techniques assist in enhancing the efficiency of CNNs.

While data augmentation can help to some extent in addressing data bias, it is not a direct technique to address data bias. The context does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that data augmentation is used to increase the size of the dataset, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
