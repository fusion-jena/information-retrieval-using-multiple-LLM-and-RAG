I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of machine learning tools and the limitations of machine learning methods, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. It only mentions the use of NAIP imagery and massive training datasets, but it does not specify the hardware used to process these datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
