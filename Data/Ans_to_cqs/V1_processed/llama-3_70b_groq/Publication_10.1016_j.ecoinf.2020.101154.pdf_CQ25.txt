The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the model is used for regression tasks, specifically to identify potential drivers of changes in growth across two herring populations. The model is trained to predict the response variable based on the explanatory variables, and the performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). There is no indication of the model being used for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks.
