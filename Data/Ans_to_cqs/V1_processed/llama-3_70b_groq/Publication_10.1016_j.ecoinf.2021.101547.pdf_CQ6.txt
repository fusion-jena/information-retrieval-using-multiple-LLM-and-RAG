Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the mini-batch size, training iterations, and the challenges of using deep learning. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the size of the images (224 × 224 pixels × 3 bands), which suggests that the images may have undergone some form of preprocessing, such as resizing, before being used for training. Nevertheless, the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

In general, preprocessing steps are crucial in deep learning and can include various techniques such as normalization, scaling, cleaning, data augmentation, and feature extraction. These steps can significantly impact the performance of the model. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular case.
