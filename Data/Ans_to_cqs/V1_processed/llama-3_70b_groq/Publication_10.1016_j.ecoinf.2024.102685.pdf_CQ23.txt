The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. It appears to discuss a random forest classification approach. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, it is mentioned that repeated cross-validations with 10 folds and 10 repetitions were used for the seagrass meadow models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow models. This suggests that cross-validation was used to ensure the generalizability of the random forest classification model.
