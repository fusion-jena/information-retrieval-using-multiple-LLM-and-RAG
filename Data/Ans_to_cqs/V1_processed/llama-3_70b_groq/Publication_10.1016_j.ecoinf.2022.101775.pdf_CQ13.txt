The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate. However, it does mention that the Adam optimizer was used to optimize the network parameters during training. Additionally, it mentions that the batch size was set to 64 samples and the model was trained for 100 epochs. There is no mention of the learning rate, but it is likely that the default learning rate of the Adam optimizer was used, which is 0.001.
