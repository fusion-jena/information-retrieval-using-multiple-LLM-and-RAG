Based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in terms of traditional post-processing techniques such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, the context does mention a post-processing framework that involves setting a confidence threshold for each class to transform the traditional binary classification output (correct or wrong) into a three-class output (correct, misclassified, and unsure).

The post-processing steps mentioned in the context are:

1. Tuning a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class (i.e., each species) using a second and independent database T1.
2. Applying the tuned threshold to the output of the CNN model to obtain the three-class output (correct, misclassified, and unsure).

The goal of this post-processing framework is to transform as many misclassifications as possible into "Unsure" while preventing too many correct classifications from being transformed into "Unsure".
