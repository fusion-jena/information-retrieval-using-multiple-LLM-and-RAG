The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on addressing annotation discrepancies and variability in cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models. It discusses methods for assessing inter-annotator variability, aggregating annotation sets, and optimizing annotation guidelines to improve overall annotation quality.

The context does mention training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on annotations from both novices and experts, and evaluating the models on different datasets with multiple expert annotations. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
