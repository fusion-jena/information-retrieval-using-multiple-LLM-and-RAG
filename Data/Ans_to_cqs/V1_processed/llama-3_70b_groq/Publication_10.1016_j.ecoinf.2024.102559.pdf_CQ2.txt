The context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that image data is used, as the pipeline is centered on supervised ML classification algorithms to identify iceplant in freely available aerial images from the 2020 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) archive at 0.6 m/pixel resolution. The images are likely in a raster format, but the specific format (e.g., GeoTIFF, JPEG) is not mentioned. There is no indication of audio or video data being used in the pipeline. CSV files may be used for storing metadata or feature data, but this is not explicitly stated.
