Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the architecture of the 3D GAN network, the Swin Transformer classifier, and the performance of the proposed model, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
