I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the data from the STARdbi pipeline is stored or made available. It mentions that the data is uploaded to the STARdbi database using its web interface, but it does not specify whether this database is publicly accessible or where it is hosted. Additionally, it does not mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
