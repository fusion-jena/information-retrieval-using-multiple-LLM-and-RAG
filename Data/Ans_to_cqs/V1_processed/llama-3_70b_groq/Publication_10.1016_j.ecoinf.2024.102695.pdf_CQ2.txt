The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the description of the experimental setup and the attention calculation formulas, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a numerical format, possibly CSV or a similar tabular format.

The context mentions that the input and output dimensions of the encoder and decoder are set to the number of variables in the dataset, which suggests that the data is multivariate and consists of numerical values. The attention calculation formulas also operate on numerical values, further supporting this inference.

There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline. The focus of the research appears to be on predicting multivariate marine chemical data, which is typically represented as numerical values.

Therefore, while the exact data format is not specified, it is likely that the data is in a numerical format such as CSV.
