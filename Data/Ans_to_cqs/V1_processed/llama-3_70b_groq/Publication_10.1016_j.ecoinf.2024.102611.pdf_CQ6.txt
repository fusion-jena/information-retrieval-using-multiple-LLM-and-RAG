The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that in one of the studies, the image samples were subjected to initial preprocessing of "resize, segmentation, and augmentation" to increase the sample size. This suggests that these three steps may be part of the preprocessing pipeline, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, it is unclear whether these steps were performed or not.

In summary, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing steps that can be confirmed are resize, segmentation, and augmentation. Other preprocessing steps may have been performed, but they are not mentioned.
