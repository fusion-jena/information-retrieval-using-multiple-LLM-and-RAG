I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the LaDeco platform, its components, and its functionality, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is stored or made available. The context mentions various sources such as Chen et al. (2015, 2018), Zhang et al. (2020), Ho and Ho (2022), and Zhou et al. (2018a, 2018b), but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
