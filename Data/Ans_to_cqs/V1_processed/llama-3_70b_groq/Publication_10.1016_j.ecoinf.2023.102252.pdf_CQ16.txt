I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a ecological model called FERM, and it discusses various parameters and equations used in the model. However, it does not mention anything about training a model or determining when training is complete. The context seems to be focused on the ecological application of the model, rather than the machine learning or training aspects. Therefore, I couldn't find any information that would suggest what criteria are used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau.
