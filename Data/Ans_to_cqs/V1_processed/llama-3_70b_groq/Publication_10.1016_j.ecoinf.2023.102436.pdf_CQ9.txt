I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The "Data availability" section only states that "Data will be made available on request", but it does not specify a particular repository or platform where the data can be found. Additionally, the context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or related information. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
