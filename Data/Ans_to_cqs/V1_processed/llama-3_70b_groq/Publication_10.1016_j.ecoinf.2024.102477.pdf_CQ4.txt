I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on deep learning methods, specifically SLSTM and SGRU models, and their applications in time-series prediction and forecasting. It discusses the architecture and performance of these models, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
