The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function. This loss function measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value. Minimizing this difference indicates a better training effect. The BCE loss function is expressed as L BCE = - ∑H ∑W (G(x, y)logSpre(x, y) + (1 - G(x, y))log(1 - Spre(x, y))), where (x,y) is the pixel coordinate, H and W are the height and width of the image, respectively, G is the ground-truth, and Spre is the final predicted saliency map.
