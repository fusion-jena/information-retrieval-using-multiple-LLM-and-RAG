Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the architecture and implementation of the neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras, as well as the training process, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
