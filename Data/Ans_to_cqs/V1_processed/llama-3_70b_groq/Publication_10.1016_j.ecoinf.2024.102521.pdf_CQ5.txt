The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a dataset called Pest24, which is a large-scale very small object dataset of agricultural pests for multi-target detection. Additionally, it mentions that the dataset used in STARdbi is limited and only encompasses a tiny fraction of insect diversity, implying that it is a custom dataset specific to the project. There is no mention of popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the pipeline.
