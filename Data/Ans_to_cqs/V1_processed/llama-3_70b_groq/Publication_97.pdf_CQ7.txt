Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the data was split based on the site numbers of the satellite images.

According to the text, "Satellite images for sites #1, #3, #5, #7-10 were used for training and #2, #4, #6 for validation." This suggests that the data was split based on the site numbers, with some sites used for training and others used for validation. There is no mention of a test set, but it can be assumed that the assessment of the network training was performed on sub-images generated from image #2, which is part of the validation set.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a clear explanation for why these specific site numbers were chosen for training and validation.
