I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on dimensionality reduction methods, specifically UMAP, and its application to species distribution modeling and population genetics. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
