The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors aim to address issues such as class imbalance and sampling bias in their approach.

Although the context does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias, it can be inferred that the authors are aware of the importance of addressing class imbalance, which is a common issue in machine learning datasets. This suggests that they may have employed techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to mitigate the effects of class imbalance. However, without explicit mention, it is unclear which specific techniques were used.

It is worth noting that the context focuses more on the architecture and training of the deep learning model, rather than the preprocessing steps. Therefore, it is possible that the authors may have addressed data bias during preprocessing, but the details are not provided in the given context.
