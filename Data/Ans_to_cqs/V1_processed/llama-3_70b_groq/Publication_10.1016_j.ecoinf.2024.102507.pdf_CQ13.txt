Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only provides information about the architecture of the models (VGG19 and ResNet50), the input shape, and the activation functions used in the dense layers. It also mentions the use of dropout layers and the concatenation of features from VGG19 and ResNet50. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
