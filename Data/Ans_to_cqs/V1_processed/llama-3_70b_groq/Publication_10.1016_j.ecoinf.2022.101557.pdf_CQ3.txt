The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text only mentions that the areas annotated as wetlands by a human are colored with blue and shown in Figure 4(c), and that the corresponding annotation produced by a CNN is shown in Figure 4(d). 

However, it can be inferred that the annotation technique used in this context is likely a form of semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a specific class (in this case, wetland or not). This is because the annotations are shown as colored areas in the figure, indicating that each pixel in the image has been assigned a label.

It is not possible to determine from the provided context whether other annotation techniques, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are used in the pipeline.
