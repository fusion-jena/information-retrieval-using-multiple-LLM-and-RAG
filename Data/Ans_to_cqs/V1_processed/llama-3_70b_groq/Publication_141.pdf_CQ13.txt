Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions that a two-stage process was used to train the CNN model, with smaller learning rates used in the second stage for fine-tuning. However, it does not provide specific values for the learning rate or the optimizer used. Therefore, I don't know the exact hyperparameters used in the model.
