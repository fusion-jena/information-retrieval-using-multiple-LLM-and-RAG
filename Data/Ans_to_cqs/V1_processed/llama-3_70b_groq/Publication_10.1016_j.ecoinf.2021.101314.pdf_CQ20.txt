I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models, GPUs, or TPUs. It appears to be discussing a method for redescription mining, which involves setting parameters and thresholds to generate redescriptions, and then filtering and ranking them based on accuracy and similarity. The context mentions that the method was run on a commodity laptop, but it does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model.
