Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and their applications in ecological informatics. It also provides some mathematical formulations for ANN and SVM, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions a paper by Huang and Wang (2006) that discusses a GA-based feature selection and parameters optimization for Support Vector Machines. This suggests that Genetic Algorithm (GA) might be used for hyperparameter optimization in some cases, but it is not clear if this is the only method used or if other methods like grid search or random search are also used.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, but it is possible that Genetic Algorithm might be used in some cases.
