I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and various algorithms such as FLAASH, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
