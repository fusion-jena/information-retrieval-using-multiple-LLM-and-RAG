The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention selective classification, which requires well-calibrated networks to assess the reliability of the output. The SGR algorithm is used to provide accurate thresholds, allowing the user to filter predictions based on the required level of error. 

The context also mentions that top-5 accuracy was consistently above 80% on the rejected part of the test set, regardless of the desired risk specified for input into the SGR algorithm. This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation is being performed, but the specific details are not provided.

In summary, while the context does not provide a comprehensive list of post-processing steps, it does mention the use of the SGR algorithm for selective classification and the calculation of top-5 accuracy.
