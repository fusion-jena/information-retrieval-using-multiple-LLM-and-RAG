Based on the provided context, I don't see any information related to deep learning model training or splitting data into train, test, and validation sets. The context appears to be focused on geostatistical analysis, soil properties, and spatial predictions, with mentions of metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for evaluating model performance. However, these metrics are used in the context of spatial interpolation and cross-validation, not deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
