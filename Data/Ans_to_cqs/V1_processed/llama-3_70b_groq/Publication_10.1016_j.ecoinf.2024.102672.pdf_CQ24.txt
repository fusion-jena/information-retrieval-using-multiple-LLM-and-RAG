Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models in predicting algal blooms and water temperature profiles, as well as reservoir stratification. It discusses the use of various models, such as support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and classification models, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention hyperparameters tuning, which can be related to handling randomness. For instance, the table provided shows the initial hyperparameters space, including learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate, which can affect the randomness in the model's output. Nevertheless, the context does not provide explicit strategies for handling randomness.

In general, strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines may include setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques like dropout and batch normalization, and employing ensemble methods. However, these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
