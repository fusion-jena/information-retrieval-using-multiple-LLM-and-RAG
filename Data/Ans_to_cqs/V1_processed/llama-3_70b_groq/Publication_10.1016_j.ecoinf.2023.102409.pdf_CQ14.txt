The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the initial learning rate was set to 0.01 and was further refined via iterative testing. This suggests that the hyperparameters were tuned through a manual iterative process, but the exact method used is not specified. It does not mention grid search, random search, or any other specific optimization method.
