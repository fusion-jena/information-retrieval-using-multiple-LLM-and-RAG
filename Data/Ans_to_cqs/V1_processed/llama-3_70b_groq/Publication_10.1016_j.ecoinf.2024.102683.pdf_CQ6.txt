Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques, attention mechanisms, and the proposed approach for identifying medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants. 

However, it can be inferred that data augmentation is a crucial preprocessing step, as it is used to artificially increase and diversify the training data. This is evident from the context, which mentions that data augmentation techniques can significantly improve the generalization ability of the network.

Other than data augmentation, the context does not provide information on specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. These steps are typically essential in preparing the data for training a deep learning model, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
