The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are partially specified in Table 2, which provides an overview of the explored ranges of hyperparameters used in the Optuna grid search. The optimal values for the three different regression tasks are displayed in the right-most three columns.

From Table 2, we can see that the hyperparameters used in the model include:

* Number of neurons in the first and second layers
* Strength of the L2 regularization term
* Solver for weight optimization (with options being 'adam' and 'lbfgs')
* Initial learning rate
* Learning rate schedule for weight updates
* Maximum number of iterations
* Maximum number of iterations with no improvement

The optimal values for these hyperparameters are task-specific and are shown in the table. For example, the optimal initial learning rate for the PEAK task is 0.0290, and the optimal solver is 'adam'.

However, it is worth noting that not all hyperparameters are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. For instance, the batch size, dropout rate, and activation functions used in the model are not specified.
