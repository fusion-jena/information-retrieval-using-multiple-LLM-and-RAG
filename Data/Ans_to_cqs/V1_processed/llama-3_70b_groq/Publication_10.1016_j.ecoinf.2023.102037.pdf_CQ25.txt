The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, specifically insect detection. This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of YOLOv5, a popular object detection algorithm, and the mention of a "insect detection model" in the training, inference, and evaluation section. Additionally, the context also mentions the use of a dataset for insect recognition and the evaluation of the model's performance in detecting insects.
