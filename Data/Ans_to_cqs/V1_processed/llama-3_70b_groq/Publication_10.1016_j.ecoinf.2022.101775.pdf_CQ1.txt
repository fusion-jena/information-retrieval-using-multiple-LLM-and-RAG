Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) as a source of data. For instance, the paper by Shah and Mishra (2020) discusses an IoT-enabled low power environment monitoring system for predicting PM2.5, which suggests that sensors are used to collect environmental data. Additionally, the context mentions that low-cost WSNs generate a large volume of information that needs to be pre-processed and maintained.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that public datasets may be used in certain applications, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, based on the provided context, sensors, particularly those used in Wireless Sensor Networks, are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
