I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only discusses the construction of the dataset, the selection of CNN models, and the evaluation of their performances. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used to preprocess the data. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
