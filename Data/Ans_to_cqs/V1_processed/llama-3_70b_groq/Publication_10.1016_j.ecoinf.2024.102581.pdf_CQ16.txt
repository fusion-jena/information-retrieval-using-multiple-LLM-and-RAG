Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on explaining the accuracy and loss curves, their interpretation, and the role of dropout in improving the model's generalizability. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it is common in machine learning to use certain criteria to determine when training is complete. Some common criteria include:

* Validation loss plateau: When the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau, it may indicate that the model has converged, and training can be stopped.
* Validation accuracy threshold: When the validation accuracy reaches a certain threshold, training can be stopped.
* Maximum number of epochs: Training can be stopped after a certain number of epochs, regardless of the model's performance.

These criteria are not mentioned in the provided context, so I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given information.
