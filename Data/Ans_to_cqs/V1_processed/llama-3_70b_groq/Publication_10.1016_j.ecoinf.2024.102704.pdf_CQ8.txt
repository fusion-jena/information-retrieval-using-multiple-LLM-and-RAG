I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various research papers and articles related to deep learning and fish passage monitoring, but it does not provide information about the code repository. The context mentions the use of PyTorch deep learning framework, but it does not provide a link or mention a specific repository where the code is available. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
