Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be a collection of model architectures, hyperparameters, and performance metrics, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
