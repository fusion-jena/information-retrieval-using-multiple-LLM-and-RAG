Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text explains the data preprocessing, the creation of the learning database, and the architecture of the neural network, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
