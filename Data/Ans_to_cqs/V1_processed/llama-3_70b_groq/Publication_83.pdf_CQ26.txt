The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on dealing with varying length audio data, feature learning, and classification performance of different methods using single CNN-based models and fusion strategies.

It discusses two methods for dealing with multi-variate varying length audio data: repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2s, and directly resizing the audio image to a fixed size. However, it does not mention any techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
