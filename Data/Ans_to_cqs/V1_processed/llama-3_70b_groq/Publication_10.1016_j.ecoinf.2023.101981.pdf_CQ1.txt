Based on the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in this study is acoustic monitoring using an acoustic recorder (Song Meter SM2 recorder, Wildlife Acoustics) deployed at each site. The recorder was programmed to record the first 15 minutes of each hour in .wav format, with a sampling rate of 48 kHz and 16 bits per sample resolution. This resulted in a total of 32,023 15-min recordings (8006 h of recording) collected from four stations (A, B, C, and D).
