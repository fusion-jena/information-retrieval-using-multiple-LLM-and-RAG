Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions the use of the Control() function to evaluate tuning parameters for model performance, but it does not specify the optimization method used (e.g., grid search, random search). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
