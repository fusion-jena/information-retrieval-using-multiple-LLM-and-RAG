Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to discuss the detection of ungulate vocalizations using machine learning algorithms and mentions the estimation of precision, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
