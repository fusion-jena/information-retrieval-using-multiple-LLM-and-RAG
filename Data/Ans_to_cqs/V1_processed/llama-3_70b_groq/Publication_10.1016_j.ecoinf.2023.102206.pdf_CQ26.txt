The provided context does not explicitly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention KFold and StratifiedKFold as methods for partitioning datasets into test data (target domain) and training data (source domain). 

StratifiedKFold is a technique used to address data bias by ensuring that the class distribution is maintained during splitting. This is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. 

The context does not mention oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques to address data bias. These techniques are commonly used to handle class imbalance issues in datasets, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the only technique mentioned in the context that addresses data bias is StratifiedKFold, which is used for partitioning datasets while maintaining class distribution.
