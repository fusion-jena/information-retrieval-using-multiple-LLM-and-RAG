The hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). This is evident from Table 4, which lists the hardware specifications of the two Oracle Cloud instances used to test scalability. The table mentions a "GPU type" column, which specifies the type of GPU used in each instance. Specifically, the Bare Metal instance uses no GPU, while the VM.GPU instance uses a NVIDIA P100 GPU. Additionally, Fig. 14 plots the performance of the Bare Metal instance versus the GPU instance as the number of devices increases, further indicating the use of GPUs in the system.
