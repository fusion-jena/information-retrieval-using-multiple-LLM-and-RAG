The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as mentioned in the context, include:

1. Optimizer
2. Activation function
3. Initial learning rate
4. Learning rate drop period
5. Learning rate drop factor
6. Number of neurons

These hyperparameters were considered for tuning using the Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization Scheme (HHOS) to improve the performance of the selected pre-trained models.
