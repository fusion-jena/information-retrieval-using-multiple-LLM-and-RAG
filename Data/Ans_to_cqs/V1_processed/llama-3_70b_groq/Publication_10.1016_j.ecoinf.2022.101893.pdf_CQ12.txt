The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the network architecture described in the context, which consists of four convolution kernel pooling layers, followed by a fully connected layer, a dropout layer, and a Dense_1 layer. The architecture is similar to a classic CNN model, and the context also mentions the use of CNN pre-training models in the proposed approach.
