Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification and mapping. It highlights the advantages of deep learning techniques, including automatic feature extraction, real-time information generation, and adaptability to evolving LULC patterns. However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
