The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), specifically a Faster R-CNN model with a Resnet50 backbone. This is mentioned in the context as "2 different versions of Faster R-CNN were created for the benchmark, Faster R-CNN (640) with an input dimension of 640 × 640 and Faster R-CNN (1280) with an input dimension of 1280 × 1280. They both used Resnet50 as a backbone..."
