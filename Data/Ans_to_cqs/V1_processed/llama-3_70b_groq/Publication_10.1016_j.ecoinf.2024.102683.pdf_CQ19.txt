The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks, and attention mechanisms, but it does not mention the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
