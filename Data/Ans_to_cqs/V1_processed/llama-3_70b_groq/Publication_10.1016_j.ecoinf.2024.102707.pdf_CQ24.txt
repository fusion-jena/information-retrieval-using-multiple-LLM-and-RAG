I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, nor does it discuss the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, ecology, and conservation, with a focus on Antarctic research and the use of machine learning and drones for species counting and habitat analysis. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or randomness handling strategies. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
