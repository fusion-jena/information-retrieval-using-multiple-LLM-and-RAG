Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are training accuracy, validation accuracy, and prediction accuracy. These metrics are used to compare the performance of different CNN models, including VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and the proposed model. The accuracy values are reported in Table 9, which presents a comparison of the classification accuracy between pre-trained CNN models using encrypted images. 

However, it is worth noting that other common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and loss, are not mentioned in the provided context.
