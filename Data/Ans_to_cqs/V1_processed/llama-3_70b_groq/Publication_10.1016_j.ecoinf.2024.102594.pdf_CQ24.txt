The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention some techniques used to enhance the training dataset, which can help reduce the impact of randomness.

For instance, the context mentions that the training set was enhanced by (i) flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, (ii) exchanging between multiple image channels while the labels remain unchanged, (iii) randomly rotating the images and labels by 90Â°, and (iv) randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged. These techniques can help increase the diversity of the training dataset and make the model more robust to random variations.

However, it does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
