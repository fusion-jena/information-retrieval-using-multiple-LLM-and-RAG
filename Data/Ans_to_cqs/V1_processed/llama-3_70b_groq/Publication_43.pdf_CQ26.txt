The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique to artificially increase the number of samples in the training set, which can help mitigate data bias. Data augmentation involves applying specific deformations on the input images, such as rotation, flipping, translation, cropping, or changing the brightness of the pixels. This can help create a more diverse dataset and reduce the impact of bias in the original dataset.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques to address data bias. These techniques are commonly used to handle imbalanced datasets or biased data, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the only technique mentioned in the context that can help address data bias is data augmentation. However, it is not a direct answer to the query, and other techniques mentioned in the query are not discussed in the provided context.
