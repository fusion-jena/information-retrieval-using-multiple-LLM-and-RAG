I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the software tools and libraries used, such as Python, Theano, Lasagne, and Librosa, but does not provide information about the hardware resources. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
