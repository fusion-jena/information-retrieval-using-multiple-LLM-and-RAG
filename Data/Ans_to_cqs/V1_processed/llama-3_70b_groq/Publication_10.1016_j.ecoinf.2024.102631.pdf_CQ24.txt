The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of a neural network, including the use of Spatial and Channel Attention modules, the decoder architecture, and the loss functions used. It also describes the PatchGAN discriminator and the spatial attention mechanism in detail.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
