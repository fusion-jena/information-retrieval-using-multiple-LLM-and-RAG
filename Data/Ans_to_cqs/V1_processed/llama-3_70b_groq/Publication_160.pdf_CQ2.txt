Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The text mentions image classification, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and datasets such as ImageNet, which are all related to image processing. Additionally, the context discusses the application of CNNs to underwater benthic species recognition and coral reefs species identification, which also involve image data.

There is no explicit mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "underwater video" in one instance, but it is not clear if the video data is being used as input to the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image data is the primary format used in the deep learning pipeline.
