I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or the hardware resources used for it. The context appears to be discussing ecological informatics, species abundance, and performance measures for classification and predicted distribution, but it does not provide any information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
