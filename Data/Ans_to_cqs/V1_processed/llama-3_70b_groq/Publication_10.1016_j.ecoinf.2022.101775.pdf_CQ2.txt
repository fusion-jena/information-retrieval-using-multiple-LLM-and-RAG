The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on matrix factorization, deep learning, and their applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and natural language processing. 

However, based on the mentioned applications, it can be inferred that the data formats might include CSV (Comma Separated Values) or other tabular data formats, as they are commonly used in WSNs and natural language processing. Additionally, the context mentions "sensors" and "time instants," which suggests that the data might be in a time-series format. 

But, there is no explicit mention of image, audio, or video data formats, which are typically used in computer vision and audio processing applications. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these formats are used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
