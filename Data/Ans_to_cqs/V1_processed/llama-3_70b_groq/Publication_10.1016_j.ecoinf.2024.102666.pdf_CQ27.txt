I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and atmospheric correction, discussing topics such as satellite images, sensors, and in-situ measured data. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
