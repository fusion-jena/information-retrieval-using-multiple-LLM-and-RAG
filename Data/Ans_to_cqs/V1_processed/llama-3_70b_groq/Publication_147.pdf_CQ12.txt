The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a U-Net architecture. This is mentioned in the text as "The segmentation convolutional neural network was implemented in the Python programming language using the Keras deep learning library. The specific architecture used was a U-Net CNN, which was originally developed for biomedical image segmentation."
