I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the BirdNET app, Xeno-canto, and eBird, but does not provide information about the code repository. The context mentions a research paper by Wood et al. (2022) that describes the machine learning-powered BirdNET app, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
