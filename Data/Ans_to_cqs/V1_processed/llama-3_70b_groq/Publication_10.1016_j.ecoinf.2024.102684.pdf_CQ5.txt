The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the use of pre-trained networks, fully connected network architectures, and transfer learning, but it does not specify the datasets used. It appears that the authors are working with remote sensing data, but the specific datasets are not named. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
