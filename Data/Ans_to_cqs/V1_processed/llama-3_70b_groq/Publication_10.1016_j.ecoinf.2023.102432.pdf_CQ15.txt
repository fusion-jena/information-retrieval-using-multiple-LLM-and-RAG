I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses MTMI-SMF, a machine learning algorithm, and its comparison with Random Forest, another machine learning approach. It also touches on multiple-instance learning, a technique used to handle imperfect data. However, it does not provide any information about deep learning or optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
