I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing the optimization of parameters for a Landcover Trajectory (LTR) algorithm, specifically for detecting wildfires, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
