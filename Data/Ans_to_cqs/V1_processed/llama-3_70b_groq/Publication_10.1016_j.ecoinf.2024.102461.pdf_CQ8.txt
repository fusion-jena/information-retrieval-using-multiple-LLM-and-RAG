I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be from a research paper or article discussing fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, and it does not provide any information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
