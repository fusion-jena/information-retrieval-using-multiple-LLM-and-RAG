The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the architecture of the neural network, which is a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture, and the activation functions used, which are tansig, tansig, and purelin, respectively. It also mentions the input factors and the predicted output, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
