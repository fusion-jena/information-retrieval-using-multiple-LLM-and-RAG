Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the importance of data exploration, the rise of big data, and the application of deep learning in biodiversity research. It explains the concept of deep learning, its components, and how it can be used for image recognition tasks, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
