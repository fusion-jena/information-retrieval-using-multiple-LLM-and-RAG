The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text discusses the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies in animal behavior studies, citing examples of their applications in other fields, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
