The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is text classification. Specifically, it is used for semantic analysis and identifying wildlife observations on Twitter, as well as for cultural ecosystem service assessments. The model is expected to improve in the future by including textual data from social media or applying emerging transformer-based models like BERT, which has been shown to be a promising tool for text classification.
