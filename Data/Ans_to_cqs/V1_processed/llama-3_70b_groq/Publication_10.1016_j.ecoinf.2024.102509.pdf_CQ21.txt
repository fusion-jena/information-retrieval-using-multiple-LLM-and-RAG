Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the application and benefits of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, their structure, and the process of developing an optimal neural network. It also mentions the use of the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
