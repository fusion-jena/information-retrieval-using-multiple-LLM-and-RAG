The context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing data is used, as the study involves wetland mapping in Alberta, Canada, and mentions the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, which are satellite-based remote sensing datasets. Additionally, the context mentions Google Earth Engine, which is a platform that provides access to a vast repository of remote sensing data. It can be assumed that the raw data is collected through these satellite-based remote sensing datasets. However, it does not provide information on whether surveys or sensors are used to collect additional data.
