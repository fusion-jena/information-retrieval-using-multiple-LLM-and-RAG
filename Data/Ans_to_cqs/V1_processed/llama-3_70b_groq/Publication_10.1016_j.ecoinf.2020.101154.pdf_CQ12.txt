The context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Instead, it discusses the use of Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM). GBRT is a type of ensemble learning model that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions, whereas GAM is a type of statistical model that uses a non-parametric smooth function to model the relationship between the response variable and the predictor variables. Therefore, the type of model used in the pipeline is GBRT and GAM, not a deep learning model.
