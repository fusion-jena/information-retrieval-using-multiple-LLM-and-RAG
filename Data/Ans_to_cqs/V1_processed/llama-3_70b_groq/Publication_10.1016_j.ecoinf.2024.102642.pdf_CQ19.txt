The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained on annotations from both novices and the expert, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these CNNs. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
