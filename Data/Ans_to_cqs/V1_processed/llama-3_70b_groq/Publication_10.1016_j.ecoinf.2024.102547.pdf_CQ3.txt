I don't know. The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on functional data analysis, fisheries acoustics techniques, and spatial-functional data analysis, with no mention of deep learning or computer vision-related topics. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
