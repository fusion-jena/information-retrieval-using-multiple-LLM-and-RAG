To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the dataset was divided chronologically: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy simulates real-world scenarios, ensuring that the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generalizability of the model. 

No other measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting are mentioned in the provided context.
