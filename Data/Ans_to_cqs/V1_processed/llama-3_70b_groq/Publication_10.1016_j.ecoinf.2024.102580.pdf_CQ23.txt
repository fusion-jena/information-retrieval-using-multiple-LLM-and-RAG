Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the workflow used to select a deep learning model, develop a ground-truth imagery dataset, train the models, evaluate model performance, and obtain and analyze data to quantify spatial patterns and resilience of the ecosystem. 

However, it does provide some information about the dataset preparation, such as reducing the resolution of the images in the ground-truth dataset to 1000 Ã— 1333, normalizing the three color channels of the images by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviations per channel, and using the ImageNet dataset for training the pre-trained RestNet-50. 

But it does not provide information about cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
