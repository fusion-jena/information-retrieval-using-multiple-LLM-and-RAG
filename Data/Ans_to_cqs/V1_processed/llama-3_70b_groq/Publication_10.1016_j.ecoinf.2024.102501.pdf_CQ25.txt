The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is to predict the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water. Specifically, the models are used for regression tasks, where the goal is to estimate a continuous value (DO concentration) based on input variables such as water quality parameters, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The models mentioned, including LSTM, SVR, and others, are used to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate DO concentration.
