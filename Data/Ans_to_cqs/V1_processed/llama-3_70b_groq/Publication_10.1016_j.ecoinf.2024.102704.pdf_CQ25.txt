The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection. This is evident from the mention of detection thresholds, IoU (Intersection over Union), and score in the model training section. The model is trained to detect objects, specifically fish, and the detection accuracy is measured based on the IoU and score thresholds. The model is also compared to other object detection models such as YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8, which further supports the conclusion that the purpose of the model is object detection.
