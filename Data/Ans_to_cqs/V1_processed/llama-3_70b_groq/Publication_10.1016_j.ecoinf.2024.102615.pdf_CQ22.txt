According to the provided context, the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are:

1. Correlation Coefficient (R)
2. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
4. Coefficient of Determination (R2)
5. Mean Relative Error (MRE)

These metrics are used to confirm the prediction performance of the model on the validation set. The correlation coefficient (R) measures the linear relationship between two variables, with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger correlation. The other metrics, such as RMSE, MAE, R2, and MRE, provide additional insights into the model's performance.
