The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, nor does it discuss measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model. The context appears to describe a hybrid MCMC algorithm and a genetic algorithm used to estimate model parameters from field data. It discusses the process of selecting and merging traces from multiple chains to obtain final parameter values and their uncertainty. There is no mention of deep learning, diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
