I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context appears to be a collection of references to academic papers and a list of environmental variables (BIOCLIM and PROXDIST) used in ecological modeling. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
