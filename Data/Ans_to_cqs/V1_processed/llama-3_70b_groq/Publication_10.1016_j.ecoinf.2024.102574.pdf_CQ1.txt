Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Field surveys: The context mentions "field investigation" and "field survey design", indicating that on-site surveys are conducted to collect data.

2. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology: The context mentions "LiDAR GEDI derived tree canopy height heterogeneity" and "UAV-based LiDAR" data, suggesting that LiDAR is used to collect data on tree canopy height and other forest characteristics.

3. UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) imagery: The context mentions "UAV-based LiDAR" and "hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data" collected using UAVs, indicating that UAVs are used to collect aerial imagery and other data.

4. Remotely sensed imagery: The context mentions "remotely sensed imagery" as a data source, suggesting that satellite or aerial imagery is used to collect data.

5. Forest inventory data: The context mentions "forest inventory data" as a data source, indicating that data is collected through forest inventories.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of public datasets or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in conjunction with the mentioned methods.
