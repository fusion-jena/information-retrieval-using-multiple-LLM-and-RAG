Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experiments and results of using different embedding models and active learning strategies for bird species classification. It discusses the models used, such as BirdNet, VGGish, and YamNet, and the evaluation of their performance on different datasets. However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
