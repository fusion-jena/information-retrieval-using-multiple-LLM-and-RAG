The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the networks were trained from scratch without pre-trained weights from other datasets, such as ImageNet. This implies that the dataset used in this research is not a well-known dataset like ImageNet, but rather a custom dataset. Unfortunately, the name or details of this custom dataset are not provided in the given context.
