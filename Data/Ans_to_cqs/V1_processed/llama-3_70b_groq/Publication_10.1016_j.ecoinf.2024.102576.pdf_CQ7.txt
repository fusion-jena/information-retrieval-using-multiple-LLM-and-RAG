Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that 8330 cells (half of the total) were randomly extracted as a mask for training data, and 3,332 cells (20% of the total) were randomly extracted as a mask for validation data. This suggests that the data was split randomly into training and validation sets, with a ratio of 80% for training and 20% for validation. There is no mention of a test set.
