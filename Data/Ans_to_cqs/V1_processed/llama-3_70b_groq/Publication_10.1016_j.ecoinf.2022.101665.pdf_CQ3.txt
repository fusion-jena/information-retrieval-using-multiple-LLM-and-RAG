I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be discussing thematic map evaluation, machine learning, and resampling methods, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
