The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 5 × 10-fold cross-validation. This is mentioned in the context as "the mean accuracies and standard deviations of the 5 × 10-fold cross-validations for each method and species are shown in Table 4." This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation, which is a common technique used to assess the performance of machine learning models.
