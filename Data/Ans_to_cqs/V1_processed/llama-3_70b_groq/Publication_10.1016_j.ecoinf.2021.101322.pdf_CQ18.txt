The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the training data, results of classification and regression tasks, and the advantages of using auxiliary information. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
