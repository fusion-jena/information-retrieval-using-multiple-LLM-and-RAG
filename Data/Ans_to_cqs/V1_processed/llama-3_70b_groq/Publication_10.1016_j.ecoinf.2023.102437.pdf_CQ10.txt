I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a passage from a research paper or article discussing various machine learning models, including Random Forest and LSTM, and their applications in environmental science. It cites several references to other research papers, but does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
