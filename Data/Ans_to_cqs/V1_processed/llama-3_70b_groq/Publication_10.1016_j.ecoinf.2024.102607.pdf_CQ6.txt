Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on land use and land cover (LULC) classification, random forest, and sampling strategies, but it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of vegetation index feature datasets, which might require some form of preprocessing, such as normalization or scaling, before being used as input features for a deep learning model. Nevertheless, this is only an inference, and the context does not provide explicit information on the preprocessing steps involved.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering, but the specific steps may vary depending on the dataset and the model architecture. Without more information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
