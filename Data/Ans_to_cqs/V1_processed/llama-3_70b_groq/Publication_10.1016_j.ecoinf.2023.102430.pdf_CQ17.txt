The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context only discusses the implementation of the AlexNet convolutional neural network (AN) in MATLAB, the stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer, and the hyperparameters used for training. It does not provide information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
