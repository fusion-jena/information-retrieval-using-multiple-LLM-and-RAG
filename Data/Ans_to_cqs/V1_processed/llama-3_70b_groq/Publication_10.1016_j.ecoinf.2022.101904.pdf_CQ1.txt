Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of transformers and deep learning models in natural language processing, computer vision, and remote sensing, particularly in wetland mapping. It discusses the limitations of deep learning models due to the requirement of large amounts of training data and proposes a solution to adaptively synthesize wetland training datasets.

However, it can be inferred that remote sensing data is used as input for the deep learning models, as the context mentions the classification of remote sensing imagery. Additionally, the figures provided show wetland classification maps, which might have been generated using remote sensing data.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide information on how the raw data was collected, whether through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
