I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the problem of limited ground-truth data for large-scale wetland mapping and proposes a solution using the 3DUNetGSFormer model. It also presents some results and figures, but it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
