Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the evaluation criteria for machine learning models, feature selection, and model performance statistics, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
