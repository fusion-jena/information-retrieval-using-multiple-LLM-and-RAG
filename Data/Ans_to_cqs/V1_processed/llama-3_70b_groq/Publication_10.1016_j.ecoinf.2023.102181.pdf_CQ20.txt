I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing machine learning models, specifically bagging and covariance-weighted bagging, and their application to environmental data. There is no mention of deep learning models or the hardware resources required to train them. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
