I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, being used in a pipeline. The context appears to be related to carbon emissions, energy consumption, and statistical data, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
