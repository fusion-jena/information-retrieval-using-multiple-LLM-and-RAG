I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for identifying wetland areas in historical maps, the data pre-processing and post-processing steps, and the authors' affiliations, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
