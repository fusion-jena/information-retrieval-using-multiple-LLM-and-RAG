The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is detection. Specifically, it is used for the detection of North Atlantic Right Whale Up-Calls and blue whale vocalizations. The models, such as WT-HMM, ANN, SVM, and SCD detectors, are trained to identify and classify the whale vocalizations from the data. The accuracy performance of these models is evaluated, and the results show that they are effective in detecting the whale vocalizations. Additionally, the Birdnet model is used for avian diversity monitoring, which also involves detection of bird species from audio data.
