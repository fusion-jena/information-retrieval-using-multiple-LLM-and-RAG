I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on estimating forest biomass density using field-collected data and machine learning methods, and it presents various statistics and results related to this task. There is no information about deploying a trained model, so I cannot provide an answer to this query.
