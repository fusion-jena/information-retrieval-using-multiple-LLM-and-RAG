The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the keywords mentioned in the text, which include "U-net" and "Semantic segmentation". Additionally, the text mentions that the model segmented 1195 objects, which further supports the idea that the model is performing semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, allowing for the identification of specific objects or features within the image. In this case, the model is likely being used to identify and segment individual tree species or genera within high-resolution images of tropical forests.
