The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It only discusses the training evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mAP, which are calculated from the model validation data. There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix as postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
