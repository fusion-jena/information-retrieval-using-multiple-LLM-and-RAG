The context provided does not explicitly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of random variables and stochastic elements in the model. 

For instance, the Bernoulli random variable Be(p) is used to determine whether a given cell is infected or not, and a random extraction is performed to update each cell using the probabilities derived from the neighbourhood relationship. Additionally, the Gumbel-Softmax function is mentioned as a way to approximate discrete distributions to continuous distributions, which can be useful in optimizing neural networks involving discrete variables.

The context also mentions the use of a stochastic update criterion, which yields different results for different seeds and allows the model to be used as a Monte Carlo method. This implies that the model is capable of handling randomness and uncertainty, but the specific strategies employed to do so are not explicitly stated.

In summary, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it suggests that the model uses random variables and stochastic elements to handle randomness and uncertainty. However, the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly discussed.
