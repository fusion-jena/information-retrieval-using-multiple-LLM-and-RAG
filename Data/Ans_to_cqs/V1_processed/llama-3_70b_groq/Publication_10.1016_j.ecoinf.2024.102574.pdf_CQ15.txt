I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, machine learning, and forestry-related topics, with no explicit discussion of deep learning pipeline optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
