Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the following techniques are mentioned:

* Cropping
* Flipping
* Scaling
* Rotating
* Adding noise
* Color transformation
* Random erasing

These techniques are applied to the training dataset to increase its size and diversity, which can help mitigate data bias. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are used. Additionally, diverse data collection is not mentioned as a technique used to address data bias.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the data preprocessing pipeline, and it is possible that other techniques may be used to address data bias that are not mentioned.
