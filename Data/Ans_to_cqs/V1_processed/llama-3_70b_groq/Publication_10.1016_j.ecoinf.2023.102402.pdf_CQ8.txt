I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context appears to be related to conservation biology, ecological corridors, and marine citizen science, with references to various research papers and studies. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline, so I cannot provide an answer to the query.
