I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The references cited are related to various topics such as uncertainty quantification, student academic performance, river restoration, and machine learning models, but they do not provide information about data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
