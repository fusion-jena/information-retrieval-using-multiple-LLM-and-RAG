The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is YOLO (You Only Look Once), which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed for object detection tasks. This is evident from the mention of "YOLO training losses" and "YOLOv8n" as the base model in Table 6. YOLO is a popular real-time object detection system that uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images.
