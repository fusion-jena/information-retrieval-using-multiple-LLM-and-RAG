The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are User's Accuracy (UA), Producer's Accuracy (PA), F1-Score, Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa. 

These metrics are used to evaluate the classification performance of the three deep learning algorithms, namely VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet. The User's Accuracy and Producer's Accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of each tree species, while the F1-Score is used to evaluate the overall performance of each algorithm. The Overall Accuracy and Kappa are used to evaluate the overall performance of the best model, which is VGG16 in this case.
