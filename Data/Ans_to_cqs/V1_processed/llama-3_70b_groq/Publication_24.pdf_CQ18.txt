Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text discusses the use of deep learning tools for urban ecoacoustic assessment, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and ecoacoustic surveying, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
