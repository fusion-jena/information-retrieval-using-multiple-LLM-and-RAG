Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on optimizing model performance by reducing memory access, reconfiguring computation sequences, and exploring different model scales. It also mentions various models such as ResNet-50, Inception V3, DenseNet, LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8, but does not discuss regularization techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
