I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses data preprocessing, data analytics, and data acquisition in the context of an agricultural system, but it does not provide information on techniques to address data bias.

The context mentions data preprocessing features such as data deduplication, data cleansing, data transformation, and data compression, but it does not discuss techniques to address data bias. Similarly, the context discusses different types of data analytics, such as descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, but it does not provide information on techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
