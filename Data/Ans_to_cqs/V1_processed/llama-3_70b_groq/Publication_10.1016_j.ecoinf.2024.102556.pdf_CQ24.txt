Based on the provided context, I don't see any specific strategies mentioned to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to focus on object detection and tracking models, discussing various architectures and components, but it does not explicitly address randomness or strategies to handle it.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Randomness can arise from various sources, including random initialization of model weights, random shuffling of training data, and random sampling of mini-batches. To handle randomness, deep learning practitioners often employ strategies such as:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like dropout and data augmentation to reduce overfitting and increase model robustness.
3. Averaging model predictions over multiple runs with different random seeds to reduce variability.
4. Employing ensemble methods that combine multiple models trained with different random initializations.

These strategies can help mitigate the effects of randomness and improve the reliability of deep learning models. However, without more specific context or information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer.
