I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a snippet from a research paper or article discussing deep learning methods and their applications, but it does not provide any information about a code repository or a link to access the code. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
