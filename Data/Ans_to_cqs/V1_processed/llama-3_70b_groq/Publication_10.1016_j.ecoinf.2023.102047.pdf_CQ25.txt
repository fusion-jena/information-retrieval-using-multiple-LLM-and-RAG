The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection. Specifically, it is used to detect seagrass coverage in images. The model is based on the EfficientDet architecture, which is a popular object detection algorithm. The model is trained to predict class probabilities and refine bounding boxes around the detected objects, in this case, seagrass. The goal is to accurately locate and classify seagrass in images, which is a common task in computer vision.
