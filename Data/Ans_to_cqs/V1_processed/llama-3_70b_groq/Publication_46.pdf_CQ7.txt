The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on explaining the architecture and functionality of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their application in species distribution modeling. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria for model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
