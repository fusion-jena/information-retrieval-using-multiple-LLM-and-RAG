Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the dataset, spectral bands, vegetation indices, soil indices, water indices, and cluster inputs, as well as the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes based on the CLC methodology. It also discusses the sampling strategy and training area selection.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of validation areas and testing samples in the sampling size and validation areas section. This implies that some form of model evaluation or validation might be involved after model training, but the specific postprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
