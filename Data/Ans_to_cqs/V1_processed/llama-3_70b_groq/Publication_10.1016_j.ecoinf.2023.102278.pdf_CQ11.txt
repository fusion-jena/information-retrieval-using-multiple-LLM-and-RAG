I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various research papers and articles, but it does not provide a direct link to a data repository.

However, it's worth noting that one of the references mentions GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), which is a data repository for biodiversity information. But it's not clear if this is related to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
