I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to nighttime light images, population simulation, and bioclimate variables, but it does not provide information about deep learning datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
