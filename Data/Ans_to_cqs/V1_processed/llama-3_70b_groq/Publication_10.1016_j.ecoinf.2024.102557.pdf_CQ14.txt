The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization. This is stated in the text as "Model hyperparameters were tuned for each species-specific model using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation". This approach is implemented in the R package "mlr3mbo".
