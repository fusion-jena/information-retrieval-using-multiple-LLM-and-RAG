I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or random seed values. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, mapping, and scientific communication, with a focus on issues with visualization and color representation, particularly for individuals with color vision deficiency. There is no mention of deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
