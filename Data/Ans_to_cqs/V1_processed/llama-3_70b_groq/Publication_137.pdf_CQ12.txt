The pipeline uses a combination of two deep learning models: PointNet and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). PointNet is a type of neural network designed to process point cloud data, and GRU is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). There is no mention of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) or Transformer in the provided context.
