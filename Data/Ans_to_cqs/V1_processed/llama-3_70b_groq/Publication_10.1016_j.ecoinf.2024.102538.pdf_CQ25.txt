The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is designed for bird sound identification. The model takes in birdsong information and outputs predicted scores representing the probability of each class within the K classification levels. The ultimate goal is to learn the model parameters through end-to-end training to enable the model for bird sound identification.
