The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be focused on various machine learning and signal processing techniques, including neural networks, Gaussian regression, support vector machines, long short-term memory (LSTM), multi-gene genetic programming, M5 trees, wavelet packet energy-entropy feature extraction, and principal component analysis. 

However, it does mention the use of FORTRAN as a computational platform and Eureqa, which is a software tool for data-driven modeling. There is no mention of popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which framework is used to build the deep learning model based on the provided context.
