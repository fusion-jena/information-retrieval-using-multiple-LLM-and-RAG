Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that an accuracy assessment was conducted on the map, which likely involved calculating metrics and creating a confusion matrix. 

The context mentions that "conducting an accuracy assessment on the map" is one of the phases in producing iceplant location maps and coverage statistics. Additionally, a confusion matrix is provided in Table A.8, which suggests that it was used for accuracy assessment. 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps. Therefore, it can be concluded that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are limited to accuracy assessment, metrics calculation, and creating a confusion matrix.
