The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters used for the CNN and SVM models, as well as the performance metrics of these models. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of early stopping, which is a regularization method used to prevent overfitting. Early stopping involves stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, rather than continuing to train until the maximum number of epochs is reached. This can help prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.

Other than early stopping, the context does not mention any other regularization methods, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the provided context what other regularization methods may have been used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
