Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the use of pre-trained models, transfer learning, and active learning strategies for bird species classification tasks. It discusses the performance of different embedding models, including BirdNet, VGGish, and YamNet, but does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
