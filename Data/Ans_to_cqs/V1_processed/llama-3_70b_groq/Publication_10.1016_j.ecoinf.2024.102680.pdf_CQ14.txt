Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the experimental results of various algorithms on the URPC 2020 dataset, the architecture of the UODN model, and the evaluation metrics used. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
