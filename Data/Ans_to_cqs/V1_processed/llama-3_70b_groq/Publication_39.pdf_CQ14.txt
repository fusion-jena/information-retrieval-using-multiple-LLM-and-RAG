The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that different settings of momentum and weight decay are checked but show no improvements, suggesting that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed. However, the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, is not mentioned. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
