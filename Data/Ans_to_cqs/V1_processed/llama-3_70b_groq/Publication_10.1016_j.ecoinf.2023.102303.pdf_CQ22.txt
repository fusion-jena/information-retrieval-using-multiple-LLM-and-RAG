The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are accuracy, precision, F1-score, AUC-ROC, sensitivity, specificity, miss rate, and fall-out. These metrics are used to measure the true and false classification probabilities of the model.

Specifically, Table 2 compares the performance of the semi-supervised contrastive learning DNN and the weakly-supervised XGBoost ensemble of DNNs with recent publications in the literature, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Table 3 compares the performance of the semi-supervised contrastive learning DNN, the weakly-supervised XGBoost ensemble, and a typical supervised deep learning model, using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, miss rate, and fall-out.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, including its ability to correctly classify fish and no-fish frames, as well as its robustness to false positives and false negatives.
