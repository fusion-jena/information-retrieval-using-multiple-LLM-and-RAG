Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experiment's objective, materials, and methods, as well as the results and discussion of the impact of machine learning (ML) model performance on tagging efficiency. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, that are typically involved before training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
