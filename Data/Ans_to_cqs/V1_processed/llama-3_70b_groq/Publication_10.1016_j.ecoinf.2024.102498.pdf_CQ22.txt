The provided context mentions several metrics used to evaluate the performance of a model, but it does not specifically mention a deep learning model. However, it does provide a list of metrics used for evaluating the performance of a model in general. 

For classification tasks, the metrics mentioned are precision, recall, and F1 score. Precision indicates the proportion of positive predictions correctly classified as positive. Recall shows the proportion of truly positive cases that the model correctly identified among all the actual positive cases. The F1 score is a geometric mean of both precision and recall criteria, offering a more robust evaluation, especially when there is an imbalance in the data distribution among classes.

For evaluating the performance of the generated LULC map in simulating meteorological parameters, statistical metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Bias are used.

Additionally, the context mentions accuracy as a metric, specifically stating that SVM yielded better results with an accuracy of 87.99%. 

It is worth noting that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, and it may depend on the specific task and problem being addressed.
