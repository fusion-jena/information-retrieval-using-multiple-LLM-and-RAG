Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context only provides the number of images for training and validation (7773 and 1943, respectively), but it does not explain how the data was split into these two sets.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this particular study.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
