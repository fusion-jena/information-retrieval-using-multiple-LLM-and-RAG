The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only discusses the application of deep learning in aerial surveys for wildlife conservation and provides details on the fine-tuning process, but it does not specify the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
