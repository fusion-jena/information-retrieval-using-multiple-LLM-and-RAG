I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context appears to be discussing various research papers and studies on topics like object detection, bird surveys, and image processing, but it does not provide specific details about the deep learning model's hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
