The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention "Simple crop and resize data augmentation was used with the default settings of Caffe" in the description of the experiment. This suggests that some form of data augmentation was used, but it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of batch normalization, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer in a neural network. However, this is not a preprocessing step, but rather a technique used during training.

In general, preprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset being used. Common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular experiment.
