I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context discusses the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in modeling studies, specifically the NARX model, and its application in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping using remote sensing data. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the model.
