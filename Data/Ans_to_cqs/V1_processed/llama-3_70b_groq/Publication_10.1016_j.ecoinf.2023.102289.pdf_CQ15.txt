I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. It discusses the architecture of the model, the use of MXNet and GluonCV, and the semantic segmentation algorithm, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
