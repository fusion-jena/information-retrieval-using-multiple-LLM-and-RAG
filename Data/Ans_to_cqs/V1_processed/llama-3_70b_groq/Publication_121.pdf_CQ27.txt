The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model was to convert the saved models into the TensorFlow Lite version using the TensorFlow Lite converter. This is mentioned in the "App Development" section of the context. TensorFlow Lite is a set of tools to perform deep learning on smartphone and IoT devices. The converted models were then used in the mobile app developed using Android Studio and the Java programming language. The leaf detection module in the app contains a TensorFlow Lite interpreter for the TensorFlow Lite model.
