The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the number of variables used for each node (mtry) were automatically selected by using repeated cross validations performed with 10 folds and 10 repetitions for the seagrass meadow models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow models. This suggests that some form of cross-validation-based optimization was used, but the exact method (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
