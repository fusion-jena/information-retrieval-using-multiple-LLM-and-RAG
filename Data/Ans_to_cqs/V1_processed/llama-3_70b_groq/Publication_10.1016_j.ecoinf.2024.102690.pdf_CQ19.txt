The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context only mentions the use of the R package "kohonen" for implementing the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning neural network approach. It does not provide information about the deep learning frameworks used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
