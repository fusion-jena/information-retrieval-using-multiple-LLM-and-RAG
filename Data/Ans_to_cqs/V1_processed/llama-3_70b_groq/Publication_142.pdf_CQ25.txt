The purpose of the deep learning model in Pl@ntNet is classification. The model is trained to classify plant species based on images. It takes one to five images of a plant as input and returns a list of likely species with classification scores and matching images from the database. The model uses a CNN architecture, specifically the Inception model extended with batch normalization, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. The model's performance is strongly correlated to the quality and completeness of the training dataset, and it can only detect or recognize species that it has seen during training.
