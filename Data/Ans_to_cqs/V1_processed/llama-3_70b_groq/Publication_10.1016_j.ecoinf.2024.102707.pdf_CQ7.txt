Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context only provides the mean F1 scores obtained per dataset split, which includes training, validation, and test data, but it does not provide information on how the data was split.

However, it is common in machine learning to split data into training, validation, and test sets based on various criteria such as:

* Random sampling: dividing the data randomly into training, validation, and test sets
* Stratified sampling: dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes as in the original data
* Time-based splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets based on time, such as using older data for training and newer data for testing
* Location-based splitting: dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets based on location, such as using data from one location for training and data from another location for testing

Without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used to split the data in this particular study.
