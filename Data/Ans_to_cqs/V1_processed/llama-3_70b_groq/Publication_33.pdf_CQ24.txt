The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on a framework for controlling error rates in ecology using deep learning algorithms, particularly in the context of image classification for species identification.

The context discusses the use of a confidence threshold to convert the output of the neural network into a real probability, and the computation of species-specific thresholds using a training dataset independent from the one used to train the deep learning algorithms. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
