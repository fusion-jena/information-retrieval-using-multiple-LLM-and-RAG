I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) used for deployment. The context appears to be related to geostatistics, machine learning, and environmental data, but it does not provide information about the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
