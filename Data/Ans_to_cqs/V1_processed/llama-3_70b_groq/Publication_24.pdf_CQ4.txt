The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the application of different normalization strategies to improve network accuracy, but it does not specify any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
