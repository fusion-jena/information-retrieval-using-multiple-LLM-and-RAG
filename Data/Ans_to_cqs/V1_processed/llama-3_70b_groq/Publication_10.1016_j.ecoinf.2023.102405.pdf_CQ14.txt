I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It provides the architecture of the AODEGRU model, the training process, and the evaluation metrics, but it does not discuss hyperparameter tuning. It is possible that the authors used a specific method for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, but this information is not provided in the given context.
