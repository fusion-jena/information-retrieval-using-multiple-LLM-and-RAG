Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about model training or postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be discussing the acquisition and processing of forest fire area data using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and various datasets (MCD64A1, MCD12Q1, MOD17A3). It explains how to filter and extract data, calculate NPP, and store data in CSV format on Google Drive. There is no mention of model training or postprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
