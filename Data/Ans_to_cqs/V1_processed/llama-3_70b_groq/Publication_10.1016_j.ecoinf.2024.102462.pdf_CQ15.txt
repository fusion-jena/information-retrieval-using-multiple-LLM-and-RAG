Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text only mentions an "optimization process" in the context of adjusting the parameters of the model during training, but it does not provide further details on the specific techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
