I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, detection, or regression. The context focuses on the training process, hyperparameter optimization, and the comparison of different machine learning models (XGBoost and LightGBM) for a specific task, but it does not provide information about the task itself. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the purpose of the deep learning model based on the provided context.
