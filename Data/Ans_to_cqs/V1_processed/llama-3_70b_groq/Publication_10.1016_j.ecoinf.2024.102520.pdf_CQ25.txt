I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text discusses image acquisition and processing, remote sensing, and land use and land cover studies, but it does not mention a specific deep learning model or its application. The references cited are also unrelated to deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model based on the provided context.
