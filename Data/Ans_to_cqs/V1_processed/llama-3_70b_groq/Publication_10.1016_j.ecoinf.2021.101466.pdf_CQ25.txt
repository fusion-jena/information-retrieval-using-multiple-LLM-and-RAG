The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection and classification. Specifically, the model is used for insect candidate detection and classification. The model consists of two stages: the first stage uses YOLOv4 as a region proposal network to detect possible candidate regions, and the second stage uses the EfficientNet as a classifier to re-identify the detected candidates. The EfficientNet is trained as a classifier to classify the detected regions into different insect categories. The model's purpose is to accurately detect and classify insects in images, with the goal of achieving expert-level accuracy.
