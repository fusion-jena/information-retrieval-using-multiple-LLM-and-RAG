Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer and Adam optimizer were used, with learning rates ranging from 10^(-2) to 10^(-8). However, it does not specify whether a grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
