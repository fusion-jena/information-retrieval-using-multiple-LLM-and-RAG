The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically hierarchical classification of insects in a taxonomic hierarchy. The model is designed to classify input images into different levels of taxonomy, including species, family, order, and others. The model's output is a predicted class label at each level of the hierarchy, and it can also output "unsure" if the predicted class is not correct according to the higher rank in the taxonomic hierarchy.
