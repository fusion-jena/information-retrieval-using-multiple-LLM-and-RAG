According to the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are dropout and L2-regularization. Specifically, dropout is applied to the input of the last two layers with a probability of 0.5, and L2-regularization is applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001.
