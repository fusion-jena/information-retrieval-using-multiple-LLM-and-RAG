Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses model training, testing, and evaluation, but it does not provide specific information about how the data was split for these purposes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
