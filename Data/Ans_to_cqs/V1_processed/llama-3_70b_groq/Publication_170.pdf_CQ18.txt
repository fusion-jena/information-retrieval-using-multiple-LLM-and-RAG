The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the iteration termination condition, which is based on the loss rate of the model being less than a preset threshold ε (ε = 1.0 × 10^(-4)). This means that the model training stops when the loss rate reaches a certain level of accuracy, indicating that the model has converged. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error, which are defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) respectively. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance during training.
