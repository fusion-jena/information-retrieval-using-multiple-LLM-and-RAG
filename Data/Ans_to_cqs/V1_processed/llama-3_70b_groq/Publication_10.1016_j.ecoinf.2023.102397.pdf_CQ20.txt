I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The texts discuss various aspects of species distribution modeling, acoustic data analysis, and bird song recognition, but they do not provide information about the hardware used for training the models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
