The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the learning rate is set to 0.00005 and is optimized using the Adam optimizer. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are tuned or searched.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query, as the provided context does not provide sufficient information on the hyperparameter optimization method used (e.g., grid search, random search).
