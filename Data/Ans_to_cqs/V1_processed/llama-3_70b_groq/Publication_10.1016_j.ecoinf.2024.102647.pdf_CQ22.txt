The query asks about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, but the provided context does not mention deep learning models. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of machine learning models (Random Forest and CART) and statistical models (Frequency Ratio and Statistical Index) for predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps.

According to the context, the performance of machine learning models is evaluated using four criteria: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and correlation coefficient (COR). Additionally, the context mentions other performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, Kappa, and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC), which are used to validate statistical models.

Since the context does not provide information about deep learning models, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. However, I can suggest that the performance metrics used to evaluate deep learning models may be different from those mentioned in the context.
