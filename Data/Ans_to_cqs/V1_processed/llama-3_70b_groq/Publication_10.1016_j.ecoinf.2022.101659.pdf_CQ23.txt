I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The text appears to discuss valve gaping in shellfish, data analysis in R, and the potential for big data to improve predictions in aquaculture. There is no mention of deep learning or any specific machine learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
