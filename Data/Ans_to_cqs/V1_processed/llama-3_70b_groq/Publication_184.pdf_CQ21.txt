Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including data preparation, hyperparameter tuning, and model performance evaluation during training. It does not provide information on what happens after the model is trained, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
