I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It provides information about the Mask R-CNN model, its training process, and the system's compatibility with specific versions of TensorFlow, Keras, and Python. It also describes the data collection and annotation process, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
