I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on land use/land cover (LULC) classification, random forest classification, and spectral indices, but it does not provide information on deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
