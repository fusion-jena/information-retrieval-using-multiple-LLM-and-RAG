Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text discusses the training process, model architectures, and performance metrics, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for training. It is possible that the authors used a common criterion such as validation loss plateau, but this is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided information.
