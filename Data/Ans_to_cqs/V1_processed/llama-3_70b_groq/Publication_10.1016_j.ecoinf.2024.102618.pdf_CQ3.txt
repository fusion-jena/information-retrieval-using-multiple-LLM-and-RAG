I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on different deep learning models and architectures used for plant disease classification, as well as data augmentation techniques to increase the number of images in the dataset. However, it does not provide information on how the data was annotated or labeled in the first place. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
