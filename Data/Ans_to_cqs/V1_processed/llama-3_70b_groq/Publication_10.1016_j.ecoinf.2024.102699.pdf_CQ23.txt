The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to improve the generalizability of the models. Specifically, up to 19 well-established data augmentation techniques commonly used in audio classification were incorporated, and an iterative selection process was used to select only the augmentations that enhanced classification performance. This suggests that data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Additionally, the context mentions that the evaluated augmentation techniques consistently exhibited the same qualitative effects across all three deep learning models, which further supports the idea that data augmentation was used to improve generalizability. However, it does not provide information on other measures that may have been taken to ensure generalizability.
