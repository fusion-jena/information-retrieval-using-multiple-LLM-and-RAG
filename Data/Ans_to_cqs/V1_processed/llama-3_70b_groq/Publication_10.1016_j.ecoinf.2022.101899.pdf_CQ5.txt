The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context discusses wildfire event predictions in Australia, using deep learning technology, and analyzing environmental conditions before and after wildfires occurred. It also mentions the use of 97 images extracted from April 2013 to July 2021, and NDVI data was extracted from these images. However, it does not specify the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
