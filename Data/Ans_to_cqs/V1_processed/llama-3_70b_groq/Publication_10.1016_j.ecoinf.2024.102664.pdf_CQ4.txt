I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the structure of the CNN and LSTM models, the performance of different deep learning models, and the evaluation of algal bloom forecasts for the Zhoushan fishery. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques, so I cannot provide an answer to this query.
