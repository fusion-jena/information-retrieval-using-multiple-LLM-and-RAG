Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only discusses the performance of the EMViT-Net model and its comparison with other deep learning models, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
