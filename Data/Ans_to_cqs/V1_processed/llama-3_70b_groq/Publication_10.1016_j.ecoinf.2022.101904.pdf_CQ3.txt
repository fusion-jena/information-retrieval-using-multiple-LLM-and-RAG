Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of transformers in natural language processing and computer vision, particularly in remote sensing and wetland mapping. It discusses the advantages of transformers over CNNs and introduces a novel deep learning pipeline, 3DUNetGSFormer, for wetland mapping. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in this pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
