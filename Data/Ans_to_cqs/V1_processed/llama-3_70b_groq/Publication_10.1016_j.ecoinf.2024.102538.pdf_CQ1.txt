The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for bird acoustic recognition. It discusses various techniques to improve the performance of these models, such as incorporating long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, attention mechanisms, and hierarchical semantic embedding frameworks.

The context does provide information about the datasets used for training and testing these models, including BirdCLEF2018-Small, BirdCLEF2018-Large, Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata, and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata*. These datasets contain recordings of bird sounds, but the context does not specify how these recordings were collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query, as the provided context does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
