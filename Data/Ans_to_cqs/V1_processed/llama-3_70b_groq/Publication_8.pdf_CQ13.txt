The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Learning rate: 0.0025
* Momentum: 0.9

Additionally, the anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network (RPN) has the following hyperparameters:

* Anchor scales: [32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024] (square root of area in absolute pixels)
* Aspect ratios: [1:2, 1:1, 2:1]

The thresholds for non-maximum suppression (NMS) are:

* 0.6 for training
* 0.25 for testing
