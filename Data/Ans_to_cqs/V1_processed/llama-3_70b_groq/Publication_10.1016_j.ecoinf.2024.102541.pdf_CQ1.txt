Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline utilizes various methods for collecting raw data. Although the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, we can infer some possible methods from the mentioned applications and references.

One possible method is the use of satellite imagery, as mentioned in the reference "An automated deep learning based satellite imagery analysis for ecology management" (A.Y., Dec. 2021). This suggests that satellite images might be used as a source of raw data for deep learning models in ecology-related applications.

Another possible method is the use of sensors, as mentioned in the reference "AMBLoRa: a wireless tracking and sensor system using long range communication to monitor animal behavior" (Antoine-Santoni et al., 2018). This implies that sensor data might be used as a source of raw data for deep learning models in animal behavior monitoring applications.

Additionally, public datasets might be used as a source of raw data, as mentioned in the reference "Microsoft COCO: common objects in context" (Lin et al., May 2014). This is a well-known public dataset for object detection tasks, and it is possible that similar public datasets are used in other ecology-related applications.

It is also possible that surveys are used to collect raw data, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Surveys might be used to collect data on species distribution, population sizes, or other ecological metrics that can be used to train deep learning models.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline might include satellite imagery, sensor data, public datasets, and possibly surveys. However, more information is needed to confirm the specific methods used in each application.
