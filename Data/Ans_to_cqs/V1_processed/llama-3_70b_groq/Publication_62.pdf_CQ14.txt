Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context provides information about the author contributions, methodology, and architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image classification, but it does not discuss hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
