I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to species distribution models (SDMs) and correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces. It discusses various methods such as Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) for SDMs, but does not provide information on deep learning models or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
