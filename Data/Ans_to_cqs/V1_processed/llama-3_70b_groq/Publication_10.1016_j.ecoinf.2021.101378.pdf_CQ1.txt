Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline are primarily based on digital maps and geographic information systems (GIS). The dataset developed for the study consists of seven environmental variables, including geographical variables such as elevation, slope, and distance to road, as well as meteorological variables like annual mean temperature, minimum temperature in January, maximum temperature in July, and annual precipitation. These values were extracted from digital maps using the GIS program ArcGIS 10.1. Additionally, digital maps for elevation and slope were obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute of Korea.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in other studies or applications of deep learning pipelines.
