Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly LSTM neural networks, in carbon emission forecasting and their effectiveness in handling time-variable inputs. It also mentions the use of TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization. However, it does not provide information on the data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide sufficient information to determine the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
