Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline was collected through a survey method. Specifically, the dataset was created by selecting images of different individual insects from captured sequences of images during a period of observation. This is mentioned in the text: "The dataset was created by selecting images of different individual insects from the captured sequences of images in the period of observation."

Additionally, it is mentioned that the survey was conducted over three nights (30 August to 2 September 2019) from 22:30 to 05:00, resulting in a total of 22.5 hours of data collection. This suggests that the data was collected through a manual observation process, where images of moths were captured using cameras or other imaging devices.

There is no mention of sensors or public datasets being used for data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary method of data collection was through surveys and manual observation.
