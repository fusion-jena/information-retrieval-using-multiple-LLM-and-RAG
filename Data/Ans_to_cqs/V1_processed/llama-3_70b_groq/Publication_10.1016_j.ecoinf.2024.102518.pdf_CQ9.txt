I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The context appears to be related to species distribution models, habitat suitability, and ecological research, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository or a deep learning pipeline. The references cited are academic papers and datasets from sources like NASA and Google Earth Engine, but they do not mention a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
