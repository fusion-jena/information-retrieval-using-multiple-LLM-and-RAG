The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the creation of a confusion matrix to depict TensorFlow's initial results for Challenge 1. This suggests that the calculation of a confusion matrix is one of the postprocessing steps involved. Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of the correct identification rate, which is a metric used to evaluate the model's performance. However, it does not mention other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps. Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training are the calculation of the correct identification rate and the creation of a confusion matrix.
