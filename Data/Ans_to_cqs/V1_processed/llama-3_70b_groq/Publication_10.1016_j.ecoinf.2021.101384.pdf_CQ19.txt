I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the machine learning model for classifying fishing activity cells. The text only mentions that the vessel data are aggregated at 0.01 resolutions with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model, but it does not provide information about the framework used to build this model. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) was used.
