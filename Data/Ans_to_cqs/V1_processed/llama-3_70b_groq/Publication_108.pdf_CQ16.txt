The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions that the validation loss was consistently lower than the training loss before the overfitting point, but it does not specify how the overfitting point was determined or what criteria were used to stop the training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
