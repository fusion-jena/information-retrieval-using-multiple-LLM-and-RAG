Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The section 3.2 "Data pre-processing" is mentioned, but its content is not provided. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular study.

However, it is mentioned that the audio spectrograms are constrained to 128 Ã— 128 pixel RGB images with values repeated in each color channel to produce a greyscale image. This suggests that some form of data transformation or formatting is taking place, but the exact steps are not specified.

In general, common preprocessing steps in deep learning include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation, but without more information, I cannot confirm whether these steps were taken in this specific study.
