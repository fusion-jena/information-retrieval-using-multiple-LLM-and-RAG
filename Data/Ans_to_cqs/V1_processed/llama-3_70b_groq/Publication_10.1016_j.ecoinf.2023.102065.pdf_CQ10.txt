I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of CNN models, transfer learning, and the selection of recordings from the XC archive for pre-training, but it does not provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the code repository as it is not mentioned in the context.
