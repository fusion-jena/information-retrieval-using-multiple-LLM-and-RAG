Based on the provided context, the data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is random saturation adjustments to each training example. This augmentation strategy introduced variations in color intensity, contributing to a more comprehensive and robust training dataset. The number of outputs per example was increased to two as a result of this augmentation.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention other common data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques were applied in the pipeline.
