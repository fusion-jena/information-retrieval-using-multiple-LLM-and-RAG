I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The text appears to be a collection of references and a brief description of a study area, but it does not provide information about the specific model or its optimization process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
