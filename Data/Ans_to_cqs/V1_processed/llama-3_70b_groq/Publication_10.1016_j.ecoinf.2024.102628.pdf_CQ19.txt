The framework used to build the deep learning model is the fast.ai framework. This is mentioned in the context as "We utilized the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture which is a variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep learning tasks, particularly in computer vision... ResNet-34 was used inside the fast.ai framework (Howard and Gugger, 2020) to leverage existing knowledge, this is particularly useful in our dataset since its small size."
