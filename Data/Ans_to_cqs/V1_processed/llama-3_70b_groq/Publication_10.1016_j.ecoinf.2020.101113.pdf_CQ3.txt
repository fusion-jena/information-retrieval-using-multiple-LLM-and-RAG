The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the authors revalidated the annotations to account for errors, which accounted for only 1.2% of the total annotations. It does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
