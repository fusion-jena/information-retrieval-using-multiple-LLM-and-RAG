The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the training process, architecture, and hyperparameters of the diffusion model, as well as the feature extraction process for the MLP. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
