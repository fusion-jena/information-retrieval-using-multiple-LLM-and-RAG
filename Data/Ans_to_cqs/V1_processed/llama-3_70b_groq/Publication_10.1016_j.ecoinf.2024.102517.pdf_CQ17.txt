The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention batch normalization, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer, and can help with reducing overfitting. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU) as a non-linear operation, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting.
