Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is the reduction of the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation. This is mentioned in the section 2.3, where it is stated that model hyperparameters were tuned for each species-specific model using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the RMSE of the predictions. 

However, it does not explicitly mention a validation loss plateau as a criteria for determining when training is complete. It is possible that the training process stops when the RMSE reaches a certain threshold or when the improvement in RMSE is negligible, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
