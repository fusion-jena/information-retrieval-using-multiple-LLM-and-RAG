Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model selection process, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics for various machine learning models, including KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, and MLP. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is a common practice in machine learning to perform preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing or scaling the data, and removing outliers or noisy data. But, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular context.

In general, it is essential to perform preprocessing steps to prepare the data for model training, but the specific steps may vary depending on the dataset, model, and problem at hand.
