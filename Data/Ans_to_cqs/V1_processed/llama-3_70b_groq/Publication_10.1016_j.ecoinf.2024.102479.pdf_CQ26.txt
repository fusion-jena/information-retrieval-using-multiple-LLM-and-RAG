The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on biomass estimation using machine learning algorithms, and it discusses various algorithms such as random forest, gradient boosting, penalized regression, and ensemble models. It also provides information on hyperparameter tuning for these algorithms.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
