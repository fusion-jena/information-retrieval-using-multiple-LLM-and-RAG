According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the CNN-based models are: positive predictive value, sensitivity, and F1-measure. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in classifying and counting whales in images. 

The positive predictive value measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions made by the model. Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual whales that are correctly identified by the model. The F1-measure provides a balance between precision and sensitivity. 

Note that accuracy is not explicitly mentioned as one of the evaluation metrics in the provided context. However, it is possible that accuracy may be related to or implied by the other metrics mentioned, but without further information, it cannot be confirmed.
