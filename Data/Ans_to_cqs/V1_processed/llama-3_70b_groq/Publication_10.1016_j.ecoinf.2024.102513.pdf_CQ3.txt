The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the neural network architecture, pooling layers, attention mechanisms, and the integration of auxiliary data for improving the model's generalization capability. It also discusses the challenges of limited data availability for training deep neural networks in cases of sparse historical information. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
