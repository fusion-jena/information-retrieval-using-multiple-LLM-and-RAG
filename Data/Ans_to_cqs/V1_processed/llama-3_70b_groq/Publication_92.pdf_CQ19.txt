The provided context does not explicitly mention which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture of the network, which is based on GoogLeNet, and the use of convolutional layers, inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. It does not provide information about the specific framework used to implement the model, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
