The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques, which can help mitigate data bias to some extent. The context states that "the six data augmentation techniques mentioned before were applied for the remaining training and validation samples." Unfortunately, it does not specify what these six techniques are.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions random splitting of the complete sample set into 70% for training and 30% for validation, which can help reduce bias due to sampling. However, it does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
