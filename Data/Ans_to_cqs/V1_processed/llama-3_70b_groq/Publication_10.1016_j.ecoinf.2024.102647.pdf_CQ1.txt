Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land use, groundwater resources, and environmental studies, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

The context includes references to various studies and research papers, but it does not describe the data collection methods used in those studies. It also includes tables and lists of variables, such as land use types, climate types, and topographic features, but it does not indicate how the data for these variables was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
