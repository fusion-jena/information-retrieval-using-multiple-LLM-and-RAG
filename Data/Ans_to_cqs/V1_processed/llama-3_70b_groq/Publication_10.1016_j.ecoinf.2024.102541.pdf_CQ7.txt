Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to focus on various aspects of deep learning models, such as communication-efficient parallelization strategies, object detection models (e.g., SSD, YOLOv5), and evaluation metrics (e.g., IoU, EIoU). However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. The goal is to ensure that the training, testing, and validation sets are representative of the overall data distribution and that the model is not overfitting to a particular subset of the data.

Without more specific information, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
