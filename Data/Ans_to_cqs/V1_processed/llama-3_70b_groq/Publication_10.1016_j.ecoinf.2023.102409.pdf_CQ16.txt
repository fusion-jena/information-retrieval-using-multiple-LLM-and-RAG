Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the model's architecture, hyperparameters, and performance, as well as the application of the model in extracting fine-scale variations in vegetation across drylands. It does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
