The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of the model's performance using various methods such as k-fold cross-validation, random sampling, and blocked spatial sampling. It discusses the use of validation sets and test sets to estimate prediction error and assess the accuracy of the final model.

However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored during training using a validation set, which is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. This is a common approach in machine learning, as mentioned in the context. The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to prevent overfitting.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide explicit information on the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, the answer is based on the general understanding of machine learning practices and the information provided in the context.
