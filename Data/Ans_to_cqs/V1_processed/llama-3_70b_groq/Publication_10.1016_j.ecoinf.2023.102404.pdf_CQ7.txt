The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the tuning of parameters for a machine learning model, specifically a random forest model, and the use of stratified random sampling to split the data into training and testing sets. However, it does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.

The context mentions that the authors used a stratified random sampling approach to ensure that the training and testing datasets accurately represented the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. This approach was chosen to capture the full distribution of AGB values accurately. However, this information is specific to the random forest model and does not provide insight into the criteria used for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
