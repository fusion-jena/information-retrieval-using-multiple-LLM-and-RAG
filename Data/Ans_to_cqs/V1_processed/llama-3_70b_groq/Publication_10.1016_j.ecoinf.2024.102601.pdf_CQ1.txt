The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study utilizes S2 imagery as the source of data. This is mentioned in the context of optimizing data structures for ML classification, where the goal is to select the 12 most pertinent predictors from S2 imagery to enhance the model's performance. 

It can be assumed that the S2 imagery data is collected through satellite imaging, but the exact method of collection is not specified. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for data collection.
