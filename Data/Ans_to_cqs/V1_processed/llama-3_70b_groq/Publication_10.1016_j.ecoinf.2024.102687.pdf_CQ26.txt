The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on fine-tuning of pretrained CNN backbones and comparative analysis of CNN architectures for bird sound classification. It discusses the use of different CNN architectures, such as ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet, and their performance on the Darksound dataset. 

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
