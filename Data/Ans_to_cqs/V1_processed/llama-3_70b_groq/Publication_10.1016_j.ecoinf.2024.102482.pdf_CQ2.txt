Based on the provided context, it appears that various data formats are used in deep learning pipelines. 

From the references, it can be inferred that image data is used in some cases, such as in the study by Concepcion et al. (2023) where shell images are analyzed for geographical traceability of common cockle. 

Audio data is also used, as seen in the study by Padovese et al. (2023) where vocalization detection of the North Atlantic right whale is performed. Similarly, bird vocalization recognition is mentioned in Xie et al. (2023).

There is no explicit mention of video data being used in the provided context. However, it is possible that video data might be used in certain ecological applications, but it is not evident from the given references.

CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are commonly used for storing and exchanging tabular data, and it is likely that CSV files are used in some deep learning pipelines, especially when dealing with time-series data or sensor readings. However, there is no direct mention of CSV files in the provided context.

It is also possible that other data formats, such as text or graph data, might be used in deep learning pipelines, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, image and audio data formats are explicitly mentioned in the context, while CSV files are likely used but not directly mentioned. The use of other data formats, such as video, text, or graph data, is not explicitly stated.
