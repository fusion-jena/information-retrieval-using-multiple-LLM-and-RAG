The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various studies related to air quality, pollution, and their effects on health, with some mentions of machine learning models and their performance. 

However, it can be inferred that some studies might have used techniques to address data bias, but it is not explicitly stated. For instance, the study by Navares and Aznarte (2020) uses deep learning LSTM to predict air quality, but it does not mention any specific techniques to address data bias. Similarly, the study by Gokul et al. (2023) uses various machine learning models, including LSTM, to predict PM2.5 levels, but again, it does not mention any techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
