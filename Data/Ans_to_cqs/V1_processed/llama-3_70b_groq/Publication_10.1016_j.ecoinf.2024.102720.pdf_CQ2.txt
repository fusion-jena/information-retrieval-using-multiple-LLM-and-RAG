I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various research topics, including ecosystem service value, food supply and demand, environmental challenges, and teachers' self-efficacy, but it does not provide information about the data formats used in deep learning. The mention of deep learning is only in the context of strategic planning and as one of the models used for improved fusion, but it does not specify the data formats used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
