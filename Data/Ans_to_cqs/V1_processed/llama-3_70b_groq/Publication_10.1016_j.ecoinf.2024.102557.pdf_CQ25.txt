Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific purpose of a deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). However, it does mention various applications of machine learning in ecology, such as species distribution, species identification through imagery, characterization of land use change, identification of conservable or restorable areas, biodiversity conservation and estimation, and invasive species risk assessment.

From these applications, it can be inferred that deep learning models might be used for tasks such as image classification (e.g., species identification), object detection (e.g., detection of invasive species), or segmentation (e.g., land use change characterization). However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact purpose of a deep learning model.
