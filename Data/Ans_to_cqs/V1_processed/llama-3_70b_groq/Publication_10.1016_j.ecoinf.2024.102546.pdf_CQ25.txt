The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is primarily for weed detection and classification in agricultural settings. Specifically, the models are designed to identify and distinguish between different weed species in images, which can aid in precision farming and weed management.

The models mentioned, such as YOLOX and YOLOv8, are object detection models that aim to locate and classify weeds within images. The hyperparameter settings and loss functions used, such as BCE for classification loss and IoU for location loss, suggest that the models are optimized for detection and classification tasks.

Additionally, the context mentions datasets such as DeepWeeds and Weed25, which are specifically designed for weed species image classification and detection. The papers cited also discuss the application of deep learning models for weed detection and precision farming, further supporting the purpose of the models.

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning models is to enable accurate and efficient weed detection and classification, which can have significant implications for agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.
