The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on text classification tasks, data annotation, and sampling strategies for training and testing datasets. 

However, it does mention random selection of samples in certain scenarios, such as selecting a random sample of 50 texts to initialize the classifier, and using random selection as a strategy to select the next 50 texts to include in the training set (Figure 5). Additionally, the context discusses the use of stratified sampling to balance the representation of different topics in the training data.

It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
