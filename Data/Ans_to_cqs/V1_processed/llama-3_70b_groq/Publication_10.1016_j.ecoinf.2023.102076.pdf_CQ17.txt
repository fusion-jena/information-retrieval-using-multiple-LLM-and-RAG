The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of text classification, particularly with imbalanced datasets, and the use of hierarchical classification approaches and fine-tuning of pre-trained language models like BERT. It discusses the importance of sufficient training data and the potential of transformer-based models to achieve high-performing text classification. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
