I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses machine learning algorithms, their applications, and their performance in land use and land cover classification using remote sensing data. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques, which are typically used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of training datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
