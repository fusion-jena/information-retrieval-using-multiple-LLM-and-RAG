The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as R2, RMSE, MAE, and MBE during the validation phase. The K-fold cross-validation technique is used to divide the dataset into training and validation sets, and the model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set. The performance metrics are reported for both the training and validation phases, which suggests that the model performance is monitored during training using these metrics. However, the specific strategy or approach used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned.
