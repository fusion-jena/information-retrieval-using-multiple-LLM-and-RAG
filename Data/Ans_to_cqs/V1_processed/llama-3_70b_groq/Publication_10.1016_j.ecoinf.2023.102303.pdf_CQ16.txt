The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the application of deep learning methodologies to underwater fish video processing, compares the performance of semi-weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models, and mentions the trade-off between development time and accuracy. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau, convergence, or a specific accuracy threshold. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
