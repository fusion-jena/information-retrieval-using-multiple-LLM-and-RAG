The provided context does not mention specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs. The text focuses on the HyperBand algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and the training process, but it does not provide information about the underlying hardware infrastructure. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
