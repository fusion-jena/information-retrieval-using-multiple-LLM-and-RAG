Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is 70% for training and 30% for testing. There is no mention of a validation set. The text states: "The satellite images were split into 70% and 30% for training and testing, respectively." This suggests that the data was divided into two sets, one for training the model and one for testing its performance, but there is no mention of a separate validation set.
