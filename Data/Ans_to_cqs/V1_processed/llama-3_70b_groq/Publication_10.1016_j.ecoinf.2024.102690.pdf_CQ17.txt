The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) for identifying ecological sources, which is an unsupervised learning neural network approach. It explains how SOFM combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
