The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors used a validation set to evaluate the model's performance during training. This is evident from Table 1, which shows the sample sizes for the training, validation, and test groups. The use of a validation set suggests that the authors were monitoring the model's performance on unseen data during training to prevent overfitting and to select the best model. Additionally, the authors mention using backward stepwise selection to identify an effective model with fewer variables, which implies that they were evaluating the model's performance at each step of the selection process.
