I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to discuss valve gaping in shellfish, its relation to metabolic functions, and the potential for big data to improve predictions on productivity in aquaculture. It also cites several research papers on related topics. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or their hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
