Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context focuses on the application of deep learning in image processing, its advantages, and its achievements in various domains. It also discusses the proposed method's superior performance across a diverse range of environments, but it does not provide specific details on how this generalizability was achieved. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
