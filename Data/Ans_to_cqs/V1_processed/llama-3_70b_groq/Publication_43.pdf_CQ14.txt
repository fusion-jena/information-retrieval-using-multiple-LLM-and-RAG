The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the user has to manually optimize and initialize a set of non-dimensional parameters in the segmentation step, but it does not provide information on how these parameters are optimized. Additionally, the context mentions an update rule for the network weights (wt+1 = µwt − α∆J(wt)), but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters (µ and α) are optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
