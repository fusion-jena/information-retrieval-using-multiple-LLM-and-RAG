I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context discusses various topics such as the LSTM model, FMOP model, land use change, and ecosystem services, but it does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
