The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. It discusses the importance of including all observations in statistical modeling, implementing Bayesian algorithms, and evaluating the performance of software using real-world examples. However, it does not specify the metrics used to measure the performance of the model.

The context does mention "classification accuracy" as a metric, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
