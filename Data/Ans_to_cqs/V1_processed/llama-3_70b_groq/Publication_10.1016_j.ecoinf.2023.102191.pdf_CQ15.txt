I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, optimization techniques, or any specific algorithms such as SGD or Adam. The text appears to discuss a citizen science project that uses a mobile app to collect data on marine taxa, with a focus on usability, data quality, and the potential value of the app for the diving community. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
