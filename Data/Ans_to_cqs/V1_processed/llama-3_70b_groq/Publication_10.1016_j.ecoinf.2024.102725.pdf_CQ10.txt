I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and data related to NDVI reconstruction and vegetation cover studies, but it does not include any information about a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
