The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that the model is trained for 150 epochs, but it does not specify whether the training stops based on a certain condition, such as a validation loss plateau, or if it simply stops after the specified number of epochs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
