I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses various topics such as machine learning in Python, habitat suitability and spread patterns of an exotic invasive pasture grass, land use and land cover classification, hyperspectral remote sensing for invasive species detection, and deep learning for land use and land cover classification. However, it does not provide information on how a trained deep learning model was deployed, including model serialization and platform selection.
