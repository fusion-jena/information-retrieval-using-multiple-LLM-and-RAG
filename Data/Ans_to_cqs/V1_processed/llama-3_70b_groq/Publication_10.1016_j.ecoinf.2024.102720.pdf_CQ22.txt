I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis, which is a statistical technique used to analyze the relationships between variables. The metrics mentioned in the context, such as Ï‡2/df, GFI, RMSEA, RMR, CFI, NFI, TLI, and IFI, are used to evaluate the fit of the SEM model to the data, not to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.

The mention of "strategic planning based on deep learning algorithm" in the context is brief and does not provide any information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
