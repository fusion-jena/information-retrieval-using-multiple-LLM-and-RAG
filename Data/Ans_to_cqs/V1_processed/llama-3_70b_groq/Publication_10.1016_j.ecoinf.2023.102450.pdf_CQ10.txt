I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to deep learning and computer vision, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. The "Data availability" section mentions that data will be made available on request, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
