Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only discusses the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality data to select the most variable and representative scenarios for machine learning model training, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
