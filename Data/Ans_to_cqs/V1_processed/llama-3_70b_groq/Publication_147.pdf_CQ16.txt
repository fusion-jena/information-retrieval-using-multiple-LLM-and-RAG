The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the model was trained for 110 epochs, where each epoch was composed of 4800 training samples. It also mentions that a geometrically decaying learning rate was used. 

While this information does not directly answer the question, it suggests that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than based on a specific criterion such as a validation loss plateau. If more information about the training process was provided, it might be possible to infer the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
