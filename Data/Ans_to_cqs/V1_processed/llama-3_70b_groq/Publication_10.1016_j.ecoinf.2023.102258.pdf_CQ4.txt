I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. It mentions that "simple improvements over the baselines were achieved by applying data augmentation techniques", but it does not specify what those techniques are. Therefore, I cannot provide a list of data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
