Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references related to air quality, pollution, and environmental studies, along with some data that seems to be related to factory emissions. There is no mention of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numerical features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming numerical features to a common scale, such as standardization or feature scaling
* Feature selection: selecting a subset of relevant features to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance
* Data transformation: transforming data types, such as converting categorical variables to numerical variables

These preprocessing steps are essential to ensure that the model is trained on a clean and consistent dataset, which can improve its performance and accuracy. However, without explicit information, I cannot provide specific details on the preprocessing steps involved in the context provided.
