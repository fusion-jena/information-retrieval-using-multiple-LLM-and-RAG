The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the grid search focused on minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters. Additionally, it mentions that the maximum number of iterations and the maximum number of iterations with no improvement are hyperparameters that were explored in the grid search.

It can be inferred that the training is complete when the maximum number of iterations is reached or when there is no improvement in the MSE for a certain number of iterations. However, the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
