The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the comparison of Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) in species distribution modelling, and mentions other approaches like bootstrapping and spatial scale optimisation, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization methods such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
