The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on plant physiology, food safety, and agricultural monitoring, with mentions of statistical models such as linear models, generalized linear models, and artificial neural networks. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
