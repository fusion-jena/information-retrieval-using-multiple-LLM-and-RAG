The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in this context are R2, RMSE, rRMSE (%), and MAE. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the models in predicting canopy cover. R2 measures the goodness of fit, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) measures the average magnitude of the errors, rRMSE (%) is the relative RMSE, and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) measures the average difference between predicted and observed values. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall, which are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models.
