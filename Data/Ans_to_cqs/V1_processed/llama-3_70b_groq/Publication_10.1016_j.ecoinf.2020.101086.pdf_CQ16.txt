I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training completion criteria, such as validation loss plateau. The text appears to be discussing species distribution models, their performance, and the effects of sample size on their accuracy. It mentions various methods and their rankings based on different performance indices, but it does not touch on the topic of training completion criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
