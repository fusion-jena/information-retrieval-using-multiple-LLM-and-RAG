Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the performance comparison of the proposed EMViT-Net model with other deep learning models on the EMDS-6 dataset. It discusses the model's architecture, hyperparameters, and performance metrics but does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
