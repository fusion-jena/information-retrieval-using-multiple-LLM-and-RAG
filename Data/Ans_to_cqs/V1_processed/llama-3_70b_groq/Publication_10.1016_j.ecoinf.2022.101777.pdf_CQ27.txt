I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a research paper in Ecological Informatics, and it includes tables and figures showing direct flow measurements and simulations. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model, its deployment, or the process followed to deploy it. The context does not provide any information about model serialization, platform selection, or any other aspect of deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
