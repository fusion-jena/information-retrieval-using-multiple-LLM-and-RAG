Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text only mentions that "the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set has already improved by about 20% compared to the original CNN" after introducing the hybrid CNN-LSTM model. This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of metrics. Therefore, I don't know the complete set of metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
