I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the model's performance on different classes, the conversion of audio clips to spectrograms, and the segmentation of recordings into clips, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
