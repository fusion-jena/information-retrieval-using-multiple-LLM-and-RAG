I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only provides information about the training process, the optimizer used, the learning ratio, and the loss function. It also includes references to other research papers, but it does not provide a link or mention a specific repository where the code is available. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
