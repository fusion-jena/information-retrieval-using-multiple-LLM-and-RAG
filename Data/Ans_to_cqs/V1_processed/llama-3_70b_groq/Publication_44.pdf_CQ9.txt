Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture and training of the DeepLabv3+ model, the preprocessing of herbarium sheet images, and the training parameters, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
