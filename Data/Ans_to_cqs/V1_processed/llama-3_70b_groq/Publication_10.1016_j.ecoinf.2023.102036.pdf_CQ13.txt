The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

* Learning rate: 0.096
* Momentum: 0.845
* SD threshold: 0.05
* Input size: (200, 250, 3)

These hyperparameters were optimized during the training process, and the search intervals for each parameter are provided in Table 1. The learning rate, momentum, and SD threshold were searched in the intervals [0.05, 0.25], [0,1], and [0,1] respectively. The input size was searched in the set {(75, 125, 3), (100, 150, 3), (200, 250, 3)}.
