Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, vegetation change, and climate change, with formulas and equations describing the calculation of growing season NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) changes. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
