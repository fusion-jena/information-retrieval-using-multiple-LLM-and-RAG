The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the use of pre-trained CNN models (VGGish, BirdNET, and Wav2Vec 2.0) for feature extraction and classification of gibbon vocalizations. It does not provide information on the regularization techniques employed during the training of these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
