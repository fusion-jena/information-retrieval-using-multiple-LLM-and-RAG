Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through remote sensing technologies, specifically hyperspectral imagery. The context mentions the use of orbital hyperspectral data, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, and satellite imagery to collect data on water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a concentration, suspended sediment concentration, and phycocyanin.

Additionally, the context cites studies that utilize Landsat imagery and airborne hyperspectral imagery to estimate water quality characteristics. This suggests that the raw data is collected through remote sensing technologies that capture spectral reflectance data, which can then be used to train machine learning models to predict water quality parameters.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used to collect raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that other studies may utilize these methods to collect data, but it is not evident from the provided context.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as evident from the provided context, are primarily remote sensing technologies such as orbital hyperspectral data, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, and satellite imagery.
