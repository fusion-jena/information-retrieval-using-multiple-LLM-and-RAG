Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data, specifically high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey. The orthophotos are divided into small labeled tiles or image cubes of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, which are then fed into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
