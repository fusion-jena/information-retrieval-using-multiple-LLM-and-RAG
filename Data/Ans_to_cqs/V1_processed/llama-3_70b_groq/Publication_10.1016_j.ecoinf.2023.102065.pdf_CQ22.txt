The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision and recall. Specifically, the paper reports total precision and total recall at various probability thresholds (0.65 to 0.99) for the CNN-XC models and BirdNET. The total precision-recall curves are also provided in Fig. 5B. Additionally, the paper mentions that the BirdNET classifier with a geographic filter had sufficient total recall, which was set at 20% for the application.
