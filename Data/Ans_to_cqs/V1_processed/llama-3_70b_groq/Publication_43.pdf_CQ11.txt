I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the design of the training dataset, the CNN classifier, and the experimental evaluation, but it does not provide information about where the data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
