I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which involves setting parameters and controlling the complexity of queries. It also discusses filtering and ranking redescriptions based on accuracy, but it does not mention model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
