The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention feature normalization in the context of the backpropagation process. It states that feature normalization is suitable for identification tasks with poor image quality, but it is not suitable for the model presented in this work.

It can be inferred that feature normalization might be a preprocessing step in some deep learning models, but it is not a universal step for all models. The context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
