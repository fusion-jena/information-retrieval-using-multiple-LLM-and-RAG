I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various aspects of deep learning, attention mechanisms, and data augmentation, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
