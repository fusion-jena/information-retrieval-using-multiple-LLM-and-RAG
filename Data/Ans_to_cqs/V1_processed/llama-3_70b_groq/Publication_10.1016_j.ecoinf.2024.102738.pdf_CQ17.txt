I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification, remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS). It discusses topics such as dataset inputs, spectral bands, vegetation indices, and sampling strategies for classification. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, which are typically used in machine learning and neural networks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
