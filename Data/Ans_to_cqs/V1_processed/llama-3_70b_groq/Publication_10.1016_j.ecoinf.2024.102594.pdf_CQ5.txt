The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context only mentions "remote sensing images" and "semantic labels of land cover classes" as the input data, but it does not specify a particular dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It appears that the authors are working with a custom dataset of remote sensing images, possibly UAV or GF1 images, but the exact dataset name is not provided.
