Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of representative and sufficient training samples, and the need for feature optimization tools. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
