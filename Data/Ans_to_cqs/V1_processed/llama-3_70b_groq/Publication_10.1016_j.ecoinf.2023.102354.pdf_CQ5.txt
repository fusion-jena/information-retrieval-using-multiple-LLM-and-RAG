The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it lists a set of datasets related to groundwater-climate interactions, including:

1. TWS (Terrestrial Water Storage)
2. SMS (Soil Moisture Storage)
3. GWS (Groundwater Storage)
4. SPEI-3, 6, and 12 (Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index)
5. ENSO (El-Niño Southern Oscillation)
6. NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation)
7. AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation)
8. PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation)
9. IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole)
10. Niño 1 + 2, Niño 3.0, Niño 3.4, Niño 4
11. NTA (North Tropical Atlantic)
12. STA (South Tropical Atlantic)
13. ETA (Equatorial Atlantic)

These datasets are used for analyzing groundwater-climate interactions, drought characteristics, and hydrological risks, but they are not typical deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
