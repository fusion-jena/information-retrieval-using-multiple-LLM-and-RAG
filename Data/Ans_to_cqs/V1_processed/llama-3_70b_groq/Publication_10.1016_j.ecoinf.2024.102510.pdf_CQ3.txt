Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and part annotations. This is mentioned in the sentence: "Other studies followed the Fine-Grained Image Classification (FGIC) methods... and have used the Mask Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) and attention guided data augmentation to categorize the birds at a detailed level using bounding boxes and part annotations..."

However, it does not provide information on instance segmentation being used as a data annotation technique in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I can only confirm the use of bounding box annotation and part annotations, but not instance segmentation.
