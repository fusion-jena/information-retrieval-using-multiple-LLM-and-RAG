Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method mentioned is dive visual censuses performed by divers. This method involves divers conducting surveys to count fish in shallow habitats, typically focusing on hard-substrate habitats and ignoring mesophotic habitats and deeper ecosystems.

No other methods, such as sensors or public datasets, are explicitly mentioned in the context as means of collecting raw data. However, it is mentioned that dive surveys provide data at a slow rate, and the compilation of a global fish biodiversity database takes decades of efforts by multiple teams of highly skilled taxonomic divers.

It is possible that other methods may be used in conjunction with dive visual censuses, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
