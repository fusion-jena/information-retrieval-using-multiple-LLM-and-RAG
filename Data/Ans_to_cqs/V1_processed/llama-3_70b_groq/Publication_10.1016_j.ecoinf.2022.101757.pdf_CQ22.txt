The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, nor does it specify the metrics used to evaluate its performance. The context appears to be discussing the development of a metric for some application, and it mentions various metrics such as sample variance, R2, NSL, and absolute deviation. However, it does not mention traditional deep learning evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
