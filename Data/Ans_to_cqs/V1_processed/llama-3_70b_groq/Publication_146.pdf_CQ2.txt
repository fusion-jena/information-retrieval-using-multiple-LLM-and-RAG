Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically Sentinel-1 images. The images are cropped into 640x640 pixel tiles, and the objects of interest (icebergs and ships) are outlined as vectors in the images. The images are then converted into the darknet annotation format with text files containing information on the label class of objects and positions in the image. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
