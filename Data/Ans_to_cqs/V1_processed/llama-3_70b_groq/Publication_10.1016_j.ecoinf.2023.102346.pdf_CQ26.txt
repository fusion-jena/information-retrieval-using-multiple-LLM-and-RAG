The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning algorithms in microbiology and ecology, discussing the use of ensemble approaches, regression, and classification prediction tasks. It also mentions the evaluation of model performance using metrics such as AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR.

However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning to handle imbalanced datasets and reduce bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
