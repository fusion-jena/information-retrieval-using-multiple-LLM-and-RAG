Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized is acoustic tracking or monitoring of whale vocalizations. The context mentions "tracked vocalisations of each song structure" and "acoustic and visual localisations" which suggests that acoustic sensors or monitoring equipment are used to collect data on whale songs. Additionally, the mention of "baseline and monitoring surveys" implies that surveys may also be used to collect data. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of public datasets or other methods such as sensors. Therefore, the answer is limited to acoustic tracking/monitoring and surveys.
