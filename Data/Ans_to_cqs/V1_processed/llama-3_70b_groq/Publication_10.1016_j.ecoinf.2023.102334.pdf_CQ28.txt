I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It provides information about the machine configuration, experimental parameter settings, and model architectures, but it does not specify the deployment platform. The operating system mentioned is Ubuntu, but it is not clear if this is a local machine or a cloud-based instance. Therefore, I cannot determine the deployment platform from the given context.
