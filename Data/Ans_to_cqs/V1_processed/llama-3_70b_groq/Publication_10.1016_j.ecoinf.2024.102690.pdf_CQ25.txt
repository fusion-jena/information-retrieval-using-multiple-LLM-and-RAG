The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm, is to identify ecological sources and classify ecosystem functions according to a predefined setting. It combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities. The model is used for unsupervised learning, which means it doesn't require labeled data to train. The SOFM algorithm is applied to analyze the geographical variability and similarity of ecosystem services (ESs) and uncover the dominant service functions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological sources are located.
