I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization using the TPEBO algorithm, LSTM neural networks, and their application in carbon emission forecasting. It discusses the importance of hyperparameters, the TPEBO algorithm's approach to hyperparameter optimization, and the performance of LSTM models in carbon emission forecasting. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing or techniques used to address data bias.
