I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article or a paper that discusses the use of deep learning for air pollution analysis on carbon monoxide in Taiwan, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. The references cited in the article are other research papers and do not seem to be related to data repositories. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
