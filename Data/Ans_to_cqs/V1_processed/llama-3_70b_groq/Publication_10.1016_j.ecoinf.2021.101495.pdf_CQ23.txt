Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation was used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Specifically, the model was trained on a dataset with 14,896 images, and data augmentation was applied to increase the size of the dataset by a factor of 12. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse set of images, which can help improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on 22 out of 30 fishing sets, which were unannotated. This implies that the model was trained on a diverse set of data from different fishing sets.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

In summary, data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the training dataset, but it is unclear whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
