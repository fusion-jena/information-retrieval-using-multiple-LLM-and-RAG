The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the training data collection pipeline could accelerate the collection of data for rare species, and that public datasets, such as the Xeno-Canto dataset, are often used in large-scale species recognition efforts. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected for the specific study mentioned. It is possible that the study uses a combination of methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
