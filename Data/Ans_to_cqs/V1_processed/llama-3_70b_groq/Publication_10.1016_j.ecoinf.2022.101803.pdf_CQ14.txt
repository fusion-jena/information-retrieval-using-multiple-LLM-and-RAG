According to the provided context, the hyperparameter λ (regularization parameter) is optimized by repeating the iterative optimization of the objective function in Eq. (16) for 100 discrete candidate values of λ chosen from a vector of equidistant values. Then, the value that minimizes the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is selected. This approach can be considered as a form of grid search, where the hyperparameter space is discretized and the objective function is evaluated at each point in the grid. The point that results in the best performance (in this case, the lowest BIC) is chosen as the optimal hyperparameter value.
