The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The text focuses on active learning, input selection, and the application of models for detecting rare events, but it does not delve into the specifics of postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention "post-processing of results" in section 4.7, but it does not provide further details on what these steps entail. It is possible that the authors assume the reader is familiar with common postprocessing steps in machine learning, but without additional information, it is difficult to determine the exact steps involved.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
