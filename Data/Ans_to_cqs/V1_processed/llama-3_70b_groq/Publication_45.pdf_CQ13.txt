The context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate. However, it does mention that the hyper-parameters evaluated iteratively were network capacity (number of layers and neurons per layer), applied regularization techniques, as well as the used loss function and optimizer. 

It does not provide specific details about the learning rate, but it mentions that the training of the individual candidate networks was stopped when the accuracy of the network on the test dataset did not increase further. 

Additionally, the context mentions that all experiments and predictions were conducted using the TensorFlow framework, but it does not provide specific details about the optimizer used.
