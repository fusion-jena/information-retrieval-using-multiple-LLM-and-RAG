I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be discussing biodiversity data repositories, such as GBIF and OBIS, and the analysis of species occurrence data. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
