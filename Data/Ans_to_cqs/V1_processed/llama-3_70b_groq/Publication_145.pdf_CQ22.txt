According to the provided context, two performance metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: overall accuracy and F1 score. The overall accuracy is computed as the percentage of correctly classified pixels. The F1 score is computed for each class as the harmonic average of precision and recall. The precision is the ratio of the number of segments classified correctly as a particular class to the number of all segments (true and false positive), and the recall is the ratio of the number of segments classified correctly as a particular class to the total number of segments belonging to that class (true positive and false negative).
