The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyperparameter setting was completed based on studies that successfully implemented Yolo in remote sensing cases, and that the default parameters of YoloV3 were used, which are 0.001, 0.9, and 0.0005 for the learning rate, momentum, and weight decay, respectively. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other hyperparameter optimization method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
