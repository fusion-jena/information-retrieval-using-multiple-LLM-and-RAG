The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model. The context discusses the performance evaluation of models such as XGBoost, SVR, and RF, but it does not mention deep learning models. The evaluation metrics mentioned in the context are R-squared, RMAE (Relative Mean Absolute Error), and RRMSE (Relative Root Mean Squared Error), which are used to evaluate the performance of the RF model. 

It does not provide information about the evaluation metrics for deep learning models. If you are looking for common evaluation metrics for deep learning models, they typically include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc. However, this information is not provided in the given context.
