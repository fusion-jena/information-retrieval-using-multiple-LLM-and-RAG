Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error and provides the parameter settings of the MLP model in Table 2, but the table is not provided in the context. Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
