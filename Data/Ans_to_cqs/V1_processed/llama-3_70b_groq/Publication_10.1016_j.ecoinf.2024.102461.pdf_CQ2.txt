Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically satellite images. The context mentions the use of Landsat 8 satellite images, Sentinel 2 satellite images, and UAV images, which suggests that image data is being used. Additionally, the context discusses the use of various vegetation indices and machine learning techniques, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, to analyze and process the image data. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV files may be used to store and manage the metadata associated with the image data, such as the acquisition dates, cloud cover, and spatial resolution.
