I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the training dataset, hyperparameter optimization, and the performance of different machine learning models such as XGBoost and LightGBM, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
