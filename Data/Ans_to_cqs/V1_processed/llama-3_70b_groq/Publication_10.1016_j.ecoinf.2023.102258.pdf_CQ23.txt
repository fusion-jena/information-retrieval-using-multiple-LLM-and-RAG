Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the different approaches and techniques used by various systems submitted to the public challenge, such as the use of Mel spectrograms with PCEN, CNN architectures, and meta-learning with prototypical networks or fine-tuning using cross-entropy.

However, it can be inferred that the challenge itself might have been designed to test the generalizability of the models across different datasets and tasks. The context mentions that the aim is to generalize over a range of loosely-related datasets/tasks, which is a common interest in machine learning. Additionally, the evaluation set results are presented by class, suggesting that the challenge might have used a diverse dataset to evaluate the models.

Despite this, the context does not provide explicit information on whether cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques were used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
