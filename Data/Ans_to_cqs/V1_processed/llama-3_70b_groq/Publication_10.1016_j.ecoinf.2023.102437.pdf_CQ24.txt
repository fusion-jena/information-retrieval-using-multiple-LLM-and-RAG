Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and random forest (RF) models, as well as their applications in environmental science and ENSO forecasting. 

However, in general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves techniques such as:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting.
3. Implementing regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, to prevent model complexity.
4. Using ensemble methods, like bagging and boosting, to combine multiple models and reduce variability.
5. Performing cross-validation to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

These strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but they are common practices in deep learning to handle randomness and ensure model robustness.
