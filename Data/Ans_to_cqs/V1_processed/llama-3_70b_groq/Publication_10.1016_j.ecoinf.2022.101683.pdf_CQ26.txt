The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing invasive Species Distribution Models (iSDM) and methods to address sampling bias in presence-only data.

However, it does mention three methods to reduce sampling bias: i) weighted background points, ii) filtered (pre-thinned) records, and iii) targeted background points. Additionally, it discusses spatial filtering of input data as a method to control potential spatial autocorrelation bias prior to model building.

It does not mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
