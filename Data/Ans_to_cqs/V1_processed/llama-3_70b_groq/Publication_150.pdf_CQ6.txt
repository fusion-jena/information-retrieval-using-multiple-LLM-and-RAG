The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of batch normalization in the training process. Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer in a neural network, which can help stabilize the training process and improve the model's performance.

Other than batch normalization, the context does not provide information about other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation. It does mention the importance of further developing the training dataset to enhance generalization and model accuracy, but it does not specify the preprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is batch normalization. Other preprocessing steps may have been involved, but they are not mentioned in the context.
