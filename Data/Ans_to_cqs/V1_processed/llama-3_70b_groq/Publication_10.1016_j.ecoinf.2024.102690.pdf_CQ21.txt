I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to ecological corridors, species migration, and habitat maintenance, but it does not mention model training or postprocessing steps. The text discusses scenarios, ecological barriers, and disturbance points, but it does not provide information about saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices, which are typically used in machine learning and deep learning contexts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
