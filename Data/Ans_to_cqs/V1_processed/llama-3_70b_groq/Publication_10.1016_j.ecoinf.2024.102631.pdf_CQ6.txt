The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It describes the architecture of the network, including the input dimensions, convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation functions. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular model. It is possible that the input images were preprocessed in some way, but the context does not provide enough information to determine what those steps might be.
