The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of dropout in the model training process, with a dropout rate of 0.001. This suggests that dropout is one of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. 

Other regularization methods, such as L2 regularization, are not mentioned in the provided context. It is possible that other regularization methods may have been used, but this information is not available in the provided context.
