I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies with satellite data interpretation for aquatic environmental monitoring, but it does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
