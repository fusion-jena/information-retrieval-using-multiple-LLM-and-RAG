I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, machine learning, and statistical analysis, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
