Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of various models, including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5s, and the proposed method, but it does not provide information on the dataset or training procedures used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
