The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is primarily object detection and segmentation, specifically for underwater fish detection and segmentation tasks. The models, such as YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and the improved VOS model, are designed to detect and segment fish in images or videos. The goal is to accurately identify and locate fish in underwater environments, which can be useful for applications such as monitoring fish populations, tracking fish behavior, and managing fisheries.

The models are evaluated based on their performance in object detection and segmentation, with metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) being used to assess their effectiveness. The context also mentions the use of deep learning for other applications, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and image processing, but the primary focus is on object detection and segmentation for underwater fish detection.
