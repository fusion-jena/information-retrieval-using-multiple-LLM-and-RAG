Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in wildfire event predictions in Australia, discussing various approaches and methodologies used in different studies. It does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
