Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecological forecasting and forest disturbance, and it does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of splitting the available data into a training data set and a test data set to gauge the accuracy of predictions for new input data. This implies that data splitting is an important consideration in the deep learning pipeline, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
