Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep-learning methods for classification in entomology, the importance of large training datasets, and the performance of different models on the TLm dataset. It also mentions the use of transfer learning and pre-trained weights from ImageNet, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
