I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a dataset for earth system science, discussing variables such as soil moisture, precipitation, air temperature, and radiation, as well as machine learning models like KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, and MLP. It also mentions hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and cross-validation. However, there is no mention of data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used in computer vision tasks.
