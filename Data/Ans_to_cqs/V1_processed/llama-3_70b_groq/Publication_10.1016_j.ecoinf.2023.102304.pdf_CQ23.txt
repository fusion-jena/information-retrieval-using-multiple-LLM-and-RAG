Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the optimization of the LTR model, the use of XGBoost and Random Forest, and the importance of feature selection, but it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
