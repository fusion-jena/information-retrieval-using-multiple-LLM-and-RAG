The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F-score. 

Precision is calculated as TP / (TP + FP), where TP is the number of true positives and FP is the number of false positives. Recall is calculated as TP / (TP + FN), where FN is the number of false negatives. The F-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as 2 × Precision × Recall / (Precision + Recall). 

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's ability to correctly identify Pacific oysters in images. The confidence intervals for precision and recall are also calculated to provide an estimate of the uncertainty of the model's performance.
