Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of the models using metrics such as precision, recall, F-score, and confidence intervals, but it does not provide information on the training process or how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
