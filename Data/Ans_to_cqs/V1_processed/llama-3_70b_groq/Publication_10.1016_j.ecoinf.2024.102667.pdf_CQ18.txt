I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a research study on vegetation change, climate change, and human activities, with a focus on China. The text includes mathematical equations, references to academic papers, and discussions of land use/cover types, GSN changes, and contribution rates. However, there is no mention of a model or its performance during training, nor is there any information about a strategy for monitoring model performance. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
