The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that 80% of the data was used as the training set, and the remaining 20% (the evaluation set) was used to assess model performance. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated using the evaluation set, but the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the performance during training are not mentioned.
