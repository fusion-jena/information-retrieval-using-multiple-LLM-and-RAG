The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention "Confusion matrix analysis of proposed models with state-of-art models" in section 4.3, which suggests that a confusion matrix is calculated as part of the postprocessing steps.

Beyond that, the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or metrics calculation. It primarily focuses on the model training process and data pre-processing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that confusion matrix analysis is one of the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. I do not have enough information to determine if saliency maps or metrics calculation are part of the postprocessing steps.
