I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling using an ensemble approach with four different models (regression-based, MaxEnt, RF, and SVM) in the BIOMOD2 package in R. It discusses model performance evaluation using cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as an accuracy metric. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
