Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the comparison of different classification models, feature extraction model selection, and semi-supervised learning techniques, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
