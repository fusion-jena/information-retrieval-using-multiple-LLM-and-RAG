The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the model preparation, training, and evaluation steps, but it does not provide information on model deployment. 

The context mentions the use of PyTorch, scikit-learn, and skorch libraries for building and training the models, but it does not discuss how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
