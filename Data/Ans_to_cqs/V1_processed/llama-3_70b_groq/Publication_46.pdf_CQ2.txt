Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly mentioned what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in species distribution modeling (SDM) and mentions the use of satellite-based observations, but it does not specify the data formats used.

However, it can be inferred that the data formats used might be related to remote sensing and satellite imagery, as the study is conducted in the Himalayas and uses satellite-based observations. This could potentially involve image data formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG, or PNG. However, this is only an educated guess, and the exact data formats used are not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and more information would be needed to determine the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
