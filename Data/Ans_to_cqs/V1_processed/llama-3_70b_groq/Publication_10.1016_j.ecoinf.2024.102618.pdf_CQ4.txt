According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Flipping
2. Cropping
3. Shifting
4. Rotation
5. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
6. Color augmentation
7. Noise augmentation
8. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

These techniques are used to enhance the diversity of the data without the need to attach or add a new dataset to the training process. The experiments conducted in the research prove that the performance of four augmentation techniques (cropping, flipping, GANs, and rotation) is better than the other augmentation methods.
