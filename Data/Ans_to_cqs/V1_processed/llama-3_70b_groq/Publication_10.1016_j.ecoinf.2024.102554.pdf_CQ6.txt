Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to data acquisition and retrieval from various sources, including ESA and NASA, and storing the data in NetCDF files. It also mentions the importance of early intervention to reduce pollutant entry into a lagoon, but it does not provide information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
