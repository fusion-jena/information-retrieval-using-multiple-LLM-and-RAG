The purpose of the deep learning model in LaDeco is semantic segmentation. This is stated in section A.1.2, which mentions that the deeplabv3 part of the model is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google. Additionally, section 3.2.2 provides a detailed explanation of semantic segmentation, describing it as a technology used in image recognition that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image. This aligns with the functionality of LaDeco, which calculates the pixel percentage of each landscape element in an image.
