Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of hyperparameters, model architecture, and accuracy assessment.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained and validated using separate datasets, as the context mentions "validation dataset" in multiple instances. This suggests that the model was evaluated on unseen data during the training process, which is a common practice to ensure generalizability. Nevertheless, the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not explicitly stated.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
