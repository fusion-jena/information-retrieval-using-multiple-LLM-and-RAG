The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the fine-tuning process, the Semi-Automatic Loop (SAL), and the human verification step, but it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
