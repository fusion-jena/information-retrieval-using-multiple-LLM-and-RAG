The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It only discusses the architecture of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and the use of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for predictor variable selection. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which framework was used to build the deep learning model.
