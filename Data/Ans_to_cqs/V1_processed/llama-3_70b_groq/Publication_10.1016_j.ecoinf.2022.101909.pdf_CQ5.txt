The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are ImageNet, Audio Set, and VGG-Sound. ImageNet is a popular dataset used for pre-training, and it has been applied to the bioacoustic domain by other authors. Audio Set and VGG-Sound are alternative datasets that can be used for pre-training, and they have been shown to be just as effective as ImageNet. Additionally, synthetic clicks or chirps can also be used for pre-training. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR in the provided context.
