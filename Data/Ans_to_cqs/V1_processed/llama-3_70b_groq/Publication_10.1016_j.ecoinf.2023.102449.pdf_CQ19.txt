The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the encoder and decoder, which are deep CNNs set up as wide residual networks, and provides details about the layers and operations used in the model. However, it does not mention the framework used to implement the model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
