The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on audio data augmentation techniques for birdsong classification, including methods like pitch shifting, time stretching, mix-up, and Gaussian noise. It also discusses the preprocessing of audio data, including the use of weakly labeled recordings and the addition of background noise. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
