The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the application of deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to biological problems involving image classification and information extraction. It also touches on the importance of validation data in preventing overfitting during model training.

However, it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to mitigate data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
