Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model selection procedure, data partitioning, and the overall workflow of the 'autoML' workflow in mcfly. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that may be performed after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
