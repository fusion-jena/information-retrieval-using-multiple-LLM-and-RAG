Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the feature extraction and classification workflows, as well as the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) for signal classification. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
