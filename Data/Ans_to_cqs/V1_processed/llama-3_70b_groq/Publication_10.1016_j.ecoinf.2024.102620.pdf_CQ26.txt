Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study involving ecological informatics, and it discusses data sources, spatial resolution, and resampling of data. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
