The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly mentioned in the text, where it is stated that "Training the CNN took approximately 18 h to complete the 6000 iterations." Additionally, the authors cite a paper by Krizhevsky et al. (2012) on "Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks", which further supports the use of a CNN in the pipeline.
