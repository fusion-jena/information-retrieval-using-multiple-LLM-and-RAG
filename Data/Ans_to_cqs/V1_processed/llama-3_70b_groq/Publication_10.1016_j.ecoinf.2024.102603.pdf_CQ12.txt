I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model being used in the pipeline. In fact, the text contrasts XGBoost with deep learning models in general, highlighting their differences in terms of computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. However, it does not specify a particular type of deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
