I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, and others, but it does not provide information on deep learning or how to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning, and no further information is provided on this topic. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
