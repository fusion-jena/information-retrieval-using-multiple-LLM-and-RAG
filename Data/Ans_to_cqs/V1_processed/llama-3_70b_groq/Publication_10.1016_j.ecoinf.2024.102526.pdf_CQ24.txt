I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on the planning and execution of marine imaging projects, including the collection and annotation of images, and the use of artificial intelligence for detecting and identifying organisms in those images. While it mentions the potential for bias in AI tools due to the definition of the target population used in image capture, it does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
