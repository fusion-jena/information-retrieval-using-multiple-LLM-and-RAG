I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing the development of neural networks, including Bayesian learning machines and deep learning, as well as their applications in various fields such as forest vegetation mapping, global climate change, and ecological research. It also provides some mathematical formulations for neural networks, but it does not mention specific datasets used for training or testing these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
