The context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the description of the data pre-processing step, it can be inferred that the data is in the form of images or raster data, as it is split into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels. Additionally, the post-processing step involves converting the raster representation into a vector representation, which suggests that the output of the CNN is a raster image or a grid-like data structure. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely to be image or raster data, but the exact format (e.g., JPEG, TIFF, GeoTIFF) is not specified.
