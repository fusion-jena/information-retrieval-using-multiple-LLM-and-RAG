I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to research papers and articles on image classification and object detection for pest species, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. The references provided are mostly links to research papers and articles, but not to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
