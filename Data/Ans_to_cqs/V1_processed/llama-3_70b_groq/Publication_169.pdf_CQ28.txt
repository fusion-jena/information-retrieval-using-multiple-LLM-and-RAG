I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the system requirements and specifications used to implement the CNN-LSTM model, such as the central processing unit (CPU), operating system (OS), random access memory (RAM), and system architecture. It also mentions the use of Python libraries, Theano, and Keras, but does not provide information about the deployment platform.
