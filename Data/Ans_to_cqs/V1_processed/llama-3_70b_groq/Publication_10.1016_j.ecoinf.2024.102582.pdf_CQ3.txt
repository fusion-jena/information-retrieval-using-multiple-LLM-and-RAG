I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to mangrove forest research, remote sensing, and land use/cover change analysis, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
