Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the modeling approaches used in the examined articles, the types of models implemented, and the results of the models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
