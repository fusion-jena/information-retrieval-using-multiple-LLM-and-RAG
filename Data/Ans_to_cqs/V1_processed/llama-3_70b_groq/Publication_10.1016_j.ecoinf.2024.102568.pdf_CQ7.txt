Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, model architecture, and performance evaluation of the LSTM model. It discusses the preprocessing of the training set using a MinMaxScaler, the selection of the temporal window dimension, and the performance comparison with the VR + SVR model. However, it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
