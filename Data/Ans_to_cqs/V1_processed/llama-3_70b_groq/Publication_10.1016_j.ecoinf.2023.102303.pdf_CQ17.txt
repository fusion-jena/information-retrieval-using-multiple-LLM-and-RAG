The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of deep learning methodologies to underwater fish video processing techniques in turbid waters, and discusses the use of weakly-supervised DNN ensemble and semi-supervised contrastive learning approaches. It does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
