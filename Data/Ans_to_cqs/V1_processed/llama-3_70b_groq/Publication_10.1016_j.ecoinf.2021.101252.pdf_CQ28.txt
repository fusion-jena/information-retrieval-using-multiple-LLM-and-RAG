I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the challenges of computational demand in deep learning, the need for faster hardware and scalable model implementations, and the use of AutoML procedures to automate the model selection process. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
