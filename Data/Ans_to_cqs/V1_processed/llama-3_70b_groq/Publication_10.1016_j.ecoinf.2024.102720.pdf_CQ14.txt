I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article that discusses a structural equation model (SEM) and its application to a specific problem, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. The tables and equations presented in the context are related to the SEM model's fitness indices, path coefficients, and variable selection, but they do not mention hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
