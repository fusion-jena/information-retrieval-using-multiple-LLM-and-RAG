Based on the provided context, it appears that citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, and questionnaires are utilized for collecting raw data. Additionally, scuba divers are mentioned as contributors to marine citizen science initiatives, suggesting that they may be involved in data collection as well.

There is no mention of sensors or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that joint research efforts and improved scientific data sharing can help to cost- and time-effectively obtain and analyze a large amount of solid information on species occurrences.

It's worth noting that the context does not specifically mention a deep learning pipeline, so it's unclear if these methods are being used for that purpose.
