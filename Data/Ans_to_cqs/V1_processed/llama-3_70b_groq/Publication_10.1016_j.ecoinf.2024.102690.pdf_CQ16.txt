I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are terms commonly used in machine learning. The context appears to be related to ecological corridors, land-use types, and recreational culture, with no mention of machine learning or training criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
