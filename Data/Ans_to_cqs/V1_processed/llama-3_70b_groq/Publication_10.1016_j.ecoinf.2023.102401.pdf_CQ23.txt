To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset, specifically the URPC dataset, which consists of 1201 images with four object categories: holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish. The training dataset was further divided into training and test sets following an 8:2 ratio, which allows for a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm's performance.

Additionally, the model was tested on five additional datasets, including Aquarium, Trash-ICRA19, VisDrone, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID, to evaluate its generalization capabilities. These datasets are diverse in terms of their categories, with some being part of the Marine Dataset, comprising marine animals and waste categories.

Data augmentation techniques were also employed to introduce diversity into the training dataset. The hyperparameters used for data augmentation are specified in Table 2, which includes the ranges and probabilities for each augmentation technique. This helps the model learn robust features and improve its performance in real-world scenarios.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
