I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the training process, including data normalization and standardization, batch size, optimizer, learning ratio, and loss function. It also provides references to various papers and conferences, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
