The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to earth system science and mentions variables such as soil moisture, precipitation, air temperature, and radiative properties, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
