I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, nor does it discuss the use of random seed values. The context primarily compares XGBoost and deep learning models in terms of their interpretability, performance on small datasets, and computational requirements. It also mentions the use of deep learning models for extracting vegetation indices from structured and unstructured data. However, it does not provide information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
