Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ and the sequential approach used to train the model on the Vasiliko dataset. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
