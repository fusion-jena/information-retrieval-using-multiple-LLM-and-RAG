Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a mixture of Unicode characters, mathematical notation, and some English text, but it does not provide a clear answer to the query.

The text mentions "Authorized licensed use limited to: Thueringer Universitaets" and "Downloaded on November 16,2023 at 09:49:35 UTC from IEEE Xplore", which suggests that the context might be related to an academic paper or research article. However, the content of the paper is not clear, and it does not provide information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
