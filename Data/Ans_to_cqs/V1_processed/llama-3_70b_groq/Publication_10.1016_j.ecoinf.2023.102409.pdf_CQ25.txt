The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context, such as Unet, Pspnet, and DeepLabV3+, is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the description of the models and their applications in the context. For instance, the Unet model is described as exhibiting proficiency in achieving more accurate results by requiring a smaller number of training samples, which is a characteristic of semantic segmentation tasks. Similarly, the DeepLabV3+ model is described as integrating an asymmetric spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) architecture within an encoder-decoder framework, which is a common approach in semantic segmentation tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the application of these models in geographical and ecological challenges, which further supports the notion that the purpose of these models is semantic segmentation.
