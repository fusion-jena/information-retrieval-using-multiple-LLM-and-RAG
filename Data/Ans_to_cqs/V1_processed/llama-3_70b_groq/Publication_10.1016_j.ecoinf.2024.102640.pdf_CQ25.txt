The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically SegFormer, is semantic segmentation. This is stated in the context as "a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation" and "to complete GVI learning" where GVI stands for Green Vegetation Index. The model is used to measure photo GVI, which involves segmenting images into different categories, such as green vegetation, to quantify the amount of greenery in urban areas.
