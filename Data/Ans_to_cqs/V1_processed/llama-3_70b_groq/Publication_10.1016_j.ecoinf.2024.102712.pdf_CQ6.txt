Based on the provided context, it appears that the preprocessing step involved is a simple atmospheric correction using the Dark Object Subtraction 1 (DOS1) method. This is mentioned in the context as part of the processing step. However, it does not explicitly mention other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are typically involved before training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know if any other preprocessing steps are involved, as the context does not provide that information. The context only mentions the atmospheric correction step, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps.
