Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only mentions that data augmentation can be used to enhance the dataset and improve the classification accuracy of CNN models, citing a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019). However, it does not provide details on the specific techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
