The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the database construction phase, training phase, classification phase, and validation phase, but it does not provide information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions data augmentation as a technique used to improve the performance of the CNN-based models. Data augmentation is a preprocessing step that involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing images, such as rotation, flipping, and cropping. This technique can help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.

Other than data augmentation, the context does not provide information about other preprocessing steps. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
