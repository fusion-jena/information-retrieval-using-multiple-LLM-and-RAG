According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows:

The annotated dataset AnnotationsActions is split randomly (but fixed for all experiments and all networks) into a train set, validation set, and test set. The test set includes 20% of the video clips of each class. Of the remaining clips, again 20% of the clips in each class form the validation set. The remaining clips are the training set.

In other words, the data is split into three sets: test set (20% of each class), validation set (20% of each class from the remaining clips), and training set (the remaining clips). This split is done randomly but is fixed across all experiments and networks.
