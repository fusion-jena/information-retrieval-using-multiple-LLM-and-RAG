The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN backbone for improving clustering quality and discusses the importance of fine-tuning the model for achieving better results. It also compares the performance of different CNN backbones and discusses the energy consumption during training. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
