Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image and multispectral data. Specifically, the papers mention the use of:

* Hyperspectral image data (De Lucia et al., 2022)
* Multispectral data from Landsat 8 (Dube and Mutanga, 2015)
* Sentinel-2 spectral data (Mngadi et al., 2021a)
* Sentinel-1 and 2 imagery (Mngadi et al., 2021b)
* PolSAR image data (Memon et al., 2019)

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, while CSV files may be used to store and process data, there is no explicit mention of CSV files being used as a data format in the pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context primarily focuses on remote sensing and image classification applications, which is why image and multispectral data formats are prominent.
