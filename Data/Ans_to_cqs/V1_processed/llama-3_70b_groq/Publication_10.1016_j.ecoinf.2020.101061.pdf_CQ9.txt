I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning for RGB-based tree identification, cross-resolution training, and sensitivity studies, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is located. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository where the data is available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF).
