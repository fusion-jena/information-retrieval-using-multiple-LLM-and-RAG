The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context are based on geographical coordinates. The data is first split into larger blocks depending on coordinates, and then each block is further divided into smaller areas of 80 × 80 pixels. A 10-fold cross-validation is performed, where the map is split into a 3 × 3 grid, resulting in 10 sets in total. Nine of these sets are used for training, and the final one is used for evaluation. Additionally, 20% of the training samples are used as a validation set to prevent overfitting.
