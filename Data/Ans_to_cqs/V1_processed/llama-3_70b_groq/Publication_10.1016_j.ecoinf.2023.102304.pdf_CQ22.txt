Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The kappa coefficient is specifically used to comprehensively evaluate the detection accuracy for different indices and parameter sets. There is no mention of precision, recall, or other metrics typically used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. However, it is mentioned that the user's accuracy is always higher than the producer's accuracy, which suggests that the model tends to have a larger omission error than commission error.
