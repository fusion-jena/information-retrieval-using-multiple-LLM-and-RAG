I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research article about applying an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting mosquito abundances in urban areas. It discusses the importance of selecting the number of layers, neurons, learning rates, and epochs for model training, but it does not provide a link to a code repository.
