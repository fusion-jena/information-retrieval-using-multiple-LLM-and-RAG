The hyperparameters of the SVM model were optimized using a sensitivity analysis method, as mentioned in the study by Heydari and Mountrakis (2018). The "gamma" parameter in the RBF kernel was tested with values of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 300, while the "cost" parameter was tested with values of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. The optimal combination of "gamma" and "cost" was selected based on the highest overall accuracy achieved. 

However, it is not explicitly stated whether a grid search or random search was used to optimize the hyperparameters. It is only mentioned that 50% of the reference data was randomly selected for parameter optimization. Therefore, it can be inferred that a random search was likely used, but it is not explicitly confirmed.
