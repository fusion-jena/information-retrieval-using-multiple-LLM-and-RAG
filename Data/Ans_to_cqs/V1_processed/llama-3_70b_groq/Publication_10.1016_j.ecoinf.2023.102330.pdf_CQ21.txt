Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a study on Northern bobwhite density estimation using distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture models, and it discusses the model components, priors, and parameters, as well as the calculation of bias and precision using root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation (CV). However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps typically used in machine learning or deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
