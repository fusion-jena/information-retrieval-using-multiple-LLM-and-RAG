I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, mapping, and scientific communication, with references to papers on topics such as measuring ecosystem heterogeneity, colour vision deficiency, and visualization best practices. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
