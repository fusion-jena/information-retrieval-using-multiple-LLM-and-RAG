I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research article or paper that discusses the use of deep learning for plant species classification and cover information extraction, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. The references cited in the text are mostly academic papers and do not seem to be related to a specific data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
