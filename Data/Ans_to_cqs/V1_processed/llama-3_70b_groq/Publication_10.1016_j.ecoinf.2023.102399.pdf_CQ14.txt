I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It presents various results and comparisons of different models, including YOLOv5n and DL-YOLO, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. The context includes tables with estimated weights, efficiencies, and accuracies, as well as figures comparing model effects, but it does not discuss the optimization methods used to tune the hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot determine how the hyperparameters are optimized based on the provided context.
