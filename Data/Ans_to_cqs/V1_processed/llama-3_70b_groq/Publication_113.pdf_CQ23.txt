Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on active learning strategies, dimensionality reduction, and transfer learning. It discusses the use of a large dataset, such as the NACTI dataset, and the application of active learning pipeline on the crops produced from running the MegaDetector model over the dataset. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
