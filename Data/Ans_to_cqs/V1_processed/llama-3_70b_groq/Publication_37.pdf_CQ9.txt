Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the methodology and results of the classification of migrating birds' flight calls using deep learning techniques, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
