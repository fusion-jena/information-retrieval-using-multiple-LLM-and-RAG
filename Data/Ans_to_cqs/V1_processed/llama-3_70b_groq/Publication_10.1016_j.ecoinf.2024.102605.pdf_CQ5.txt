I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, ecology, and agriculture, with references to various research papers and journals. The papers mentioned seem to focus on topics like hyperspectral imaging, machine learning, and vegetation indices, but do not mention deep learning datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
