PyTorch is used to build the deep learning model. This is mentioned in the context as "Pytorch (Paszke et al., 2019) ML framework for deep learning (CNNs)". Additionally, skorch, a scikit-learn compatible neural network library that wraps PyTorch, is also used to simplify the training and evaluation procedure.
