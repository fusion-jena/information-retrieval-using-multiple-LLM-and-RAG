The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The text focuses on the application of semantic segmentation and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to extract detailed information from landscape photos, particularly for estimating distances to trees. 

However, it is worth noting that the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) can be seen as a way to handle randomness or uncertainty in the output of the deep learning model. CRF is a probabilistic model that can refine the output of a neural network by considering the relationships between neighboring pixels. This can help to reduce the randomness or uncertainty in the output, leading to more accurate and detailed results.

In general, strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines may include techniques such as fixing random seed values, using dropout layers, data augmentation, and ensemble methods. However, these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
