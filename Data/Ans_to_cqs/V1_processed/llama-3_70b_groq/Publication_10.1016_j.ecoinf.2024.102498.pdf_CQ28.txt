I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The context mentions Google Earth Engine in one of the references, but it is not clear if this is related to the deployment of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
