The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to digitized natural history collections, but it does not specify the exact datasets used. It mentions that the CNNs are used for image classification, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used for training and testing the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
