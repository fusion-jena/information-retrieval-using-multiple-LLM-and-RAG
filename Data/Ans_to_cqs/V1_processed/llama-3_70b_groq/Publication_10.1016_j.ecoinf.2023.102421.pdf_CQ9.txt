I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the MSAVI index, LightGBM algorithm, and a research study on estimating Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) in Quang Ninh province, Vietnam. The context provides information on the study area, data specifications, and preparation, as well as the algorithms used, but it does not mention where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
