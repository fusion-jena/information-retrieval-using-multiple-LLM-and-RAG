The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that data augmentation (DA) is used to artificially increase and diversify the training data, and that the fast auto-augmentation (FAA) method is applied to improve the data. It also mentions that FAA can discover effective augmentation policies, but it does not specify what these policies are.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
