Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the introduction to deep learning, its development, and its application in ecological prediction. It discusses the architecture of deep neural networks, the importance of training data, and the evaluation of prediction accuracy. However, it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
