The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The study focuses on applying machine learning to predict reproductive condition in fish, specifically using Random Forest (RF) analysis to classify maturity stages in Chilean hake. The data used in the study appears to be related to gonadal development, with gonads randomly collected from commercial industrial and acoustic surveys. 

However, there is no mention of image, audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the study. It is possible that the data is in a tabular format, such as CSV, given that the study involves classification of maturity stages based on gonadal development, but this is not explicitly stated.
