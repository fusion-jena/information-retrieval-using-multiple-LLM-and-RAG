The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecology, discussing topics such as forest biomass, carbon storage, and spatial distribution of forest types. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning models, let alone their hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
