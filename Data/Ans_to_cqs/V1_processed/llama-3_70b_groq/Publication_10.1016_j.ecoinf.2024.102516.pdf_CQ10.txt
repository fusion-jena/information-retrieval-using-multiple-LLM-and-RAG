I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text only provides information about the research paper, including the abstract, keywords, and references, but it does not include a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the code repository as it is not available in the given context.
