The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the optimization of parameters for a model to better capture the index response to wildfire, the evaluation of model performance using accuracy and kappa metrics, and the feature importance calculation using XGBoost and Random Forest. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
