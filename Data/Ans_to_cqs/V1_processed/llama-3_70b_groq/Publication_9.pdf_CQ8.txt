Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions the publication details and the DOI of the paper, but it does not provide a link to the code repository.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question. The code repository might be available, but it is not mentioned in the provided context.
