Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through precision and recall trade-offs. This method allows for assessing the overall effectiveness of the model. Additionally, hard negative mining is used to focus on challenging negative examples during the training process, which helps the model learn to better distinguish between objects and background regions, leading to improved overall performance. However, the exact strategy for monitoring model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
