I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, feature extraction, and recognition, as well as the importance of preprocessing and data augmentation. However, it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
