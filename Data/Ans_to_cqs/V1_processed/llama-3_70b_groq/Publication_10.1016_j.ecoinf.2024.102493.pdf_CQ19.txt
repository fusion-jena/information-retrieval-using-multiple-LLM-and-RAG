I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, vegetation dynamics, and kNDVI classification, but it does not provide information about the deep learning model or its framework. The references cited are related to various topics such as marketing research, hydrology, and ecology, but none of them mention deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework is used to build the deep learning model.
