I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a collection of research papers and articles on various topics, including machine learning, forest ecosystem services, and agrifood systems. None of the references mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
