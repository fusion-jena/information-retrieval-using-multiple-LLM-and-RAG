Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically GRU, for predicting sea surface temperature (SST) and significant wave height (SWH) using a dataset from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. It discusses the architecture of the GRU model and its performance compared to other machine learning and statistical models. However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
