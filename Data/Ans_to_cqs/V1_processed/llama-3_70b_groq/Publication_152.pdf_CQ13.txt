Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. However, it does mention "Adam" in reference [27], which is a stochastic optimization algorithm commonly used as an optimizer in deep learning models. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Adam optimizer might be used in the model, but the learning rate and other hyperparameters are not specified.
