I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam. The context appears to be related to forest biomass estimation using airborne LiDAR data, GEDI data, and machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
