Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing is random augmentation of the presence spectrograms by applying a time-shift operation. This is mentioned in the text as a way to overcome class imbalance issues, where the number of spectrograms in both classes (presence and absence) are made equal by generating synthetic spectrograms through time-shifting. There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias.
