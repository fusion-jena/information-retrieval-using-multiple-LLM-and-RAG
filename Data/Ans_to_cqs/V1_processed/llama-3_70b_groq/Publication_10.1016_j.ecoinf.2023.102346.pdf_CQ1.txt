Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, microbiology, and ecology, with references to various studies and datasets. However, it does not provide specific information on data collection methods for deep learning pipelines.

Some of the studies mentioned in the context use datasets such as Bio-ORACLE, which is a global environmental dataset for marine species distribution modeling. Others use data from litter decomposition, microbial communities, and Baltic Sea eutrophication. However, the context does not describe how these datasets were collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
