I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, discussing the use of remote sensing data and various datasets. The paper mentions the Google Earth Engine platform, but it does not provide information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
