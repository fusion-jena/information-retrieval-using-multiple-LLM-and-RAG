The context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention "Google Earth Engine" in the keywords, which suggests that Google Earth Engine might have been used as a platform for processing and deploying the model. But it's not explicitly stated, so I can't confirm it with certainty.
