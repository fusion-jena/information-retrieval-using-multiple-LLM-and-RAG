The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation metric, specifically the F1 score. The model is trained on 70% of the training data and validated against 30% of the training data in each iteration. The F1 score is calculated on the validation set, and the model training stops when the F1 score does not improve in successive iterations. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is generalizing well to unseen data.
