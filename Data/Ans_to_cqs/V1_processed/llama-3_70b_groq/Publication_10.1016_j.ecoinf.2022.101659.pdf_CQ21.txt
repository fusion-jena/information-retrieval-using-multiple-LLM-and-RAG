I don't know.

The provided context does not mention model training, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to aquaculture, bivalves, and ecosystem services, discussing topics such as valve gaping, clearance rates, respiration, and bioenergetic models. There is no mention of machine learning or postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
