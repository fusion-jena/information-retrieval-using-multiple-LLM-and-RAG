The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the comparison of citizen science and deep learning methods for counting wildebeest in survey images, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps or bias mitigation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is mentioned that the training dataset was created by selecting 500 survey images at random, and then passing them through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. The results were then filtered by discarding any object detections that did not correspond to an identification from the Zooniverse data. This suggests that some form of filtering or data cleaning was performed, but it is not clear if any specific techniques were used to address data bias.

Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
