The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for species identification of pollen. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier that is trained on a large dataset of pollen images to identify different species of pollen. The model is designed to classify pollen images into their respective species, with the goal of achieving high accuracy.
