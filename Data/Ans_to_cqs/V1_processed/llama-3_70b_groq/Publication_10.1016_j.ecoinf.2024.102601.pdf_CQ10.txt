I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be discussing hyperparameter optimization for a random forest model using scikit-learn's RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
