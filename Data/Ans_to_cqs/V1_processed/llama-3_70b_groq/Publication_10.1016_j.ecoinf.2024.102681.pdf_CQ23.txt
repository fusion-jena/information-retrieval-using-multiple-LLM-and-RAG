Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN-LSTM hybrid model, its performance improvement, and the compilation of a comprehensive dataset for drought propagation analysis. It does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
