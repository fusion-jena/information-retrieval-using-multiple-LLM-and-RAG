Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of Elastic Net to improve the performance of a deep learning model, the use of Stacked Denoising Autoencoders, and the formulation of a loss function for training a Stacked Autoencoder. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular context. However, in general, preprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, feature selection, handling missing values, and data transformation.
