I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be discussing artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their application in ecology and environmental engineering, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
