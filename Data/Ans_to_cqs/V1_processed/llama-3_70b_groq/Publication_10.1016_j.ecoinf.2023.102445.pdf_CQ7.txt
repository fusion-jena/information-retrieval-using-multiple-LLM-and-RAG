Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, network architecture, and components of the YOLOv8 model, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
