The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Specifically, the ResNet model, which is a type of CNN, is mentioned as a baseline model. Additionally, the ViT network, which is a type of Transformer, is mentioned as a newer architecture that failed to improve on the results of ResNet. The Swin network, which is also a type of Transformer, is mentioned as a model that outperformed ResNet. Finally, the ConvNeXt model, which is an evolution of ResNet, is mentioned as another model that outperformed ResNet. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in the provided context.
