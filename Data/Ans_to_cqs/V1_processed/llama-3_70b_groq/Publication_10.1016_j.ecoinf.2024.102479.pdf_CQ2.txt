I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental variables, but it does not provide information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. It mentions Sentinel-2 data, which is likely to be image data, but it does not explicitly state the format. Additionally, it references tables (e.g., Table 1, Table S3) that may contain CSV data, but this is not explicitly stated either. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
