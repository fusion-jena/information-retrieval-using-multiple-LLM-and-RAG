I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the platform used for deployment. The context appears to be related to a research study on estimating net growth in Atlantic Forest fragments using machine learning models, but it does not provide information about the deployment of the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
