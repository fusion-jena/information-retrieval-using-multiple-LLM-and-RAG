I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hardware resources used for training the machine learning models. The text only discusses the use of seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. It presents the results of the models in terms of their performance metrics, such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values, but does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources, such as GPUs or TPUs, were used for training the models.
