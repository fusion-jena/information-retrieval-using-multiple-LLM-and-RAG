The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the architecture of the model, the training process, and the evaluation metrics, but it does not specify any regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
