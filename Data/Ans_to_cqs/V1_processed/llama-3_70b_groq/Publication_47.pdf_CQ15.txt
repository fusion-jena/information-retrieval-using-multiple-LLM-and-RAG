The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text only describes the implementation of a deep neural network algorithm (IUC-NN) as an R package based on the Python TensorFlow library, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
