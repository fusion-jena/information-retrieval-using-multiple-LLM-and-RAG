The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset to assess the number of recordings necessary to yield satisfactory classification metrics. This suggests that the model was trained on different subsets of the data, which could help improve its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset was partitioned into training and validation sets, with 70% of the data designated for training and 30% for validation, using random selection. This is a common practice to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting. However, it is not clear if this was done using stratified splitting or other techniques to ensure that the validation set is representative of the overall dataset.

Overall, while the context provides some information about the model's training and validation process, it does not provide explicit details on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
