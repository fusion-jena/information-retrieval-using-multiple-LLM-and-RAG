The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of specific CNN architectures such as VGG16, ResNet152-V2, VGGish, YAMNet, and BirdNet in the context. These models are all variants of CNNs, with some being pre-trained on ImageNet (a visual modality dataset) and others on AudioSet (an audio modality dataset). The context also mentions the evaluation of embeddings at different layers within these CNNs, further supporting the conclusion that CNNs are the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
