The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text discusses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their applications, as well as model performance assessment techniques and hyperparameter tuning using randomized grid search methods. However, it does not specify the framework used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
