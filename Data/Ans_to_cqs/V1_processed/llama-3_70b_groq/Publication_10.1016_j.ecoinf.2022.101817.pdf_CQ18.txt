The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the CNN models. The confusion matrices generated during the cross-validation phase are shown in Fig. 7, which suggests that the model performance was monitored and evaluated using this technique. Additionally, the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score are reported for each model, indicating that these metrics were used to monitor and compare the performance of the models during training.
