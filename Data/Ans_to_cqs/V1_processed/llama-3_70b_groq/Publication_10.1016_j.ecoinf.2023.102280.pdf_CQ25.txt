The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of bioacoustics applications is primarily for noise reduction or denoising, specifically for speech enhancement. The models are designed to remove noise from audio signals, resulting in a cleaner and more intelligible output. This is achieved through the use of techniques such as U-net architectures, transformer attention mechanisms, and raw waveform data processing. The goal is to improve the quality of the audio signal, making it more suitable for analysis, classification, or other downstream tasks.
