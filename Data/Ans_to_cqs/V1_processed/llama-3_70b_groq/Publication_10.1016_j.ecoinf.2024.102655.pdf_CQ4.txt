I don't know. The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context only discusses machine learning models, specifically ANFIS, ANN, and SVM, and their performance on a dataset. It does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
