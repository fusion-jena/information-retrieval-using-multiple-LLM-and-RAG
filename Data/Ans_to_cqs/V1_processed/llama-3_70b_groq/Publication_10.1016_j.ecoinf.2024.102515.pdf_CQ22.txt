I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any metrics to evaluate its performance. The text discusses the use of the Twitter API to collect tweets, the filtering process to remove invalid tweets, and the criteria used to search for tweets related to biodiversity observations. It does not provide information about the evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
