Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

In the section 2.7. Accuracy Assessment, it is mentioned that "The confusion/error matrix and subsequent metrics are..." which suggests that the confusion matrix is one of the postprocessing steps. 

Additionally, the context also mentions the calculation of metrics such as testing accuracy and kappa, which are used to evaluate the performance of the models. 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether saliency maps are involved in the postprocessing steps or not.
