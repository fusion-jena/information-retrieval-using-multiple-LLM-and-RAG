The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search or random search. However, it does describe a search process that involves exploring different regions within a given search range, which suggests that the optimization method may be a type of random search or heuristic search.

The context mentions that the search process is categorized into two phases: global search or exploration, and local search or exploitation. This implies that the optimization method may involve an initial random exploration of the search space, followed by a more focused search in promising regions.

Additionally, the context mentions that the hyperparameters with the current results are saved until better accuracy is achieved, and that the termination criterion is the maximum number of iterations to be executed. This suggests that the optimization method may involve an iterative process that continues until a stopping criterion is reached.

Overall, while the exact optimization method is not specified, the context suggests that it may involve a type of random or heuristic search that balances exploration and exploitation to find the optimal hyperparameters.
