Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions "Supplementary Dataset S1" but does not provide a link to a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
