Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models in biodiversity assessment, image classification, and domain adaptation.

However, it can be inferred that the images used in the study were not preprocessed in a standardized way, as the authors mention the use of "non-standardized, low-quality images" and the need for "careful consideration" of imaging conditions and classification algorithms.

Additionally, the context does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the data. It only mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent algorithm with softmax cross-entropy loss, batch size, and learning rate, but does not elaborate on any preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study, as they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
