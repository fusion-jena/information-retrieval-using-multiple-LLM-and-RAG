Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks, for plant species identification and plant cover estimation. It discusses the advantages and limitations of using dedicated plant cover data for training the network, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
