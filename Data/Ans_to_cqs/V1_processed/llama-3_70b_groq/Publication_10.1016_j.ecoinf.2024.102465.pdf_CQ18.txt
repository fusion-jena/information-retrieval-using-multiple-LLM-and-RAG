Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the methodology used for sentiment analysis, including the selection of the LSTM-CNN model, and the use of XGBoost and SHAP for interpretation and visualization. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
