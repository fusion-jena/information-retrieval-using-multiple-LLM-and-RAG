The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context mentions two image datasets: 

1. Salmon scale 9056 image dataset with doi:10.21335/NMDC-1050865887
2. Expert reading of extra 150 335/NMDC-1462728994 image dataset with doi:10.21

These datasets seem to be specific to the task of fish age estimation, which is not a common deep learning benchmark dataset. The paper also references ImageNet in the references section, but it is not explicitly mentioned as a dataset used in the pipeline.
