The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the selection and description of NDVI datasets from various sources, such as MODIS, AVHRR, and SPOT/VEGETATION, and their strengths and weaknesses. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
