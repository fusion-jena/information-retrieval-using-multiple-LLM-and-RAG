I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning models for bird species classification, transfer learning, and the architecture of the Wav2vec model, but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the code repository as it is not mentioned in the context.
