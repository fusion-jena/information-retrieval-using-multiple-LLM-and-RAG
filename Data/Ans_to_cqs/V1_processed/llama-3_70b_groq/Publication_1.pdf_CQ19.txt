The provided context does not explicitly mention which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the concepts of deep learning, its applications, and its advantages, but it does not specify any particular framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
