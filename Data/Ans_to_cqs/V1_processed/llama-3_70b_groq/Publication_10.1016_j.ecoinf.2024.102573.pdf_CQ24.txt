Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on bird species recognition, bioacoustics analysis, and the application of deep neural networks in these areas. It discusses the advantages of using neural networks, automatic feature extraction, and the choice of input representations for neural networks.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention uncertainty in deep neural networks in the title of one of the referenced papers (Gawlikowski et al., 2023). This paper might discuss strategies for handling randomness or uncertainty in deep learning pipelines, but this information is not provided in the given context.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves techniques such as setting random seed values, using dropout layers, batch normalization, and ensemble methods. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.
