The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a combination of manual tuning and grid search. For the two-part split, hyperparameters were tuned using grid search, which performs an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator. This algorithm automatically generates the validation sets internally, so there is no need to generate a validation set to select the best model. For the three-part split, further tuning of the parameters was done manually.
