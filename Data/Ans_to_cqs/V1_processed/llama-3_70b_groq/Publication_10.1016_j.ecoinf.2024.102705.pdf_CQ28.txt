I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the concept of deep learning, neural networks, and optimization algorithms, as well as the application of deep learning in ecological tasks, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
