Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors used a technique called "balanced sampling" to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they selected one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of five for each type of anuran call to create a balanced test set. This suggests that they aimed to ensure that each class had a similar number of samples to prevent bias towards any particular class.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether they used stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection techniques to address data bias. The context only mentions data augmentation, which is a technique used to increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations to the existing samples, but it does not directly address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that balanced sampling was used, but I don't know if the other techniques mentioned in the query were used or not.
