According to the provided context, one preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is normalization. Specifically, the RGB channels were normalized by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel. This step was performed to align the unsupervised classifications with the ImageNet pretraining weights. 

No other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data was annotated, either automatically using a LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm or manually through hand-annotations, which could be considered a form of data cleaning. 

Data augmentation techniques such as random flips and translations were also tested, but they were found to have little effect on the final score.
