I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing data management and repositories for ecological samples, specifically fish samples, and how they can be made FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) through the use of standards and controlled vocabularies. There is no mention of deep learning models or machine learning techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
