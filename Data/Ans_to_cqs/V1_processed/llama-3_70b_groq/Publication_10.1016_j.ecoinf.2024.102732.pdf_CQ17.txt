The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses Support Vector Regression (SVR) and its effectiveness in capturing nonlinear relationships in data, as well as its ability to balance model complexity and empirical risk. It also mentions other machine learning methods like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression, but does not delve into regularization techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
