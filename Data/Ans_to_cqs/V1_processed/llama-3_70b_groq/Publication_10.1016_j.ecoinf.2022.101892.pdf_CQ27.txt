Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the training process, including the use of PyTorch, pre-training on the ImageNet dataset, fine-tuning on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets, and applying data augmentation to avoid overfitting and imbalanced problems. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
