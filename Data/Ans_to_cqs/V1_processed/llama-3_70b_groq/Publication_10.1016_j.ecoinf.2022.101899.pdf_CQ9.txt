I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is stored. The references cited are mostly academic papers and online resources such as Google Earth Engine and Google Maps, but there is no mention of a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
