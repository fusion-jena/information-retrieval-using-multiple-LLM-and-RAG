I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a collection of references and figures related to classification results, soil mapping, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
