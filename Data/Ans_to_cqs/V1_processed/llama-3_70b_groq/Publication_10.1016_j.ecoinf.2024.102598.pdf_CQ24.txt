I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning models, including random forests, for forest fire occurrence prediction and susceptibility mapping. It also mentions the use of cross-validation and optimized parameters for model calibration and validation. However, it does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
