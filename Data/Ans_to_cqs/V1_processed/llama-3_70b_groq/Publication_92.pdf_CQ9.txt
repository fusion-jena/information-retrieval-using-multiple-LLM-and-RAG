I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture of the network, the use of inception layers, and the post-processing and bounding box fusion steps, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) where the data is stored.
