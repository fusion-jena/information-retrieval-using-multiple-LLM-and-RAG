I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research article discussing a study on drought propagation and prediction using a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, but it does not provide information about where the data or code is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
