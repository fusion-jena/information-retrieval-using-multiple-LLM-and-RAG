I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the RF model, its hyperparameters, and the grid search approach used to optimize them. It does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
