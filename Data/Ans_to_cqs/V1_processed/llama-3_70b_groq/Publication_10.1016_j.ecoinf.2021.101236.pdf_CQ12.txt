The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Residual Network (ResNet), which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the text: "Our model is based on a residual network or ResNet." Additionally, the text mentions the use of convolutional layers with 3x3 kernels, batch normalization, and ReLU activation, which are all typical components of a CNN. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
