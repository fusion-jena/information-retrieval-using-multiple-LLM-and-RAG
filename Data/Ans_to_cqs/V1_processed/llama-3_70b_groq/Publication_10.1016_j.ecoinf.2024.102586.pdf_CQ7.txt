The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses the study of invasive alien species, data sources, and data analysis using a random forest (RF) model, but it does not provide information about deep learning model training or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
