Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on drought assessment and prediction using deep learning models, specifically CNN-LSTM hybrid models. It discusses the architecture of the model, the dataset used, and the advantages of using a hybrid model. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
