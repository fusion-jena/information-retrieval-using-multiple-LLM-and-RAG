Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning process for the Random Forest (RF) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models using grid search technique. It discusses the various hyperparameters tested for both models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
