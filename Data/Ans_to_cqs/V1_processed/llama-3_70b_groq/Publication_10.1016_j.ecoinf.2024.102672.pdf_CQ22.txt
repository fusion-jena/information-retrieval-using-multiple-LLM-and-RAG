The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, AUC, MAE, and Percentile (P50). These metrics are mentioned in the provided context, specifically in Table 2, which contains the results of the model evaluation. The context also mentions that there were no discrepancies among the three metrics used during the cross-validation process, and the model with the highest AUC was chosen in case of small discrepancies.
