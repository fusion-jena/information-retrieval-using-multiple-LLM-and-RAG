The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the model optimization process, data partitioning, and the use of the grid search method to optimize hyperparameters. It mentions that the R value of the validation set is used as the performance indicator during the optimization process, but it does not specify when training is considered complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
