I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the model training procedure, the use of transfer learning with COCO pre-trained weights, and a ResNet-101 CNN, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search.
