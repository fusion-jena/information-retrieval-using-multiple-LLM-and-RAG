According to the provided context, no hyperparameter tuning has been conducted. The models were executed with the default FIT parameters on the full dataset to assure uniformity. This implies that the hyperparameters were not optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. Instead, the default parameters were used for all species to maintain comparability between the methods.
