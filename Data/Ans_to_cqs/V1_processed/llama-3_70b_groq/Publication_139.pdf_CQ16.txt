According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is early stopping, which is used to prevent overfitting. The context does not explicitly mention a validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete. However, it does mention that the model typically trains between 10 and 15 epochs before training ceases, suggesting that the training process is stopped when the model converges or reaches a certain level of performance.
