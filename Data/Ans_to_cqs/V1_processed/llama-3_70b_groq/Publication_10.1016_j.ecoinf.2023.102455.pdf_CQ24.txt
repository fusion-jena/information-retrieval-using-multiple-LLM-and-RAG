The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention some aspects related to randomness, such as weight_random_range and bias_random_range in the RVFL model, which suggests that some form of randomization is used in the model's architecture. 

Additionally, the context mentions metaheuristic optimization algorithms, which often rely on randomization to search for optimal solutions. It also mentions cross-validation schemes, which can help reduce the impact of randomness in model evaluation. 

However, it does not provide specific information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I don't know the specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
