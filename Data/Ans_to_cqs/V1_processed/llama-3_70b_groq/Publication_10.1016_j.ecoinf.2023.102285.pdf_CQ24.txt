I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to a research paper in ecological informatics, discussing topics such as model construction, testing, evaluation, and validation, as well as image processing and object detection in maritime environments. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
