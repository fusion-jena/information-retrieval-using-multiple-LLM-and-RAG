The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context mentions "Datasets 1, 2, and 3" but does not specify what these datasets are. It does mention ImageNet in a reference to a paper by Krizhevsky et al. (2012), but it does not indicate that ImageNet is one of the datasets used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
