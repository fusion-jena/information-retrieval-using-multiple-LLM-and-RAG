I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on machine learning algorithms for habitat suitability prediction and species distribution modeling, with a mention of various machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.
