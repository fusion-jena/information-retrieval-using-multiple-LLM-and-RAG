I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform of the deep learning model. It discusses the use of satellite images, machine learning algorithms, and data sources such as USGS, CRESDA, and Copernicus, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
