Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on data standardization, statistical models, and analysis of dependencies. It does not discuss deep learning models or any techniques used to ensure their generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
