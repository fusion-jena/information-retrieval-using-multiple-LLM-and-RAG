Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on tuning the parameters of a machine learning model, specifically a grid search method to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
