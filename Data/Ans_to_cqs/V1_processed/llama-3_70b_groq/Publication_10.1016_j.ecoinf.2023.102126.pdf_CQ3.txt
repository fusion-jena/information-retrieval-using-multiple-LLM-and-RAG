I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to data sharing, repositories, and FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of research data, but it does not provide information on specific techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
