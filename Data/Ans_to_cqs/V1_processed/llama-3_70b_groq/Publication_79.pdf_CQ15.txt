Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-net, and semantic segmentation, for vegetation pattern recognition and tree crown delineation in remote sensing imagery. It does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
