The context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it is mentioned that "the number of stacked LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model hyperparameters were selected through various experiments to achieve optimal performance." This suggests that the hyperparameters were tuned through some form of experimentation or trial-and-error, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
