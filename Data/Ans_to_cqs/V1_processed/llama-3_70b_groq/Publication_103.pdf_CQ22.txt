According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are top-1 and top-5 accuracy. This is mentioned in the "Experiments and results" section, where it is stated that "All experiments measured the top-1 and top-5 accuracy of the trained deep learning model under different circumstances..." 

There is no mention of precision, recall, or other evaluation metrics in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.
