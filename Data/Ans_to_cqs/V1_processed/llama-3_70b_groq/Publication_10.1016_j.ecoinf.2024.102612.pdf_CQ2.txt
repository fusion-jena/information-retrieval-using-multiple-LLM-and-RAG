The context mentions the use of LiDAR point clouds and MS imagery as input data formats in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, it references Sentinel-2 MS imagery, which suggests that the pipeline may also handle image data. There is no mention of audio or video data formats. It is also possible that CSV files may be used for storing or processing data, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely LiDAR point clouds and image data (specifically, MS imagery).
