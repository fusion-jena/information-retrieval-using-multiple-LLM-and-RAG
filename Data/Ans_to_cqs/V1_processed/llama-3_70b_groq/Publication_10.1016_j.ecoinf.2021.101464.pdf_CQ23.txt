The context does not mention a deep learning model, but rather a Random Forest (RF) model. To ensure the generalizability of the RF model, 10-fold cross-validation was used. This is mentioned in Section 2.2, where the results of the 10-fold cross-validation are shown in Table 5. The average R2 and RMSE values from the cross-validation are reported, indicating that the RF model has high simulation accuracy and good stability. However, there is no mention of a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other measures to ensure generalizability.
