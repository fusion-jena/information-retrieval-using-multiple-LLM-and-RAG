Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on model evaluation, performance comparison, and the architecture of the models. It does provide information on the loss function used, which is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), but it does not discuss the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
