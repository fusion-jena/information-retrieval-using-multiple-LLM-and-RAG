Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that "data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset for training and overcoming network overfitting" but does not provide details on the specific techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
