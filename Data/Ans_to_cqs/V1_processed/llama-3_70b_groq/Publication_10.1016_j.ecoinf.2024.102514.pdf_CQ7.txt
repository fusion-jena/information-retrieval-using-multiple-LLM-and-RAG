The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the WQ indicator data was divided into training and testing datasets with a ratio of 80% and 20%, respectively, which is a common practice in machine learning. 

It does not mention anything about a validation set, which is often used in deep learning model training. The context only discusses the training and testing datasets. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, including the validation set, based on the provided context.
