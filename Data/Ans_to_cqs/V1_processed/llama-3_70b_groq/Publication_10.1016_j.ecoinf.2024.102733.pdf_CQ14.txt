The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that "Various combinations of Pmean and Pstd values, along with typical hyperparameters of neural networks such as learning rate, batch size, and weight decay, were tested and explored. These values were assigned using random generators to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance." 

This suggests that the hyperparameters were optimized using a random search, where different combinations of hyperparameters were randomly generated and evaluated. However, it does not provide further details on the optimization process, such as whether a grid search was also used or if any other optimization techniques were employed.
