I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the trained models are used to generate a GIS layer of the presumable historical geographical distribution of wetlands, which is released as an open resource and can be freely used. However, it does not provide information about where this resource is hosted or made available. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available.
