Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is multi-spectral imagery. Specifically, the study uses an ortho-rectified, multi-spectral dataset consisting of four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near infrared) having a fine spatial resolution of 2 m and one panchromatic band (480â€“820 nm) having 0.50 m resolution. This suggests that the input data for the deep learning model is in the form of image data, specifically satellite imagery. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, while CSV files may be used for storing or processing other types of data, such as tabular data, there is no explicit mention of CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline.
