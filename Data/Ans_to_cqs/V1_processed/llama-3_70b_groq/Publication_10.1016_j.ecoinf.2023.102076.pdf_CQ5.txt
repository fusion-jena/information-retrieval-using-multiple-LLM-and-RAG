The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on a text classification pipeline, discussing issues with imbalanced datasets and the need for large training datasets. It mentions a hierarchical classification approach with a series of binary classification tasks, but does not specify the datasets used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
