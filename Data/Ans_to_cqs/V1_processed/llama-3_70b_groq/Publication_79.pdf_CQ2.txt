Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image data, specifically satellite images. The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-net architectures, which are commonly used for image segmentation tasks. Additionally, the context references papers that use high-spatial-resolution satellite data and WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 images, which suggests that the input data is in the form of images.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Similarly, there is no indication of CSV files being used as input data. It is possible that CSV files may be used for storing metadata or annotation information, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline appears to be image data, specifically satellite images.
