I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses various concepts such as spectral normalization, LeakyReLU activation, dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition, and generative models like CVAE and DR-ACGAN. It also presents some experimental results and comparisons between different models. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of these models are optimized, such as whether grid search, random search, or other methods are used.
