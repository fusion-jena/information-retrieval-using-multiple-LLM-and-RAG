The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, classification, and accuracy assessment in the context of plant population identification. It discusses various strategies to improve classification accuracy, including data augmentation, post-classification, and filtering, but it does not delve into data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
