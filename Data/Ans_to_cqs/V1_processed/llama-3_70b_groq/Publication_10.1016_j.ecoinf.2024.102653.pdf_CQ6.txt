Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the design of a deep-learning architecture for toxicovigilance, model training, and hyperparameters. It discusses the model's structure, including the use of BiLSTM layers, dropout regularization, and a densely connected layer. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
