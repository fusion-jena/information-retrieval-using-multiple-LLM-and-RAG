I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to the application of machine learning and deep learning in ecology and environmental science, but it does not provide specific information about regularization methods.

The context mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning in various ecological applications, such as species distribution, species identification, land use change characterization, and biodiversity conservation. It also mentions the importance of machine learning in improving the accuracy of results compared to traditional modeling techniques. However, it does not provide information about the specific techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
