According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Precision, Recall, and AP (Average Precision). 

Precision is the number of true objects predicted by the model as a proportion of the total number of detected objects. Recall is the number of true objects predicted by the model as a proportion of all the true detected objects. AP is the area under the Precision-Recall curve. 

Additionally, FPS (Frames Per Second) is also mentioned, which is used to evaluate the computational efficiency of the model. However, it is not a direct metric to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of accuracy.
