The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for ecoacoustic surveying, but it does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The dataset used in this study appears to be a custom dataset of audio files, which are processed and used to train the CNN model. The context mentions that the dataset was randomly selected from remaining sites, but it does not provide further information about the dataset. Therefore, I don't know the specific dataset used in this study.
