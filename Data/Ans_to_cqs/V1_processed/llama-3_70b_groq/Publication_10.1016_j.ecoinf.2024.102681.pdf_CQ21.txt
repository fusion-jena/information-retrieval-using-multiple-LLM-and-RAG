Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, the architecture of the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, and the analysis of drought propagation times. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that may be performed after the model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
