Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and their applications in estimating total nitrogen concentration in water using drone-borne hyperspectral imagery. It also mentions the use of a grid search to find the best number of trees (ntrees) in the RF model, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
