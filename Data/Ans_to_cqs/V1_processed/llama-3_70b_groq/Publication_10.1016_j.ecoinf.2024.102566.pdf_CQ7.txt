I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to forest biomass estimation, remote sensing, and forest inventory data, but it does not provide information about deep learning model training or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
