The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the 'select = T' parameter was used, which allows the smoothing parameter estimation to completely remove the influence of a specific variable in the model. However, it does not provide information on the optimization method used for hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
