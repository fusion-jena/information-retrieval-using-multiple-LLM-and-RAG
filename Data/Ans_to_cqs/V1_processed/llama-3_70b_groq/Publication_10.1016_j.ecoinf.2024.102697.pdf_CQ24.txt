The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on random forest models, which are a type of ensemble learning method, and their application in remote sensing. It discusses the advantages of random forest models, hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian Optimization, and model complexity.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of randomization in the random forest model, where many randomized decision trees are generated based on subsets of the input features. The results from each tree are then averaged to produce a more reliable result. This process helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's performance.

But, in terms of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the context does not provide any specific strategies or techniques. It does not mention deep learning or neural networks at all, and the discussion is limited to random forest models and their application in remote sensing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
