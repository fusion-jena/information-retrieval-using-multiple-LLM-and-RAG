The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention the use of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as evaluation metrics. These metrics are commonly used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values, but they do not provide information about accuracy, precision, and recall. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.
