I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters of a model, nor does it discuss grid search, random search, or any other method of hyperparameter optimization. The context appears to be related to ecological risk assessment, landscape spatial structure, and conservation planning, but it does not provide information on model optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
