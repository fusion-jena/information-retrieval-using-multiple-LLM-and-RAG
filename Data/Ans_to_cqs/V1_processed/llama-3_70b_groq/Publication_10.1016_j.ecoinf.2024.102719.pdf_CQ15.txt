The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm, which is used for hyperparameter tuning, and its application in machine learning models for river health predictions. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
