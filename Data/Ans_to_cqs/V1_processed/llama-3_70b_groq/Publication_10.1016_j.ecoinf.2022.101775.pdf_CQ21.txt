The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that a min-max scaler was used during training, and it was reverted at the end to compute the performance metrics in the test set. This implies that the model's output was transformed back to its original scale to calculate the performance metrics. 

The context does not provide information about other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, confusion matrix, or other metrics calculation. It only mentions that the performance metrics were computed, but it does not specify which metrics were used.
