I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning models, such as CNN and autoencoder, for estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices, and it provides information about the evaluation metrics and performance of the models. However, it does not provide any information about the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
