The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is RMSprop stochastic descent optimizer with the default parameters. This is mentioned in the context as "We chose the RMSprop stochastic descent optimizer with the default parameters [64]". There is no mention of SGD or Adam optimization techniques in the provided context.
