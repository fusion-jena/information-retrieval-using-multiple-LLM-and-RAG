Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on various applications of deep learning models in remote sensing, such as wetlands classification, mangrove crown diameter measurement, tree canopies segmentation, and individual tree crown segmentation. 

However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps might be involved, as the context mentions the use of various datasets and images. For instance, the context mentions the use of UAV-borne LiDAR data, airborne lidar data, and high spatial resolution UAV images, which might require preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before being used to train a deep learning model. 

Unfortunately, the context does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
