According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Overall Accuracy and Kappa Coefficient. 

The Overall Accuracy measures the proportion of pixels correctly classified out of the total number of pixels in the image. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of pixels correctly classified by the model to the total number of pixels, multiplied by 100%.

The Kappa Coefficient takes into account the chance agreement between classification and observations. It determines how much the classification accuracy exceeds random agreement. The Kappa Coefficient is calculated using the formula that involves the ratio of agreed pixels to the total number of pixels and the expected probability of agreement.

There is no mention of precision and recall in the provided context.
