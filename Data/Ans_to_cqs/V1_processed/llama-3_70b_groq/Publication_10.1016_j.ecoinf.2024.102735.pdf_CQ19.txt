The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses random forest models, Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, and references to various research papers on machine learning and uncertainty quantification. However, it does not provide information on the specific framework used to build a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
