I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a model or determining when training is complete. The text appears to be discussing Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics, but it does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
