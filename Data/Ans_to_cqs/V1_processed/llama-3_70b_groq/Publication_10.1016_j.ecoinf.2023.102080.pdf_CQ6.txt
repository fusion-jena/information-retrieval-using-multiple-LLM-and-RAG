The provided context does not specifically mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be focused on a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure for species distribution models, which involves a collinearity-filtering algorithm and model-specific embedded regularization techniques.

However, it can be inferred that the context is related to feature selection and dimensionality reduction, which are important preprocessing steps in machine learning and deep learning. The procedure described in the context is aimed at selecting the most relevant covariates for species distribution models, which can be seen as a form of feature selection.

But, it does not provide specific information about preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are typically performed before training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
