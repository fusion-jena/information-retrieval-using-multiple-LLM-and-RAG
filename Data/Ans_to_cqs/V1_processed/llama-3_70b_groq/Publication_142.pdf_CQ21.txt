Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be discussing various topics such as the challenges and opportunities of processing large datasets, the use of citizen science for classification, and the development of a custom RShiny app for expert assessment of plant images. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
