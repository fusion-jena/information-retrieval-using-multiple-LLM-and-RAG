I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific hardware resources used for training deep learning models, such as GPUs or TPUs. It discusses the use of an interface provided by a site for training and storing models, but it does not provide details about the underlying hardware infrastructure. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model.
