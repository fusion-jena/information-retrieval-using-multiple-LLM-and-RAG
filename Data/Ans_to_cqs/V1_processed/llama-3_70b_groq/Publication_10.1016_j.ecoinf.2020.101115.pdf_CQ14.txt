I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The text appears to be discussing a data model and vocabulary servers for a fish scale and otolith archive, and it provides information about the different parameters and vocabulary servers used. There is no mention of a machine learning model or its optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
