I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The text appears to be a research article discussing the use of deep learning for tree crown detection, but it does not include any information about the availability of the code used in the research. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is located.
