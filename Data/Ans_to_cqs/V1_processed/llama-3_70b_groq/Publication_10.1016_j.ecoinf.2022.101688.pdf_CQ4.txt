Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the comparison of different CNN architectures, transfer learning approaches, and the importance of input size selection for bioacoustics research. It does not discuss data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
