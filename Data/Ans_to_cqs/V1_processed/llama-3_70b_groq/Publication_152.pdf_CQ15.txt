According to the provided context, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Adam. This is mentioned in reference [27], which states "D.P.Kingma and J.Ba, “Adam: A method for stochastic optimization,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6980, 2014." This suggests that the Adam optimization algorithm is used for stochastic optimization in the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of other optimization techniques like SGD in the provided context.
