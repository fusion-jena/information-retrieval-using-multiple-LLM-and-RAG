The provided context does not specifically mention the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models. However, it does discuss the metrics used to evaluate the performance of models in general, particularly in the context of cetaceans and sea turtles.

According to the text, the most common metrics used include the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC curve), TSS, Cohen's Kappa, Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Precision. Additionally, the text mentions that some studies used multiple validation metrics simultaneously to assess different aspects of model performance.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive list of metrics used to evaluate deep learning models specifically. If you are looking for information on deep learning model evaluation metrics, you may need to consult additional resources.
