Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the VAE model, the optimization objective, and the exploration of the latent space, but it does not provide information on how the model was trained or validated to ensure generalizability.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset that was "recorded at a different location and was gradually expanded until reconstructions were sufficiently good." This suggests that the dataset may have been diverse and expanded to improve the model's performance, but it is not clear if this was done to specifically ensure generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was compared to a non-adaptive VAE, which "was more cumbersome to train as the model collapsed frequently during training." This implies that the authors may have experimented with different training approaches or hyperparameters to improve the model's performance, but again, it is not clear if this was done to ensure generalizability.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
