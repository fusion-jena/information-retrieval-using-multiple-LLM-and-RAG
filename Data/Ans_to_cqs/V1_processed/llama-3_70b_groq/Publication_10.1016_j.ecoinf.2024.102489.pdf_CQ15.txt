The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm, but not a deep learning algorithm. The optimization technique mentioned in the context is a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation, which is used to search for the optimal parameters of the RF model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
