The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions the training parameters, such as the number of epochs (500), initial learning rate, and optimizer, but it does not specify a stopping criterion like validation loss plateau. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
