The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the context is related to "remote sensing semantic segmentation with transformer", which suggests that a Transformer model might be involved. But it is not clear if this is the only model used or if other models are also part of the pipeline.
