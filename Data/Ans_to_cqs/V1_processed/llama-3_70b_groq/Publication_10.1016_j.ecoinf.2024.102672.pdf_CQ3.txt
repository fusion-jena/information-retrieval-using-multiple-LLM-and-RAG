I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and their application to predict temperature profiles in water masses, as well as discussing hyperparameters and their optimization. There is no mention of data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
