The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing (RS) technology, land use and land cover (LULC) classification, and machine learning algorithms. It mentions various datasets related to LULC classification, such as CNLUCC, CLCD, Globeland30, FROM_GLC30, ESA-CCI_LC, MCD12Q1, and ESRI_Land_Cover_2020, but these are not related to deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
