The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the caret package in R. Specifically, the mtry hyperparameter is tuned using the caret package, while other hyperparameters are kept at their default values. The ntree parameter is explored with different settings, including 500, 1000, 5000, and 10,000. However, the exact optimization method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified in the provided context.
