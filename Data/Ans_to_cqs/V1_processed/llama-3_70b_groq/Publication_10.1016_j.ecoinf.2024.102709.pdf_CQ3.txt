Based on the provided context, it appears that bounding box annotation is one of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. This is inferred from the mention of "target bounding boxes" and "bounding box estimation" in the text. However, there is no explicit mention of instance segmentation as a data annotation technique used in this pipeline.

It's also worth noting that the context mentions the use of clusters of extracted numbers, images of single-trees, and other data types, but it does not provide detailed information on the specific annotation techniques used for these data types.

In summary, while bounding box annotation is likely used in this pipeline, the context does not provide sufficient information to confirm the use of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques.
