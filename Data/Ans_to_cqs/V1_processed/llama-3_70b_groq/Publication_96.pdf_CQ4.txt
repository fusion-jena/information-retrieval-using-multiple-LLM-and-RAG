The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text focuses on the methodology and results of the burned area mapping using Deep Learning techniques on Landsat 8 imagery, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
