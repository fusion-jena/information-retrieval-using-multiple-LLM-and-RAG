Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the model training procedure, the use of transfer learning, and the evaluation of the fish segmentation model efficacy. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
