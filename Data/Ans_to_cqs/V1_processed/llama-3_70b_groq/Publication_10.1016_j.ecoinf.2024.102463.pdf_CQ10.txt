I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the methodology and architecture of the Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks (HRHN) model, but it does not provide any information about the code implementation or a link to a repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
