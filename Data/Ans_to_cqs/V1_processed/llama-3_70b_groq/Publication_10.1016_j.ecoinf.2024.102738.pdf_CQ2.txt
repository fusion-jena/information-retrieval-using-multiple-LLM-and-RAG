I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification, remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS), but it does not provide information about data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
