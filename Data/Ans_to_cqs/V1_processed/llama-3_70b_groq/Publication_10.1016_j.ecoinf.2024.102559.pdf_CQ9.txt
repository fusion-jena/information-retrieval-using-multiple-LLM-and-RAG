I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. The context appears to be a collection of references related to machine learning, remote sensing, and ecology, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
