I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context appears to be related to image capture, processing, and metadata, but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model used. The only mention of deep learning is in the reference "Camera orientation to subject in satellite and aerial images with deep learning. Sci. Rep. 9, 14259.", but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used.
