The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing steps, model selection, and topic modeling using the ERNIE model and pyLDAvis Library. It discusses the calculation of perplexity and topic intensity, as well as the visualization of topics in tweets involving contaminated sites.

There is no mention of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. These steps are typically used to evaluate and interpret the performance of machine learning models, but they are not discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
