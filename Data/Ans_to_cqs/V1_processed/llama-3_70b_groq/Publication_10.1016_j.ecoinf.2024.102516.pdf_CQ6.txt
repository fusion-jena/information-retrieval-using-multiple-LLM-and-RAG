Based on the provided context, it appears that only one preprocessing step is mentioned, which is horizontal flipping for data augmentation in the first phase of training the network. There is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The input image resolution is fixed at 1536 Ã— 768 pixels, but it is not clear if any resizing or cropping is done before training. 

It is also worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the preprocessing steps involved in the training process. Therefore, it is possible that other preprocessing steps are involved, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
