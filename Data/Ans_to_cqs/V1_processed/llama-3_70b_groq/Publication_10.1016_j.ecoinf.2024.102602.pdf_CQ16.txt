According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on an early stop approach with a patience value of 16. This means that the training process is halted prematurely if the performance on a validation dataset fails to improve beyond a predefined threshold, thereby preventing overfitting and conserving computational resources. However, it does not explicitly mention a validation loss plateau as a specific criterion.
