Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the performance of different machine learning models, such as BTS-ANFIS, ANN, and SVM, and how using a reduced dataset (BTS) affects their performance. It also mentions that the CA and TSAWQI techniques are efficient in identifying tendencies in historical data and selecting the most representative scenarios for predictive model training. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
