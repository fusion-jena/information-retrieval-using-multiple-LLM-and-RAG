I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to forestry and remote sensing, discussing topics like GEDI data, AGBD, and Sentinel-2 models. It does not provide any information about deep learning or regularization methods.
