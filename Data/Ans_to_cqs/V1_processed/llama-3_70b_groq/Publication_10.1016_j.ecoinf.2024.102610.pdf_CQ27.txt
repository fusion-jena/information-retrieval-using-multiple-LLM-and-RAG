I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the processes involved in doing so, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on a systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious disease, as well as a research study involving feature elimination, model performance, and spatial cross-validation. There is no information provided about deploying a trained model.
