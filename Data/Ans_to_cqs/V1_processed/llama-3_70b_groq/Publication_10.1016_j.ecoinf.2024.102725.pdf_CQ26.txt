The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on NDVI reconstruction, time-series analysis, and vegetation cover study. It discusses various methods for reconstructing NDVI time series, such as harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS), Savitzky-Golay filter, and Bayesian prediction. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
