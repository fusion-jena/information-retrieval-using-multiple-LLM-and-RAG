Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with audio data, specifically echolocation clicks and acoustic signals from marine mammals. There is no explicit mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. 

Several papers and reports mention the analysis of acoustic data, such as Soldevilla et al. (2008), McDonald et al. (2009), and McCullough et al. (2021), which suggests that audio data is a primary focus. Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep neural networks for bioacoustic classification, further supporting the idea that audio data is being used.

While there is a mention of image data augmentation for deep learning in the context of a survey paper by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019), it is not clear if this is directly related to the deep learning pipeline in question.

In summary, based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio data.
