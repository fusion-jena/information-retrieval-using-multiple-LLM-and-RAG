The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of ResNet-50, a 50-layer convolutional neural network (CNN), which was developed and pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories. However, it does not specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used to implement ResNet-50.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
