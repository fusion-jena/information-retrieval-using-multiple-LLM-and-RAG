I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide any information about where the deep learning pipeline code is available. The context discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their applications, and their limitations, as well as the use of satellite data for chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval. However, it does not provide any information about the code repository of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
