I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the limitations of general deep learning networks in capturing accurate feature information from underwater optical images and the proposed solutions to overcome these limitations, including the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution. It also mentions the DP-FishNet approach, which combines pyramid vision transformers and CNNs to extract global and local features from underwater images. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
