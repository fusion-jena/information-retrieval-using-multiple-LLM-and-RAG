I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a research paper or article related to query-based attacks and membership inference attacks, and it provides information about the experimental configuration of datasets, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
