The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on acoustic detection and bird sound recognition, and it discusses data augmentation and the use of a binary detection outcome variable (yi,j) to indicate whether a call is a true detection or not. However, it does not provide information on specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
