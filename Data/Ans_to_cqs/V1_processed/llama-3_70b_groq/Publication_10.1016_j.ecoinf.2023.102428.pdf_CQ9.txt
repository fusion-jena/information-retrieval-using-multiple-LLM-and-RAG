I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation, but it does not provide information about where the data or code is stored. The context mentions various sources and references, but none of them seem to be related to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
