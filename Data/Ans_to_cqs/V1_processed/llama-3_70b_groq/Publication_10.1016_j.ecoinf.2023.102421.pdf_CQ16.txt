The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process, and the mean RMSE was used as the objective function (loss function). This suggests that the training process might have continued until the mean RMSE converged or reached a certain threshold. 

However, it does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau, number of epochs, or a specific value of the loss function. Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
