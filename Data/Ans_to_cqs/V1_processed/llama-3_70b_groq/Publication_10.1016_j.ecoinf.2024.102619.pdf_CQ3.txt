Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the importance of accurate annotations, the challenges of manual analysis, and the use of machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and scikit-learn for training and evaluating models. It also mentions the integration of automatic classification tools into annotation software, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
