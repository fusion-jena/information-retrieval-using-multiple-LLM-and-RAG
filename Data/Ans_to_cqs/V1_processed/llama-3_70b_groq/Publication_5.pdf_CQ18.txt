The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored by tracking the loss function, which reached its minimum value after approximately 5000 iterations. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated based on the loss function, and the training process was stopped when the loss function reached its minimum value. Additionally, the model score is mentioned to have reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations, indicating that the model's performance was also evaluated based on the model score. However, the exact strategy or metric used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated.
