I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily focuses on Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and their applications in Big Data analysis, biosecurity, and machine hearing for marine species identification. It discusses the advantages of ELMs, their methodology, and their ability to handle non-differential activation equations. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.
