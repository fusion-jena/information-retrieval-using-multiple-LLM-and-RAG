Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the model names mentioned in the context, such as MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, GoogleNet, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, ResNet18, InceptionResNetV2, and NASNetMobile, which are all variants of CNNs. Additionally, the context mentions "CNN models" and "transfer learning with HHOS" which further supports the conclusion that CNNs are being used.
