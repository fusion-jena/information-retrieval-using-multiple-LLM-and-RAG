The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is pixel-wise salient object annotation. This is mentioned in the context as "we manually segmented all salient trunks in each image to obtain pixel-wise salient object annotations." This suggests that each pixel in the image is annotated as either belonging to a salient object (tree trunk) or not. Additionally, the context also mentions "high-quality binary ground-truth masks" which further supports the use of pixel-wise annotation. There is no mention of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation in the provided context.
