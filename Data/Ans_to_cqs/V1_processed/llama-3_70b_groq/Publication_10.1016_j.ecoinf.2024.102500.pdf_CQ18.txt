The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is fivefold cross-validation. The dataset is split into five equal-sized folds, and five times, one of each fold is used for training and assessment. This process is validated, and the coefficient of determination (R2) or RMSE is averaged across five iterations with five folds to improve model performance and hyperparameter tuning efficiency estimation.
