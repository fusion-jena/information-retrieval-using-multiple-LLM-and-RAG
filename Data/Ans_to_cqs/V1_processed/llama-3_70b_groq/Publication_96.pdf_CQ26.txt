Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for burn scar mapping in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Landsat 8 imagery and Google Cloud computing. It discusses the methodology, data sources, and results of the study but does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
