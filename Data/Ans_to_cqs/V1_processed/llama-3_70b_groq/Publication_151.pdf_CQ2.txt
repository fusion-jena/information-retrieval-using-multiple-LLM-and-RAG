The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of simulated data sets, query sequences, and tree-based distances, but it does not specify the format of the input data.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the input data is likely to be in a format related to biological sequences or phylogenetic data, such as FASTA or Newick format, which are commonly used in phylogenetics and genomics. The text mentions query sequences, which suggests that the input data might be in a format that can be used to represent biological sequences.

But, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline.
