I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to machine learning and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques. The papers and references mentioned are about multiple-instance learning, content-based image retrieval, and hyperspectral tree crown classification, but they do not discuss data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
