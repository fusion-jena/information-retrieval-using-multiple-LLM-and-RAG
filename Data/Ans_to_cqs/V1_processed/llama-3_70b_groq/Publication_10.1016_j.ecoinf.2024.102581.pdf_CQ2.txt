Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image classification tasks. The text mentions "images" and "feature maps" in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which suggests that the input data is in image format. There is no mention of audio or video data formats. Additionally, the context does not provide any information about CSV files being used as input data.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely image data.
