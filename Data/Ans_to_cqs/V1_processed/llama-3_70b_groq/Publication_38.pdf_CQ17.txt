Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning networks to acoustic signal classification, particularly in the context of bat echolocation call detection. It discusses the performance of CNNs compared to other baselines and their ability to detect fainter and partially noise-masked bat calls. However, it does not provide information on the regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
