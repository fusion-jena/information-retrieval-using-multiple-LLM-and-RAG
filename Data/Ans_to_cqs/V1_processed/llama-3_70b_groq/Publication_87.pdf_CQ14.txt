I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It appears to be a code snippet for deleting pictures in a valid directory that were not used to train the model, followed by a table showing the sample size of the training and validation datasets. The rest of the context seems to be unrelated to hyperparameter optimization, discussing various topics such as PyTorch, a multispecies occupancy model, and package versions. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other method for optimizing hyperparameters.
