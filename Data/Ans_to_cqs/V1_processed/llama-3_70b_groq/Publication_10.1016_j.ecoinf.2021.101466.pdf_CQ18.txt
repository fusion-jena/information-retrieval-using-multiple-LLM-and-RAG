The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored using validation data. The context mentions that 80% of the 4000 images were used for training and the remaining 20% were used for validation. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on the validation set during training to monitor its progress.
