I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It discusses the models themselves, their architectures, and the hyperparameters used for training, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
