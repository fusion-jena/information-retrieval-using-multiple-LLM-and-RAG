I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any specific type of model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) being used in the pipeline. The context appears to focus on data modeling, vocabularies, and data management, but it does not provide information about the specific machine learning or deep learning models used in the pipeline.
