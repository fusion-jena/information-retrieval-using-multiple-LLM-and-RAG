Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, results, and discussions related to the pose models. It provides information about the training and test set sizes, precision results, and initial experiments, but it does not delve into the specifics of model performance monitoring during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
