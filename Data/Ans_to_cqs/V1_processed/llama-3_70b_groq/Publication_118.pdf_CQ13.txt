Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context focuses on the architecture of the autoencoder, the input and output layers, the convolutional and max-pooling layers, and the activation function used (ReLU). However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
