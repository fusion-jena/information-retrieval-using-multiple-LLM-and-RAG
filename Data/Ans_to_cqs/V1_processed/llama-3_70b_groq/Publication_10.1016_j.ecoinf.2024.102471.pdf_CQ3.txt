I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context discusses various topics, including the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, Wav2Vec pre-training and fine-tuning phases, and the application of deep learning in bird species classification. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
