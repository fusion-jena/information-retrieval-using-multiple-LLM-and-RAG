The context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the implementation of the CNN classifier was done in Python using the Keras high-level deep learning library and TensorFlow with GPU execution as the back-end engine. It does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
