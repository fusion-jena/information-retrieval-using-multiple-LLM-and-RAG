I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the performance of different deep learning models, such as DeepConvLSTM and CNN, and their validation accuracies. It also explains the model selection procedure and provides parameters for classical machine learning models. However, it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, that may have been applied in the deep learning pipeline.
