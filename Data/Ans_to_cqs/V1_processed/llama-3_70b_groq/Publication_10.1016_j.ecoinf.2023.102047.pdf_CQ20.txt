Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context discusses various deep learning models, such as EfficientDet and YOLOv5, and their architectures, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. 

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of TensorFlow object detection API, which can be run on various hardware resources, including GPUs and TPUs. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific hardware resources used for training the model.
