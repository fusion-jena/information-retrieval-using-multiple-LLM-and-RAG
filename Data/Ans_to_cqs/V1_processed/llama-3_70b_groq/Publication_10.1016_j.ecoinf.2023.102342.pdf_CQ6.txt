Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. The context primarily focuses on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and the Apriori algorithm for identifying frequent itemsets. It does not provide information on deep learning models or their preprocessing requirements.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
