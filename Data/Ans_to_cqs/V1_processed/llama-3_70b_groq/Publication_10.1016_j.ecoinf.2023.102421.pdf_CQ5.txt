The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context suggests that the dataset used is a tabulated dataset containing 268 sample plots with 39 features, which includes on-field AGB (Above-Ground Biomass) and independent features from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A. The features include various band values, polarization values, and vegetation indices such as ARVI (Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index) and MSAVI (Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index).
