The performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics are reported separately for each defined class, and averages over all classes are also reported. The formulas for calculating these metrics are provided in the context, which are: 

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, including its ability to correctly classify instances, avoid false positives and false negatives, and balance precision and recall.
