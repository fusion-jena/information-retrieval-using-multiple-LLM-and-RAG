The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that "a random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure." This suggests that randomness is introduced in the hyperparameter tuning process, but the specific strategy to handle this randomness is not mentioned.

It is possible that the authors used techniques such as cross-validation, bootstrapping, or ensemble methods to mitigate the effects of randomness, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given information.
