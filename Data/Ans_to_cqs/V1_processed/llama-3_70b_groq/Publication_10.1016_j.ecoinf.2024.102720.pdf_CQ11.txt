I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of research papers and articles related to various topics such as ecosystem services, agriculture, environmental sustainability, and machine learning. While some of the papers may have used deep learning algorithms, there is no mention of a specific data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
