I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, and mentions the limitations of using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for classification. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
