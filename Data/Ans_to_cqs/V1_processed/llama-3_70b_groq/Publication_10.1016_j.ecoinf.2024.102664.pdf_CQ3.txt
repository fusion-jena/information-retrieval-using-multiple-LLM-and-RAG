I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a research study that uses hybrid deep learning models to forecast algal blooms from satellite data in the Zhoushan fishery. It discusses the structure of the CNN and LSTM models, the adjustment process of the solver for training the network, and the input time series length for the deep learning models. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
