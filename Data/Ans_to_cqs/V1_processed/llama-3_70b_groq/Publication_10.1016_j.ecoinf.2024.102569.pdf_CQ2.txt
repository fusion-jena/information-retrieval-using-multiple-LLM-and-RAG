Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The context discusses ecological informatics, biodiversity information, and statistical models, but it does not mention specific data formats like image, audio, video, or CSV. 

The context does mention data sources such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which are accessible through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). These sources likely provide data in formats such as CSV, JSON, or XML, but this is not explicitly stated. 

Additionally, the context discusses statistical models and equations, which may imply that the data is in a numerical or tabular format, but again, this is not explicitly stated. 

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and more information would be needed to determine the specific data formats used in the pipeline.
