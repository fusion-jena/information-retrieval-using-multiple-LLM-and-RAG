The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The text focuses on the architecture and training of the deep learning model for bird sound classification, but it does not discuss randomness or seed values.

However, it is worth noting that the text does mention the use of the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10âˆ’4, which is a common optimization algorithm used in deep learning. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a batch size of 64 samples and training the network for 200 epochs. These hyperparameters can affect the randomness of the model's performance, but they do not directly address the handling of randomness in the pipeline.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves techniques such as fixing random seeds, using reproducible random number generators, and averaging model performances over multiple runs with different random seeds. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline from the provided context.
