I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles discussing various applications of deep learning in ecology and biology, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
