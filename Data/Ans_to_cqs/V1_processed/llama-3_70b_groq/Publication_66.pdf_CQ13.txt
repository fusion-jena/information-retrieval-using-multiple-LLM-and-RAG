Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that a random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure, and that the number of layers and hidden nodes per layer were varied. However, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
