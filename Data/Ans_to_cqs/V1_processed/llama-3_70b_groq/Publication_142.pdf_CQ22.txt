Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning for species identification, the importance of considering reporting biases, and the details of the Pl@ntNet model, but it does not provide information on the specific evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
