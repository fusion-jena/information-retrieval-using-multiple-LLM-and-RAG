The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions the use of pre-trained CNN models such as AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201 for plant species classification. The text also describes the architecture of a CNN, including the convolutional block, ReLU, and max-pooling layers, and how they are used for feature extraction and classification.
