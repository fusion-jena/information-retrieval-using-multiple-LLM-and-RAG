I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text only describes the methodology and techniques used in the research, including the use of ResNet-50 CNN and SVM classifier, but it does not provide any information about the code repository or a link to access the code. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
