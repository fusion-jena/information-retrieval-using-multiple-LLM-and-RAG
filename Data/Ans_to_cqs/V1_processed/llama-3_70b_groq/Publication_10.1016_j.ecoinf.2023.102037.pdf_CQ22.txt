According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and average precision (AP). Specifically, the precision measures the fraction of the target insects in the detected objects, while the recall measures the fraction of detected target insects from all the target insects within one image. The average precision (AP) is the area under the Precision-Recall (PR) curve for a given IoU threshold, and the mean AP (mAP) is the mean AP for all insect classes in the dataset.
