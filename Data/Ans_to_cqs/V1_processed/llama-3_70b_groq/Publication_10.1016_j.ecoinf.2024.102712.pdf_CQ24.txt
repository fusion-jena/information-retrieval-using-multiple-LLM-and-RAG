I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, forestry, and ecological informatics, with discussions on integrating ICESat-2, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data using a random forest algorithm, forest biomass estimation, and forest attribute mapping. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
