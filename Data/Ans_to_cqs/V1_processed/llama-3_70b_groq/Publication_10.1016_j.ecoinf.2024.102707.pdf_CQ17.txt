The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the model's performance, hyperparameter tuning, and spatial resolutions of the imagery, but it does not specify the regularization methods used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
