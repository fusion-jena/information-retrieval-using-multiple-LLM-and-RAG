Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the YoloV3 model architecture, object detection, and synthetic aperture radar, but it does not provide information about the datasets used.

However, it is mentioned that the authors created their own dataset for the project, which is considered relatively small in size. This dataset is used for object detection in ocean objects using synthetic aperture radar, but its details are not provided.

In summary, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided.
