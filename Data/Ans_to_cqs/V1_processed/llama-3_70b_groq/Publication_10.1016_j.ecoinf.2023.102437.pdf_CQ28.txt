I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. It only discusses the development of the model using Keras (version 2.9.0) and Scikit-Learn packages in Python, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
