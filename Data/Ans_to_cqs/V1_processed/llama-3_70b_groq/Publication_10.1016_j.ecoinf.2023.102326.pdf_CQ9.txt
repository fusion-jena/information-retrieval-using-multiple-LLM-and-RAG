I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the SALVE study, which involves audio recordings from 23 locations in Bochum, Germany, but it does not provide information about where the data is stored or shared. The context mentions references to other studies and standards, but it does not mention specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the data repository based on the provided context.
