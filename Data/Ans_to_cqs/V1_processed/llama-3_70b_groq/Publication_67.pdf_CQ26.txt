The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various deep learning models and techniques used in different applications, such as image classification, object detection, and remote sensing.

Although the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it can be inferred that techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling might be used to address data bias, as they are common techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, there is no explicit mention of these techniques in the provided context.

It is also possible that diverse data collection might be used to address data bias, as the context mentions the use of different datasets, such as Google, Maxar, and NWPU-RESISC45, which could provide diverse data for training deep learning models.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it can be inferred that techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection might be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
