Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on various applications of deep neural networks, including image classification, object detection, and skin cancer diagnosis, as well as discussing techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning. 

However, it is a common practice in machine learning to use validation metrics, such as validation loss or accuracy, to determine when to stop training a model. The idea is to monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop training when the performance metric plateaus or starts to degrade. This is known as early stopping.

In the absence of explicit information in the provided context, I cannot provide a more specific answer.
