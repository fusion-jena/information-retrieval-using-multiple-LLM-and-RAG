The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are bcubed precision, bcubed recall, bcubed F-score, and purity. These metrics are used to compare the performance of feature representations found using Spectral Indices, MFCC, and Auto Encoder over 20 runs using a subset of the total dataset. The average values of these metrics are presented in Table 1, and their variances and standard deviations are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
