I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc. The context only discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate the models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and presents a comparison of different deep learning models, including DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50V2, and their ensembles. It also mentions the use of data augmentation techniques to increase the number of images in the dataset. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the models.
