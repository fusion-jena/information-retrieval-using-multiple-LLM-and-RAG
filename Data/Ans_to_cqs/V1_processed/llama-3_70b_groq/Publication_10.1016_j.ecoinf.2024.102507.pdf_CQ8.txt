I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. It discusses the overall study process, including data processing, model building, compilation, training, and testing, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
