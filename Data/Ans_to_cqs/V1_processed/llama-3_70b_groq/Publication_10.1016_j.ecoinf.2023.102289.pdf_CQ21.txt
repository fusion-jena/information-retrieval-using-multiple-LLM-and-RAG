The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and functionality of LaDeco, a landscape decomposition tool, and its application in various studies.

However, it can be inferred that the model produces a pixel count for 150 objects, and any data that falls below a certain threshold are assigned a value of zero. Then, the percentages of each element and category are calculated based on a visual landscape classification framework. The results are exported in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format.

There is no mention of specific postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. Therefore, it is unclear what postprocessing steps are involved after the model training.
