The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the context, it appears that the model is used for prediction or forecasting. The authors mention that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model is used to analyze the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propagation and that the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set has improved by about 20% compared to the original CNN. This suggests that the model is being used to predict or forecast drought propagation times based on various influencing factors.
