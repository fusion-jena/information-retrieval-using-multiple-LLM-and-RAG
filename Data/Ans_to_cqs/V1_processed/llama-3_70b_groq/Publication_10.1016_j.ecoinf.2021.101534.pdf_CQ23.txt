The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention some techniques that can contribute to the model's generalizability.

For instance, the use of data augmentation techniques, including scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation, can help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting. Additionally, the model's ability to handle input images of size 640 Ã— 640, which is larger than the original spectrogram size, may also contribute to its generalizability.

Furthermore, the context mentions that four original spectrograms were randomly selected, resized, cropped, and color jittered before being merged into one big input image for model training. This process can be seen as a form of data augmentation and may help the model learn to generalize to different spectrogram patterns.

However, without explicit information on cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the diversity of the dataset, it is difficult to conclude the extent to which the model's generalizability was ensured.
