I don't know. The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to ecological and environmental studies, discussing topics like precipitation, climatic suitability, and species distribution modeling. It mentions various statistical and machine learning techniques, such as Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Generalized Linear Models, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
