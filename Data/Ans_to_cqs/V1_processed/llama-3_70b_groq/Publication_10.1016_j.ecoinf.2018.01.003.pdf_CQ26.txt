Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the history and development of neural networks, deep learning, and their applications in various fields. It also provides some mathematical formulations for neural networks, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. However, I can suggest that the mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines. But without further information or context, I cannot provide a more specific answer.
