Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the experimental configurations, training mechanisms, and dataset types used in the study. It mentions the PlantVillage dataset, which is used for training and testing, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the PlantVillage dataset might be a publicly available dataset, as it is used in the experiments. Additionally, the context mentions that the dataset has multiple images of the same leaf taken from different orientations, which suggests that the dataset might have been collected through some form of image capture, such as cameras or sensors. But, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact method of data collection.

In summary, the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, and any further inference would be speculative.
