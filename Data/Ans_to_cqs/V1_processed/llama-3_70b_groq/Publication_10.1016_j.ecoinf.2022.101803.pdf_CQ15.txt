The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on ensemble methods, particularly bagging and boosting, and their application to random forests and gradient-based models. It discusses the importance of ensemble size, regularization, and model averaging for improving out-of-sample generalization performance. However, it does not provide information on optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
