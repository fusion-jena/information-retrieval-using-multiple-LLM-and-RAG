Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing invasive alien species and mitigation of their impacts, and it mentions separating native and alien species pools, categorizing alien species, and counting specimens. There is no mention of deep learning models, normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
