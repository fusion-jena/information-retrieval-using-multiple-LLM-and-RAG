The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. The models mentioned are GLM, GAM, and RF (Random Forest), but not a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, the context does mention a split-sample strategy repeated 100 times with 30% of the data kept aside for validation, which is a form of cross-validation. This suggests that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the models used, but it is not specific to a deep learning model.
