Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors addressed data bias during preprocessing using two techniques: 

1. Evaluating the potential for bias between observers when manually marking landmark points in the FIT interface (observer bias). This was done by having 3 different observers mark the landmark points.

2. Evaluating the use of mirrored right front tracks instead of only left front tracks (foot position bias). This was done by recording the foot position (left-front or right-front) of each track during the feature extraction process.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias in the provided context.
