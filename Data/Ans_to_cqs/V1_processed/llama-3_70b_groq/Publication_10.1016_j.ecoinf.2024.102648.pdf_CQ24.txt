Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on a project related to predicting cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) using machine learning and deep learning models, and it discusses the experimental design, data collection, and various models used for prediction. 

However, it does mention the use of machine learning and deep learning models, including artificial neural networks, bootstrap forest, and boosted tree. These models may inherently involve random initialization of weights or other parameters, but the context does not provide specific information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
