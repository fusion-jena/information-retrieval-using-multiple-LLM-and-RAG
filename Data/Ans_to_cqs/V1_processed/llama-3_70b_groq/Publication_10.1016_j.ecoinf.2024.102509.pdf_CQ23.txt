The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the BP-ANN model used in the study. There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being used to ensure the model's generalizability.

However, it is mentioned that the selection of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial and error, aiming to optimize the network's structure. Additionally, the study used a validation dataset to analyze the relative effectiveness of the model, which suggests that some form of model evaluation was performed. But the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
