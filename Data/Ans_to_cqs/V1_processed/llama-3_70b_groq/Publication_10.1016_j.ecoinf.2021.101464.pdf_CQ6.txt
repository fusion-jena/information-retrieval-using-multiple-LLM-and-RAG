The provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context discusses the application of multiple linear regression and random forest models to analyze the influence of environmental factors on NAI (Nitrogen Absorption Index). It does not provide information on deep learning models or preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

The context focuses on the parameter optimization results of the random forest model, the importance scores of variables, and the comparison of results between multiple linear regression and random forest models. It does not provide any information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
