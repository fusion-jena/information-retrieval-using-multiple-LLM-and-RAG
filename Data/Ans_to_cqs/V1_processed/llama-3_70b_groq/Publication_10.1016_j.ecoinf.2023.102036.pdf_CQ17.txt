Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the limitations of the dataset size and the use of existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals to overcome these limitations. It also mentions various research papers and techniques related to deep learning, image data augmentation, and fish species classification. However, it does not provide specific information about regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
