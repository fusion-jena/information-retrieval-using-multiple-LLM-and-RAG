Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on ecological informatics, land use/land cover classification, and forest type classification using machine learning models like XGBoost. It also mentions other machine learning models and techniques, such as ABC-ANFIS, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting, but does not discuss handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
