I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the architecture types, such as Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but does not provide information about the framework used to implement these architectures. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
