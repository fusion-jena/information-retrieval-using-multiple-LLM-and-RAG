I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses machine learning methods, specifically Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks, in the context of modeling growth in forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It does not provide information on handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or mention random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
