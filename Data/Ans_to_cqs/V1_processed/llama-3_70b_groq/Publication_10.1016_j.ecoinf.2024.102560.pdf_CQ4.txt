I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Lake Urmia, discussing topics such as river runoff variation, signal decomposition, and the use of datasets like CMAP and Landsat satellite images. There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
