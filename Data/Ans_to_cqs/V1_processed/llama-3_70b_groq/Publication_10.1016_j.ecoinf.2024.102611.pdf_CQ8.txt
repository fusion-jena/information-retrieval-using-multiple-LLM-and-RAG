I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various aspects of plant species classification using machine learning and deep learning techniques, but it does not provide any information about the code implementation or repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
