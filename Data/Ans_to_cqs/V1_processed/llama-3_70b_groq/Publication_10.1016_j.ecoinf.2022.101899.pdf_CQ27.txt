Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the research papers and reports related to wildfire event predictions, forest health monitoring, and bushfire fuel management, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
