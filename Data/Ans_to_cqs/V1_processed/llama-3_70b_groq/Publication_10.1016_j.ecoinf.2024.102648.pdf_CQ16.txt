According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation statistic, specifically the R2 value for a continuous response. This is mentioned in the section 2.7. Early stopping, which states that the process stops growing additional trees/layers/split when further addition of more trees/layers/split does not improve the validation statistic. This implies that the training is complete when the validation loss plateaus, i.e., when the R2 value stops improving.
