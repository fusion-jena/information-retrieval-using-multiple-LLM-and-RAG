I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on air quality, pollution, and related research studies, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The papers cited in the context discuss various topics such as predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM, air pollution in central European capital, assessing nitrogen dioxide levels, and more, but they do not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
