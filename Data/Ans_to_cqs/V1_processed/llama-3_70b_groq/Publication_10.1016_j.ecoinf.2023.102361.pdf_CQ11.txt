The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a Github repository link (https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets) shared by Jiang et al. (2020) for the dataset used in the research. This link is not a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline, but rather a link to the dataset used in the research. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not provided in the context.
