I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper discussing ecological corridors, species migration, and landscape composition, with references to specific research methods and tools such as SOFM, kohonen, and Getis-Ord Gi*. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
