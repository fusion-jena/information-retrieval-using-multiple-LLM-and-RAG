Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors and vision-based systems are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, Zhong et al. (2018) propose a "vision-based counting and recognition system for flying insects in intelligent agriculture." This suggests that cameras or other visual sensors are used to collect data on insects in agricultural settings.

Additionally, Kamilaris et al. (2016) discuss the concept of "Agri-IoT: A semantic framework for internet of things-enabled smart farming applications," which implies the use of IoT sensors in agricultural settings to collect data.

However, the context does not provide explicit information on the use of surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that these methods may be used, but it is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that sensors and vision-based systems are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, but the use of surveys and public datasets is unclear.
