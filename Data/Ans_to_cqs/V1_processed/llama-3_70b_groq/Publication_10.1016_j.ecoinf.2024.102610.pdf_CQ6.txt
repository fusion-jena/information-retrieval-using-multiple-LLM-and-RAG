The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on machine learning techniques, specifically random forests, and feature elimination methods for predicting disease vectors. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of creating a mask to delineate the "area of applicability" for the trained model, which might be related to data preprocessing. Additionally, the context discusses the use of variable elimination techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model performance, which could be indirectly related to preprocessing.

But, unfortunately, the context does not provide explicit information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
