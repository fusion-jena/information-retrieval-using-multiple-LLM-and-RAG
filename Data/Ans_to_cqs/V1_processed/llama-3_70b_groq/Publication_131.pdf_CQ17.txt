Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20% as tests, which is a common strategy to enhance the generalization of a machine learning model and prevent overfitting. However, it does not specify any regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
