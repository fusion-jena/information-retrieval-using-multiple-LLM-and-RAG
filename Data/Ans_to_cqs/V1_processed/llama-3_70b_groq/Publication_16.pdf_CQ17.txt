According to the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. Specifically, a dropout value of 50% has been used in the first three layers to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods being used in the pipeline.
