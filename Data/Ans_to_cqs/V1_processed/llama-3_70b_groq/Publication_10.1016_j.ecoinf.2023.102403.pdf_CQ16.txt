I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a research paper or article in the field of ecological informatics, and it does not mention training or validation loss plateau. The text discusses data curation, filtering, and cleaning of occurrence data from GBIF and OBIS, and presents tables with various statistics and criteria for filtering data. There is no mention of machine learning or training, which is where the concept of validation loss plateau would typically be relevant. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
