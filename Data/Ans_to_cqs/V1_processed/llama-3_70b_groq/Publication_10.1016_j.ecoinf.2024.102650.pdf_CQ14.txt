Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context explains the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, its basic idea, and its application in topic modeling, but it does not provide information about hyperparameter optimization. 

The context mentions the use of Python's pyLDAvis Library for clustering and visualizing topics, but it does not discuss hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in this specific study.
