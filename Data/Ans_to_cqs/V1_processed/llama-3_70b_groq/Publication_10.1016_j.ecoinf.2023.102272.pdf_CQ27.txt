I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the model selection procedure, including generating and training candidate models, comparing their accuracy, and selecting the best-performing model. It also provides information about the parameters tested and values for each classical machine learning model used and each test year. However, it does not provide any information about deploying the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
