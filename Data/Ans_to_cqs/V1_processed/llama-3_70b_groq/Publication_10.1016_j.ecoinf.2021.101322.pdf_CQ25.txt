The purpose of the deep learning model is regression, specifically age prediction. This can be inferred from the performance metrics used to assess the model, such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean average percentage error (MAPE), which are commonly used in regression tasks. Additionally, the accuracy metric is calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it with the ground truth, further supporting the idea that the model is performing a regression task.
