I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data extraction, preprocessing, and analysis of hiking trail data from Wikiloc, including text translation, tokenization, lemmatization, and word frequency counting. It also mentions the use of Word2vec for semantic analysis, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
