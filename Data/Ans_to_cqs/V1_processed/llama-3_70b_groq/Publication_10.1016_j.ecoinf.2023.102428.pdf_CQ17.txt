Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the MLPnn-MC model, its architecture, and its application in LULC simulation. It discusses the MLP algorithm, its layers, and the backpropagation method used for training, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used in this particular deep learning pipeline, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
