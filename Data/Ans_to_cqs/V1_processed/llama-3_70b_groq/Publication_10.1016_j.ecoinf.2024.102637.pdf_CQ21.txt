Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training process, and optimization techniques used to improve the model's performance and efficiency. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix, that are typically performed after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
