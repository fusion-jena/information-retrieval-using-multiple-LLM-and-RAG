Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the classification network, the evaluation metrics, and the experimental setup. It does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
