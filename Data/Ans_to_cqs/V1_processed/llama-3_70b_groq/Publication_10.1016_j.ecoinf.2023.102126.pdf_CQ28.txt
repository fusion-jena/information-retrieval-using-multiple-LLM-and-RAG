I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) being used to deploy a model. The context appears to be related to data sharing, repositories, and research data management, but it does not provide any information about a specific deep learning model or its deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
