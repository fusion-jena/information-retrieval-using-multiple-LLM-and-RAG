I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be a research paper on land use/land cover classification using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms. The paper mentions that supplementary data can be found online at a specific DOI (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101955), but it does not specify a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
