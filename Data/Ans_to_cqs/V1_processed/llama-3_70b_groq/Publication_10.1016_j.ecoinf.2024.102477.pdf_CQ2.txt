The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically SLSTM, in time-series prediction and forecasting. It discusses the use of SLSTM in predicting agricultural product sales and the Pacific decadal oscillation index, but it does not provide information about the data formats used in these applications.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be time-series data, possibly in CSV or similar formats, as the context mentions seasonal decomposition and forecasting. But this is only an inference, and the exact data formats used are not specified in the provided context.
