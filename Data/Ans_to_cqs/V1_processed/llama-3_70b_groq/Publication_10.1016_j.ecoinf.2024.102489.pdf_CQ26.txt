The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention some preprocessing techniques used to ensure the quality of the training samples.

For instance, the context mentions the use of pixel quality control metrics of MODIS products to eliminate cloud-contaminated and poor-quality pixels and remove outliers from the training samples. Additionally, it mentions the use of purity screening to ensure that adjacent pixels of the same land cover type have similar surface reflectance or LAI and have enough MODIS pixels.

While these techniques are not directly related to addressing data bias, they do contribute to improving the quality and representativeness of the training data. However, the context does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
