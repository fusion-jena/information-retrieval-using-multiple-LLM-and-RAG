I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a survey or questionnaire about data analytics and smart farming, and it does not provide information about the training process or its completion criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
