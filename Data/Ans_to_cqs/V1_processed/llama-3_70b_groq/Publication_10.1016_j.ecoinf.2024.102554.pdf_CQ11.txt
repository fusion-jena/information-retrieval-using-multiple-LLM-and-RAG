I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions a README.md file in the repository, but it does not provide the link to the repository itself. The context appears to be focused on describing the data sources, instruments, and parameters used in the study, but it does not provide information about the repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
