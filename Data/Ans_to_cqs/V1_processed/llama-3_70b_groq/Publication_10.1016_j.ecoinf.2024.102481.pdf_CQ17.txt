The provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) machine learning method for classification of reproductive condition in fish, but it does not mention deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
