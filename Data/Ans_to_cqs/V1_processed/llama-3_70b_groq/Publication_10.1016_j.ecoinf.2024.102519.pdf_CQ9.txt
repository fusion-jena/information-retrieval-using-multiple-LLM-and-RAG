I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and provides information about data sources, characteristics, and funding, but it does not mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The mentioned data sources are mostly Chinese institutions and websites, such as the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center, but none of them are mentioned as a repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
