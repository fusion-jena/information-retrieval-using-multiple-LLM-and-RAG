The context mentions two types of deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). However, it does not specify which one is used in the pipeline. CNNs are mentioned as being highly effective for LULC classification, while RNNs are mentioned as being able to learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns continuously. There is no mention of Transformers. Therefore, the answer is that the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly specified, but CNNs and RNNs are mentioned as being relevant for LULC classification.
