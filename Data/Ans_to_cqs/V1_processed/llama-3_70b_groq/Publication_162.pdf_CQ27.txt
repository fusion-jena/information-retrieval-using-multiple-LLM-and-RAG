I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references to various research papers and articles related to computer vision, machine learning, and image analysis. It discusses topics such as part detector discovery, species classification, and novelty detection, but it does not provide information on how to deploy a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
