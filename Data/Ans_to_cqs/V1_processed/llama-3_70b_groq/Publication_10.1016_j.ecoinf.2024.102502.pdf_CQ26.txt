The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data filtering, scaling, and workflow replicability in the context of environmental time series data. It discusses scaling domains, pre-modelling scaling protocols, and trade-offs in data extraction, but does not touch on data bias or deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection) are not discussed in the context, and it's unclear how they relate to the specific pipeline or data being processed.
