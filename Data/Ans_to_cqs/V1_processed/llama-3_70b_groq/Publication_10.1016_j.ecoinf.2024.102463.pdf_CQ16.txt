The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the hyperparameter optimization process, model training, and evaluation metrics (MAE and NSE), but it does not specify a stopping criterion for the training process.

It is possible that the training process is completed when the optimization algorithm converges or reaches a certain number of iterations, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
