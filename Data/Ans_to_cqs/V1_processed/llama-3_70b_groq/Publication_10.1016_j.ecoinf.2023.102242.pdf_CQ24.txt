The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to object-oriented random forest classification for land type classification, discussing the evaluation results of classification accuracy in 2020 and 2021. It mentions the use of random forest classification and nearest neighbor classification methods, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or setting random seed values.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
