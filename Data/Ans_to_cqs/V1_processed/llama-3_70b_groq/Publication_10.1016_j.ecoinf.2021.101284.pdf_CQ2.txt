Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline involves image data, specifically X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images, as mentioned in the reference "Castillo, O., 2020. Early diagnosis of covid-19-affected patients based on x-ray and computed tomography images using deep learning algorithm."

There is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV in the context. However, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a numerical format, given the discussion of standardization and normalization of data in the "Materials and methods" section.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely image data, specifically X-ray and CT images.
