Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of Root Mean Squared (RMS) error. The table provides two RMS values: Training RMS (0.1430) and Testing RMS (0.1446). These values indicate the model's performance on the training and testing datasets, respectively. The Acceptable RMS value is set to 0.01, which suggests that the model's performance is considered acceptable if the RMS error is below this threshold. This implies that the model's performance is being monitored during training by tracking the RMS error and stopping the training process when the error reaches an acceptable level.
