None of the provided context mentions the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The machine learning models mentioned in the context are Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), which are traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
