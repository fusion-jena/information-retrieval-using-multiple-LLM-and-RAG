Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the effects of sample size and network depth on a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
