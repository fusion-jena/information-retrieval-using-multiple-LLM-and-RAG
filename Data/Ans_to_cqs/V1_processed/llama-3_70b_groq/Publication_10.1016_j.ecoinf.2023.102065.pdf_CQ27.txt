Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and fine-tuning of the CNN models using acoustic reference data and ROI data from the study site. It discusses the data preparation, sampling, and validation process, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
