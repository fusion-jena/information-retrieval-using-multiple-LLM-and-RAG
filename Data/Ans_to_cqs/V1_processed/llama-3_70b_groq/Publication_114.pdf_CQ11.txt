I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning approaches for tree species classification, presents a flowchart for the identification of tree species, and provides classification accuracies of three deep learning algorithms. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
