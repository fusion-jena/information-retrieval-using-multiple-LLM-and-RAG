The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing a model for predicting real-world phenomena like wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, taking into account variables like temperature and humidity. There is no mention of image datasets or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
