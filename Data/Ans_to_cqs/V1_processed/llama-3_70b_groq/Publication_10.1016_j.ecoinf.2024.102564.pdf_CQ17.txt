I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests, but it does not provide information on regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
