Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically LSTM, in predicting air quality and pollution levels. It discusses various studies that utilized these models to forecast PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 levels, but it does not delve into the details of model generalizability measures. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
