The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained and evaluated on two different datasets (GBIF Natural and GBIF Preserved) to compare the performance of different model setups. This could be seen as a form of dataset diversification, but it is not explicitly stated as a measure to ensure generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that all results are averaged over three repetitions, which could imply some form of cross-validation or repeated evaluation, but the exact methodology is not specified.

It is also worth noting that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset, and then fine-tuned on the plant cover data. This could help improve the model's generalizability, but again, it is not explicitly stated as a measure to ensure generalizability.

In summary, while the context provides some hints about the evaluation and training procedures, it does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
