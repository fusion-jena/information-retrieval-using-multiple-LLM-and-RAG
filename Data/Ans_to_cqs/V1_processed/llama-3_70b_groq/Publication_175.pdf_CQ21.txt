The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the training of different deep learning (DL) and few-shots learning (FSL) models on various datasets, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps performed after training.

However, it is mentioned that the models were tested on an independent dataset T2, and the results of experiments 1 and 2 were compared to estimate the decrease in performance of a classic ResNet DL architecture when trained on a large dataset versus a more limited dataset. This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation may have been performed, but the specific details are not provided.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as whether saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices were used.
