The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the classification of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) using different machine learning algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF).

However, it can be inferred that the input data used for training the ANN model consists of band reflectance values, which are likely to be the output of some preprocessing steps. But the context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, that were applied to the data before training the model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in this context.
