Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the EfficientDet model, its architecture, and its performance on the MS COCO dataset. It also mentions other models and their performances on seagrass coverage estimation tasks, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
