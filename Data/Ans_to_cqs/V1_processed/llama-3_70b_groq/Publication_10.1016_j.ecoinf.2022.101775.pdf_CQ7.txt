The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "we trained algorithms with the amount of data available after manually removing the testing set" and "10% of data served as the validation set to check for overfitting." This implies that the data was split into three sets: training, testing, and validation. The exact criteria or ratio used for splitting the data are not specified.
