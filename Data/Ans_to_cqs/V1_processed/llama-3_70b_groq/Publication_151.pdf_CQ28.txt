The context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was implemented using PyTorch and trained on 2080Ti NVIDIA GPUs. It does not provide information about the cloud platform or infrastructure used for deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
