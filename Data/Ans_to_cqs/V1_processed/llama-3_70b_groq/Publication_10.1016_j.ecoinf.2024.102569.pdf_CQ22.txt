The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any metrics used to evaluate its performance, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The context appears to be discussing a statistical model, specifically a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty, and a root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) used to select tuning parameters. There is no mention of deep learning or any related evaluation metrics. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
