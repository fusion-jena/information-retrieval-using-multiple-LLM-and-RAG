The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the tables and figures presented, it can be inferred that the performance of the models (MLR, RF, SVM, XGboost, and MLP) is evaluated using metrics such as R2, RMSE, and REP. 

These metrics are calculated for both the training set and validation set, which suggests that the models are trained and validated using a split of the available data. This is a common strategy to monitor model performance during training, as it allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data and helps to prevent overfitting.

However, the specific strategy or technique used to implement this monitoring process, such as early stopping or learning rate scheduling, is not mentioned in the provided context.
