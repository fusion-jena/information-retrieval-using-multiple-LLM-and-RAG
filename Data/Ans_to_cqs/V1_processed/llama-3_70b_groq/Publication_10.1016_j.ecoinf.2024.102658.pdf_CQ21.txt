The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It primarily focuses on the iterative model exploration process, feature selection, and model evaluation using cross-validation techniques. 

However, it can be inferred that the authors have calculated numerical scores for the models, as mentioned in the text, and have presented visualizations and scores in Figs. 3, 4, and B.11. The authors also mention that they have performed diagnoses of problems, if any, but the specific postprocessing steps involved are not detailed.

Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices were used as postprocessing steps.
