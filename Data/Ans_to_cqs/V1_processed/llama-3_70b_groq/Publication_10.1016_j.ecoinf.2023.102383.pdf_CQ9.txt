I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article discussing the use of Faster R-CNN and ResNet models for object detection in drone thermal imagery, specifically for deer surveys. The article provides information on the models used, their performance, and comparisons with other studies, but it does not mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
