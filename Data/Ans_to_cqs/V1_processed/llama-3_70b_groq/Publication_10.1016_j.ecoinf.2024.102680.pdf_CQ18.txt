The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using the common objects in context evaluation metrics, as mentioned in section 3.2. These metrics are described in Table 1, but the table is not provided in the context. 

It is also mentioned in section 2.2.1 that the preprocessing steps in the input layer "improving the model performance during training". This suggests that the model performance is being monitored or evaluated during training, but the specific strategy or metrics used for monitoring are not clearly stated.
