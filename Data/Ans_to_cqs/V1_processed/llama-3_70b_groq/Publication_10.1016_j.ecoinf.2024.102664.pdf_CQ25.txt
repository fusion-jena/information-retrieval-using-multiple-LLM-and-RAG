The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is regression. The model is designed to forecast algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery using satellite data. The output layer of both the CNN and LSTM models is a regression output layer, which suggests that the model is intended to predict a continuous value, such as the concentration of chlorophyll. The evaluation metric used to measure the performance of the model is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which is commonly used in regression tasks. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model is to make a continuous prediction, rather than classification, segmentation, or detection.
