Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Absolute error
2. Relative error
3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
4. Standard deviation

These metrics are used to compare the performance of the BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) models in predicting the actual value of ten thousand acres. The results show that the SVM model outperforms the BPNN model, with a lower absolute error, relative error, and RMSE, and a smaller standard deviation.

Note that accuracy, precision, and recall are not mentioned in the provided context as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model.
