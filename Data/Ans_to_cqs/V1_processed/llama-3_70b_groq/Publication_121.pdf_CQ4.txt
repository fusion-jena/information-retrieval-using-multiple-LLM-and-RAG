The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on transfer learning, feature extraction, and fine-tuning of pre-trained models for leaf classification tasks. It discusses the advantages of transfer learning, the process of feature extraction, and the fine-tuning of models using pre-trained weights. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
