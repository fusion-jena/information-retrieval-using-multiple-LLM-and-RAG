The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the prediction flow and the calculation of the prediction error. 

According to the context, after obtaining the weight wm using the training dataset Dm, the prediction from time tm using the signature xm yields the value ̂ym+ma, which is compared with the validation data ym+ma. The prediction error is then obtained by calculating ̂ym+ma - ym+ma at different starting times.

There is no mention of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. It is possible that these steps are not relevant to the specific model or experiment being described, or they may be omitted from the provided context.
