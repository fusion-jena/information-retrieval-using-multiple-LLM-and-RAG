I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to a study on land use/cover changes and their impact on the environment, with formulas and equations describing the calculation of GSN (Global Sensitivity Number) changes. There is no mention of deep learning models, datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
