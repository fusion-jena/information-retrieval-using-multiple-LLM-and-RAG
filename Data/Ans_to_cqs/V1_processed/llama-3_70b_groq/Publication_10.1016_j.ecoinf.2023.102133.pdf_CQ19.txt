The framework used to build the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the models were implemented using the scikit-learn library, which is an open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language. Scikit-learn is primarily used for traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models. It does not support building deep learning models like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model (Multi-Layer Perceptron) was likely built using a different library or framework, but the specific framework is not mentioned in the provided context.
