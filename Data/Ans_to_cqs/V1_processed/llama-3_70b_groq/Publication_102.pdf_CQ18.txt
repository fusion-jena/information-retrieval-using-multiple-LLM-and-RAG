The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the early stopping technique. This is mentioned in the "Training" section, which states: "Based on the model's performance on the validation set, the early stopping technique was applied to avoid over-fitting." This means that the model's performance was monitored on the validation set during training, and when the performance stopped improving, the training was stopped to prevent over-fitting.
