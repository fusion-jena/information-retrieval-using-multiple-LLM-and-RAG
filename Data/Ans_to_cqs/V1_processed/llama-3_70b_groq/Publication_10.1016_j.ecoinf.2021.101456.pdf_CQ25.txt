The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but based on the provided information, it appears to be related to unsupervised learning tasks, specifically clustering. The model is a variant of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) called dynamic Î²-VAE, which is used for representation learning. The evaluation metrics used, such as ARI and AMI scores, are commonly used to quantify the performance of clustering algorithms. Additionally, the text mentions that the model is used to identify groups, which further supports the idea that the purpose of the model is clustering.
