The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text primarily focuses on Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and their properties, as well as the GRELMA algorithm for clustering. It does not discuss optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
