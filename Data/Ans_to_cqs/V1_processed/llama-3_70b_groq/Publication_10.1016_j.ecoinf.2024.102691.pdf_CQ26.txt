Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, attention mechanisms, and depth map processing. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the given context.
