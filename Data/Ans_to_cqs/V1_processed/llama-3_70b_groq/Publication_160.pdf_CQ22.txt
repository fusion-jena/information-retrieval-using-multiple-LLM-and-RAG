The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, F1-score, macro-F1, micro-F1, and top-1 accuracy. These metrics are computed at both micro and macro levels. Micro-F1, precision, and recall are computed across all classes, given their distribution on the whole dataset, while macro statistics place equal weight on all classes, meaning that class-wise differences in performance more greatly impact the scores.
