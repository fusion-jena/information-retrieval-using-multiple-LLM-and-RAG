Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the performance comparison of different deep learning models for image-based species classification of birds, and it discusses the challenges of collecting and working with bird image data. It mentions that deep learning algorithms require large amounts of labeled data to train effectively, but it does not specify how this data is collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods.
