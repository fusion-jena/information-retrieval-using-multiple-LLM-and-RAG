Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on cross-validation techniques, model evaluation, and performance metrics in various domains like waste management, water resource management, and environmental modeling. It discusses the importance of cross-validation in assessing the performance and generalization capability of machine learning models, but it does not delve into regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
