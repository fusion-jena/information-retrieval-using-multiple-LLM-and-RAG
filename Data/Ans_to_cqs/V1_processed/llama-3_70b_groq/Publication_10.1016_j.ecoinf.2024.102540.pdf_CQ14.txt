The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It only mentions that initial computational experiments were conducted with different combinations of epochs (300, 400, and 500) and batch sizes (8, 16, and 32) to determine the optimal hyperparameters, which were found to be 400 epochs with a batch size of 8. However, it does not specify whether a grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
