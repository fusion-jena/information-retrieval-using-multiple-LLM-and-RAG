I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the development of deep learning methodologies, the collection and labeling of a fish dataset in turbid waters, and the training of two novel deep learning models using semi-supervised contrastive learning and weakly-supervised learning. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs.
