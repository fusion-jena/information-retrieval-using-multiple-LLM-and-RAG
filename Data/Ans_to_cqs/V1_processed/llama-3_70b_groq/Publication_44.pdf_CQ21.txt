Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer some possible steps based on the information provided.

One possible postprocessing step is the calculation of metrics, as shown in Table 9, which presents the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for different models, including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5s, and the Proposed Method. This suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved.

Another possible postprocessing step is the selection of the best-performing model based on the validation loss, as mentioned in the text. This implies that model selection is a postprocessing step.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) with a threshold of 0.7 during testing, which is a common postprocessing step in object detection tasks.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps. Therefore, it is unclear whether these steps are involved in the model's postprocessing pipeline.

In summary, while the exact postprocessing steps are not explicitly stated, metrics calculation, model selection, and NMS are likely involved. However, the involvement of saliency maps and confusion matrices is unclear.
