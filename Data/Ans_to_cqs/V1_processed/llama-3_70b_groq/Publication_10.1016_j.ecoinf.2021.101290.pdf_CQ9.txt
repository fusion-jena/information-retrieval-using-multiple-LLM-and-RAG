I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and quotes from various papers and sources, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository. The mentioned tools and platforms, such as AWS Kinesis, Apache Kibana, and Elasticsearch, are related to event-stream processing and machine learning, but they are not data repositories. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
