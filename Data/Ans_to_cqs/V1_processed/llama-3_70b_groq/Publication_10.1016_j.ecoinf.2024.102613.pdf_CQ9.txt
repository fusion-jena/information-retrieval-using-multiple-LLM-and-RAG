I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is stored. The text discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques in smart farming and precision agriculture, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository. The context mentions the Scopus database as a source for collecting papers, but it does not indicate that the data repository is available there. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
