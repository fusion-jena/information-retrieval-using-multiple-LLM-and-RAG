The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that "the training of Pl@ntNet CNN requires the mobilization of a high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep, distributed, and large-scale learning." This suggests that some form of high-performance computing infrastructure is used, but it does not provide details on whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources are used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
