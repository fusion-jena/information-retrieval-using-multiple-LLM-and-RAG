I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The abstracts and author contributions mention the use of deep learning techniques, such as Faster R-CNN, and the annotation of herbarium scans, but they do not provide a link to a code repository like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
