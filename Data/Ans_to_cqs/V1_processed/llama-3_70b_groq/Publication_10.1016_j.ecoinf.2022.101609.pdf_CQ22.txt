The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), as well as mean absolute error. These metrics are mentioned in Section 4.3.3, Model evaluation, as the top metrics for regression problems. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall, which are typically used for classification problems.
