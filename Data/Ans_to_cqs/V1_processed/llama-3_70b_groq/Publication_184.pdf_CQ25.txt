The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection. Specifically, it is designed to detect fish in images and provide their bounding box coordinates. This is evident from the fact that the model is trained with annotated data that includes the class of the object (fish) and its bounding box data, such as x, y coordinates, width, and height. The model used is YOLO (You Only Look Once), which is a popular object detection algorithm. The model's performance is evaluated based on its precision, recall, and mean average precision, which are common metrics used in object detection tasks.
