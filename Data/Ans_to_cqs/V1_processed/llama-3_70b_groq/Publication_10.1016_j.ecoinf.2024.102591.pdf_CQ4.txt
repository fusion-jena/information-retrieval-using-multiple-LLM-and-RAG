I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for wildfire science, the implementation of workflows for fire scar delineation, and the use of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) regression for FCOVER retrieval. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
