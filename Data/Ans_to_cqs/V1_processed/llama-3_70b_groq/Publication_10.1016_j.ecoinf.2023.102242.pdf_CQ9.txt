I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is stored. The context discusses the processing of high-resolution remote sensing data, feature optimization tools, and multi-scale segmentation, but it does not provide information about the data repository. The references cited in the context are academic papers and theses, but they do not provide a link to a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
