The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Neural Network with Dense layers. Specifically, it is a Bayesian Deep Learning model, which is a type of neural network that uses Bayesian inference to model uncertainty. The architecture consists of an input layer, two hidden layers with 32 nodes each, and an output layer that predicts the parameters of a Gaussian distribution. There is no indication of the use of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
