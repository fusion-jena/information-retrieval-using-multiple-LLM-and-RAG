I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The references cited are mostly related to research papers and academic publications, and they do not provide information about the deployment platform. The context only mentions the use of Keras, which is a deep learning library, but it does not specify the underlying platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model based on the provided context.
