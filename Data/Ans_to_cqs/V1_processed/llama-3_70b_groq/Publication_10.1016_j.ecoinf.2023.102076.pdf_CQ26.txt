Based on the provided context, it appears that stratification and oversampling are two techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Stratification is mentioned in the context of training data, where it is stated that stratification of training data influenced the performance of classifiers in identifying relevant texts in testing data. Specifically, classifiers trained on stratified data performed better than those trained on non-stratified data.

Oversampling is also mentioned as a technique to alleviate the issue of imbalanced training data, where the target class makes up a small proportion of the text. It is stated that augmenting training data by oversampling the minority class can help to address this issue.

There is no mention of undersampling or diverse data collection as techniques to address data bias in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques are used in this specific pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, stratification and oversampling are two techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
