The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models. It discusses the use of traditional machine learning techniques such as CART, RF, GTB, and SVM within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. 

However, it can be inferred that the generalizability of the models was ensured by using a validation dataset for hyperparameter tuning. This is mentioned in the context as "To fill this gap and avoid overfitting, the validation data were employed for tuning the key hyperparameters for each model." 

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. The context only provides information about the hyperparameters set for each model during training and validation, but it does not provide details about the dataset used or the measures taken to ensure generalizability.
