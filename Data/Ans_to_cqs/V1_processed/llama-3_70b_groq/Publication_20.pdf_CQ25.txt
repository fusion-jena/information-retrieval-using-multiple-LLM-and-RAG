The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is designed to identify fish species from thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species, and environment. The model outputs the most likely fish class, and the raw outputs are post-processed to refine the classification results. The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing its classification accuracy with that of humans.
