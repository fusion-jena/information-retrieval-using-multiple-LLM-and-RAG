Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on water quality management, environmental pollution, and the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in these areas. While it mentions the use of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Generalized Additive models, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved in training these models.

However, in general, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. Normalization involves scaling the input features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming the input features to a common scale, such as standardization or min-max scaling. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming the most relevant features to improve the model's performance.

It is likely that these preprocessing steps are involved in the deep learning models mentioned in the context, but without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific steps used.
