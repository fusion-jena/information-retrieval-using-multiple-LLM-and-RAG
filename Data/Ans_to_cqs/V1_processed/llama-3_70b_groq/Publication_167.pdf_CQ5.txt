The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the use of a deep learning model for land use and land cover change (LUCC) analysis, but it does not mention specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Instead, the context mentions a custom dataset consisting of a grid with neighborhood features, including land use type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables, collected over six years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013).
