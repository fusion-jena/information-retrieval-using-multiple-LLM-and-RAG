The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The TensorFlow configuration mentioned in the context only adjusts two parameters: validation percentage and number of training steps. There is no mention of handling randomness or setting a random seed value.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
