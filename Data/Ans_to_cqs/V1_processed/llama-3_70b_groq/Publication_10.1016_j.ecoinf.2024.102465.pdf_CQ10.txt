I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of HRNet model and PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing, but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The references cited in the text are academic papers and do not provide a link to a code repository either. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
