Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on species distribution models (SDMs) and discusses a new loss function, a multi-species neural network model, and an evaluation methodology. It mentions that the approach is applicable to diverse datasets, but it does not specify which datasets are used in the experiments. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
