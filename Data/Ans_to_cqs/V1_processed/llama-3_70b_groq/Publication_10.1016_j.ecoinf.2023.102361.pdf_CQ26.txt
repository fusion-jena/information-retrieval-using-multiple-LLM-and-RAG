The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques as a way to increase the number of training data, which can help address issues related to data bias. 

The context mentions that many studies use data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training data, which generally improves the classification accuracy. However, it does not specify which techniques are used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
