I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be discussing a process for selecting and filtering specimens for a study on invasive species, including the use of herbarium labels and geo-coordinates from Google Maps. There is no mention of a data repository or a deep learning pipeline, so it is not possible to determine where the data repository is available.
