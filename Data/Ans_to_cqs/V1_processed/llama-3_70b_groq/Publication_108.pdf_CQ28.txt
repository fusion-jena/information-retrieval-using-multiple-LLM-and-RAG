I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the workflow of preprocessing, network design, and prediction, as well as the architecture of the CNN and comparisons with other classification methods. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
