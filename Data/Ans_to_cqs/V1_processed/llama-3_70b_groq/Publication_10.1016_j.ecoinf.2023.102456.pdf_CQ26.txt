Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on forest fires, machine learning, and neural networks, but it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques.

However, I can provide some general information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. These include:

* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution
* Oversampling: creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution
* Undersampling: reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the class distribution
* Diverse data collection: collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias and increase representation

These techniques can help mitigate data bias and improve the performance of deep learning models. However, without specific information from the provided context, I cannot provide a more tailored answer.
