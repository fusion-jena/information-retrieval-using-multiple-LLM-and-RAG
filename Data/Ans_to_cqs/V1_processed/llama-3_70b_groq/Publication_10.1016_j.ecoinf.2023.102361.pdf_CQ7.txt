According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on a random division of the datasets into three parts: training, validation, and testing. Specifically, 60% of the data is used for training the deep learning models, 20% is kept for validation, and the remaining 20% is used to evaluate the performance of the models.
