I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to a study on Amur tigers and leopards, discussing topics like classification accuracy, holdback trials, and test set sizes. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
