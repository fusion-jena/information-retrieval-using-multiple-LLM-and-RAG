Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from satellite and aerial RGB images. Specifically, the context mentions that a global database of very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images was compiled from two sources. Additionally, the context references the use of Google Maps, Maxar, and NWPU-RESISC45 dataset, which suggests that the raw data is collected from remote sensing sources.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for collecting raw data. However, it is possible that the satellite and aerial images are collected through sensors on satellites or aerial vehicles.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of FAO's GDA photointerpreted very high resolution plots, which may suggest that some form of human interpretation or annotation is involved in the data collection process.

Overall, based on the provided context, it appears that the primary method of collecting raw data for the deep learning pipeline is through remote sensing sources such as satellite and aerial images.
