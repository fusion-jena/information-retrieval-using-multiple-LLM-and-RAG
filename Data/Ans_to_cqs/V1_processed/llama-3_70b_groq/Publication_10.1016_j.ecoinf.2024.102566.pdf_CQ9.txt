I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The text appears to be a research article discussing the estimation of forest biomass density in the Qinba Mountains using remote sensing imagery and forest inventory data. It cites several references and provides information about the methodology and results of the study, but it does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
