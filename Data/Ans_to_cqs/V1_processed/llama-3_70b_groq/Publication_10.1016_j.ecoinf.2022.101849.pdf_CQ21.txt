I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on weakly supervised learning tasks, different types of weak labels, and the performance of predictive models. It discusses the importance of using incompletely labeled data in model training and presents experimental results comparing the performance of different approaches. However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps after model training.
