I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the research purpose, methodology, and results of the animal classification project using deep learning and edge analytics, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) where the data is stored.
