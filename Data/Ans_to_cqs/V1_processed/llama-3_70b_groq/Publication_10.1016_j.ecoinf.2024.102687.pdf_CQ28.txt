I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the energy consumption of training different CNN backbones, the use of meta-learning algorithms, and the importance of considering the ecological impact of large-scale computing in ecoacoustics. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
