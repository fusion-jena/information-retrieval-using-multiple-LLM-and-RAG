I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses various aspects of deep learning models, such as spectral normalization, activation functions, output sizes, and convolutional kernels, as well as data augmentation and attention mechanisms. It also references several research papers and datasets, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
