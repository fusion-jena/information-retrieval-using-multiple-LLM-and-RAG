The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. It only states that "Model hyperparameters are implemented based on the recommendation outlined by the model authors." This suggests that the hyperparameters were chosen based on the recommendations provided by the authors of the ResNet-50, AST, and HuBERT models, but the specific values are not specified. Therefore, I don't know the exact hyperparameters used in the model.
