I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The references cited are mostly academic papers, preprints, and websites, but none of them appear to be a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
