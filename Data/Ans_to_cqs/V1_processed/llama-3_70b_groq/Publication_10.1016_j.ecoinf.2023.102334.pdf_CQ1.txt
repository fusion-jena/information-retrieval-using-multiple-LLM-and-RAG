Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of computer vision techniques, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT), for facial recognition of sika deer. It discusses the architecture and performance of the model, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, it is worth noting that the context cites some references related to wildlife surveillance and precision livestock farming, which might imply that data collection methods could involve sensors, cameras, or other monitoring systems. Additionally, the reference to "wildlife surveillance using deep learning methods" (Chen et al., 2019) might suggest that data collection involves camera traps or other forms of visual monitoring.

Despite these hints, the context does not provide a clear answer to the query. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
