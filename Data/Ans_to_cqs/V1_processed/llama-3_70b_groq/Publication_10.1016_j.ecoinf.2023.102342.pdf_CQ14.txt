The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the Apriori algorithm, which is a data mining technique used to identify frequent itemsets, and its application to identify recurring patterns in association rules. It also mentions the importance of setting a minimum support threshold, but it does not discuss model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
