I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and components of different neural networks, such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, as well as the performance of the hybrid deep neural network model (BivalveNet) on a specific task. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
