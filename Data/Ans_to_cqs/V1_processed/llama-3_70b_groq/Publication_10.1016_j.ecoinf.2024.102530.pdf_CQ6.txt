Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) model for Apis habitat suitability, and it discusses the rules and membership functions used in the model. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
