I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses various components of the model, such as the CSMB and LKSP modules, and compares the performance of different models, including YOLOv8s and UODN. However, it does not provide information about the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, was used to build the deep learning model.
