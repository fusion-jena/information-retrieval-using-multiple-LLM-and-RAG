Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on remote sensing and land-use and land-cover classification. Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data are likely related to remote sensing technologies.

Although the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that satellite or aerial imagery is used as the primary source of data. This is because the context mentions the use of Sentinel-1 SAR time series and optical remote sensing images.

Additionally, the context mentions Google Earth Engine, which is a platform that provides access to a vast repository of remote sensing data, including satellite and aerial imagery. This suggests that the raw data is likely collected through satellite or aerial sensors.

It is also possible that public datasets are used, as the context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine, which provides access to public datasets. However, the context does not provide explicit information on the use of surveys or other methods for collecting raw data.

In summary, based on the context, it can be inferred that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are likely related to remote sensing technologies, including satellite or aerial sensors, and public datasets such as those provided by Google Earth Engine.
