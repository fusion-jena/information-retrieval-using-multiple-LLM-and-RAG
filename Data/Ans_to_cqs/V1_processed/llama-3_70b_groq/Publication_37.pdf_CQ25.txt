The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used for large-vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls. The model is trained on a dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species and is evaluated based on its classification accuracy. The goal is to automatically classify migrating birds' flight calls to their corresponding species, which can contribute to monitoring biodiversity and have applications in ecology and conservation.
