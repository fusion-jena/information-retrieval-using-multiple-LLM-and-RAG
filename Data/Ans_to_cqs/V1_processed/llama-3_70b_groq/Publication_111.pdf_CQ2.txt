The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the fact that the dataset is obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency and is used to predict Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH), it can be inferred that the data is likely in a numerical format, such as CSV or a similar tabular format. The context does not suggest the use of image, audio, or video data formats.
