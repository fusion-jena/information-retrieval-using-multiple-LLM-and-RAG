Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including the mini-batch size, GPU memory limitations, and the use of ResNet-50 as the foundation of the CNN. It also mentions the tools and software used for deep learning-related operations, such as MATLAB and the GeForce RTX 2070 Super GPU. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
