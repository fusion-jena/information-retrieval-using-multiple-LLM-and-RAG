Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on plant species identification using deep learning models, ensemble techniques, and evaluation metrics.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to employ strategies to handle randomness, such as:

1. Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation to reduce overfitting and improve model robustness.
3. Performing multiple runs with different random seeds to estimate the variability of the results.
4. Using ensemble methods, like bagging or stacking, to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds.

Since these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, I cannot provide a more specific answer based on the given information.
