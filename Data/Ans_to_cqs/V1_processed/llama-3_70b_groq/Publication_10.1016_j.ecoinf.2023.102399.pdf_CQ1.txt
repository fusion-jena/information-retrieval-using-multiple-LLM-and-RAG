Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development of a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation using deep neural networks and discusses the importance of high-quality images in reducing the workload for humans. It also mentions the use of underwater stereo images in a related study, but it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
