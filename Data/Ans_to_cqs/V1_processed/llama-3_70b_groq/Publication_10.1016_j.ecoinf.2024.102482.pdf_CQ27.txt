I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the application of deep learning techniques in ecology, the structure of the model, and its performance in water quality monitoring, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
