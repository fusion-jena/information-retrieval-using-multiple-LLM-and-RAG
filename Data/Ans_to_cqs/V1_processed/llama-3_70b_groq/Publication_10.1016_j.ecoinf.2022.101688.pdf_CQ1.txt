Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the pre-processing of audio data, specifically vocalisations, and the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification tasks in bioacoustics research. It discusses the importance of selecting a suitable input size for CNNs, pre-processing hyper-parameters, and the performance of different CNN architectures.

There is no mention of data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
