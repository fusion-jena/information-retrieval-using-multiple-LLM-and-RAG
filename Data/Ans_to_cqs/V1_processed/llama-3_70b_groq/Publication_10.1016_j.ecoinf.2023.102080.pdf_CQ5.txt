I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a package called "covsel" for covariate selection in species distribution modeling (SDM), and it discusses various functions and arguments for filtering and embedding covariates. There is no mention of deep learning or image datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
