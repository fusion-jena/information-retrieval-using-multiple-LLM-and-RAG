The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some preprocessing steps in the context of land use and land cover classification using NAIP imagery.

One preprocessing step mentioned is the removal of structures (e.g., roads and buildings) and water from the scenes to reduce the average number of pixels per scene the classification model had to analyze. This step is not a typical preprocessing step for deep learning models, but rather a step specific to the land use and land cover classification task.

Another preprocessing step mentioned is the creation of a balanced dataset for training the machine learning model. The context mentions that the dataset was highly unbalanced due to the minority class of iceplant, and that multiple methods exist in the literature to improve balance in a dataset. However, in this case, the authors were able to create a reasonably balanced final training dataset without having to discard, repeat, or create synthetic data points.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
