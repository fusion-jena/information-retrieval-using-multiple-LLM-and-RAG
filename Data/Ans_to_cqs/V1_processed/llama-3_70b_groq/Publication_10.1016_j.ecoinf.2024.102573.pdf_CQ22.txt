According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Accuracy
2. Top-3 accuracy
3. F1-score
4. Precision
5. Recall

These metrics are shown in Table 2, which presents the test results of the frontends. The macro-averaged f1-score on the validation set is also used to monitor the model convergence.
