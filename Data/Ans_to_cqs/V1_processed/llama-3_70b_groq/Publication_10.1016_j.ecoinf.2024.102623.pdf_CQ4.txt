Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the MLP model, its training parameters, and the importance of deep learning techniques in species distribution modeling. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
