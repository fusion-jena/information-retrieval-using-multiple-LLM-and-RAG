The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text explains the automatic search algorithm used to detect pygmy blue whale song vocalisations, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. It mentions the frequency bands used in the algorithm and the comparison with surrounding sea noise, as well as the manual verification of detections using spectrograms. However, it does not discuss the optimization of hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
