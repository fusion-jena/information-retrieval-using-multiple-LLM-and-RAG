The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including precision, recall, and average-precision (AP). Precision is the fraction of predictions of presence that are correct, while recall, also known as sensitivity or true-positive rate, measures the fraction of presences that are correctly identified. The average-precision (AP) is defined as the weighted sum of precisions at each threshold, using the increase in recall from the previous threshold as the weight. It approximates the integral of, or area under, the precision-recall curve. Additionally, the mean-average-precision (mAP) across classes is used in multi-label prediction evaluation.
