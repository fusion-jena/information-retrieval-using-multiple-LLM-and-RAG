I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for wildfire science, remote sensing, and machine learning. The text mentions various datasets, algorithms, and techniques, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
