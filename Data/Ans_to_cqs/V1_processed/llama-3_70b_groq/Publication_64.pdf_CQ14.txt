Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the evaluation of the ResNet50 model, the datasets used, and the accuracy results, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
