I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the advantages of different neural network architectures, such as ResNet and ViT, and their applications in image classification and object localization. It also mentions the construction of a CA-Hybrid network for Cervidae classification and the use of YOLOv7 for object localization. However, it does not provide information about the data repository where the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
