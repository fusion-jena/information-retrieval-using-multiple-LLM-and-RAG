The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. The models mentioned are Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF). The hyperparameters mentioned are related to these models, not a deep learning model. 

The context shows the distribution of SVR hyperparameters after 1000 samplings, but it does not specify the exact hyperparameters. For the Random Forest model, the context mentions the hyperparameter "n_estimators", which is the number of regression trees in the forest. However, it does not mention other hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer, which are typically associated with deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query because the context does not provide information about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
