Based on the provided context, it appears that the discussion is focused on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) rather than deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I couldn't find any specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as random seed values.

However, I can infer that the context mentions the element of randomness in the classification algorithm, specifically in random initialization of weights in Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) or random sampling during training. To handle this randomness, the experiments are performed over different runs to capture the variability introduced by these random factors.

If I were to extrapolate this concept to deep learning pipelines, one possible strategy to handle randomness could be to perform multiple runs with different random seed values to capture the variability introduced by random initialization of weights or other random factors. This would help to ensure that the results are robust and not biased towards a particular random initialization.

However, I must emphasize that this is an inference and not a direct answer based on the provided context. If you're looking for specific strategies employed in deep learning pipelines, I would recommend exploring other resources or context that directly address this topic.
