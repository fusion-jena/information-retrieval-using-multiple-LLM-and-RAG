Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting are not explicitly mentioned in the context of deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that in the context of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), the parameter "c" is used to penalize the number of samples inside the margin, which helps to mitigate overfitting. 

In the context of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), it is mentioned that the regularization parameter "decay" is used to avoid overfitting. This suggests that L2 regularization (also known as weight decay) is used as a regularization method in the ANN model.

There is no mention of dropout as a regularization method in the provided context.
