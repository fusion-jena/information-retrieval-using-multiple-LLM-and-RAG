The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses the use of search algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for model parameter optimization, but it does not provide information on optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
