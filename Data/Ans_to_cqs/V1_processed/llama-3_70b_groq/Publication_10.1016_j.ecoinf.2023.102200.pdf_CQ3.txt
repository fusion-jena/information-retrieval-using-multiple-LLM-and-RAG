Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in various fields such as wetlands classification, mangrove crown diameter measurement, tree canopies segmentation, and individual tree segmentation. 

However, it can be inferred that some form of annotation is required for training deep learning models. For instance, in object detection tasks like individual tree segmentation, bounding box annotation might be used to label the objects of interest. Similarly, instance segmentation might be used to annotate individual objects within a class. 

But, without explicit mention of the annotation techniques used, it is difficult to provide a specific answer. Therefore, I don't know the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
