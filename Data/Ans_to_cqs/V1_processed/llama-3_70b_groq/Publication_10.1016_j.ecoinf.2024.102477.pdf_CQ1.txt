Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on air pollution analysis, specifically on carbon monoxide in Taiwan. However, the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for data collection. The context primarily consists of references to various research papers and articles related to air pollution, deep learning, and machine learning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
