I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any platform, nor does it mention any cloud computing services such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be discussing a research paper on ecological informatics, specifically a model for predicting real-world phenomena like wildfire spreads or pest plant propagation. It discusses the model's parameters, update criteria, and potential improvements, but does not mention deployment or any specific platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
