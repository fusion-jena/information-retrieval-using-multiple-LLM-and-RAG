The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset built for cactus recognition in aerial images, specifically for the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley in Mexico. This dataset is not a well-known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather a custom-built dataset for a specific task. The authors of the paper mention that they had to build their own dataset due to the lack of previous information.
