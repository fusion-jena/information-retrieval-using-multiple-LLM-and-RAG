I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context focuses on the methodology and research related to optimizing data structures for machine learning classification using Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery and XAI techniques. It does not provide information about the deployment platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
