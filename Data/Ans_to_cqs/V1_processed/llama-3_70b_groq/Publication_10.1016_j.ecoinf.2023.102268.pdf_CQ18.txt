The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, 50% of the training data were held-out for validation, which was used for model selection and parameter optimization. This approach allows for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data during training and helps in identifying the best-performing model.
