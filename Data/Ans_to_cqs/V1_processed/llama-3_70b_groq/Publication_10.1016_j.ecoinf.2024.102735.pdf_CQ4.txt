I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, being applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning models, specifically random forest, for predicting chlorophyll-a concentrations in water quality datasets. It also mentions the importance of considering uncertainty in model predictions and the use of various machine learning models for HABs monitoring and prediction. However, it does not provide any information about data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
