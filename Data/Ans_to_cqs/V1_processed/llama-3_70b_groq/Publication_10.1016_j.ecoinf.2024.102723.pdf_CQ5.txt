The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the implementation of Neural Networks using TensorFlow and Keras, and the application of Bayesian Deep Learning models to regression problems in agriculture. It does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
