Based on the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete are:

1. Acceptable RMS (Root Mean Square) value: The training process stops when the RMS value reaches a certain acceptable threshold, which is set to 0.01 in this case.
2. Number of Iterations: The training process is set to run for a maximum of 10,000 iterations.

There is no mention of validation loss plateau as a criteria for determining when training is complete. The provided context only mentions the RMS value and the number of iterations as the stopping criteria for the training process.
