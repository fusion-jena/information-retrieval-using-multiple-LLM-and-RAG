I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or any specific platform where the code is available. The context appears to be a research article discussing the use of a machine learning model (MLPnn-MC) for forest carbon sequestration mapping and economic quantification, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
