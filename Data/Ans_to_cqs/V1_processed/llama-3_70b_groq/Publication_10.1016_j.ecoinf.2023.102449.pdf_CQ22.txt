Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the model, as well as its application in ecoacoustic representations. It does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
