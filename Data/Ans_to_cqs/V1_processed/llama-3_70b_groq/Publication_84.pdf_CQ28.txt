Google Earth Engine (GEE)

The context mentions that "GEE provides an ideal platform for handling massive amount of data required by the pixel-based method (i.e. Ppf-CM) with its powerful data storage and high computational capacity." This suggests that the deep learning model was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.
