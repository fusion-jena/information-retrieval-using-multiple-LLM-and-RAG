I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that a machine learning algorithm was used to select important video factors, but it does not provide further details about the model architecture or type. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
