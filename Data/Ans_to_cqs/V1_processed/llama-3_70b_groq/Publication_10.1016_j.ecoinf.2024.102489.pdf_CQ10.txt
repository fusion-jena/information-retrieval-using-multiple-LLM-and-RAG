I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, discussing the use of satellite images and data sources for estimating leaf area index (LAI) in the Chishui River Basin. The figures and tables provided show the research area, satellite image information, and data sources, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
