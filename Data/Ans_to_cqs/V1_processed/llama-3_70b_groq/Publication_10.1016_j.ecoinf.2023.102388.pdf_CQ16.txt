Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the training process, attack model, and evaluation metrics, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for training.

In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, convergence of the model's performance on the validation set, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete based on the provided context.
