The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be focused on traditional machine learning algorithms and techniques, including random forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines, penalized regression, support vector machine, gradient boosting, artificial neural network, and k-Nearest Neighbors. 

The context also mentions the use of Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information about the specific framework or library used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
