Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that "different data augmentation techniques" can be used to increase the power of generalization, but it does not specify which techniques were used in this particular study. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
