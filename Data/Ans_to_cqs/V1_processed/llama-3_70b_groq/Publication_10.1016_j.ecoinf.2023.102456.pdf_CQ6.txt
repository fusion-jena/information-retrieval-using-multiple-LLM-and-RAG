Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on explaining a data-driven architecture for learning neighbourhood relationships and its application in forest fire simulation. It discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically backpropagation, and the importance of differentiable functions for computing gradients accurately. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
