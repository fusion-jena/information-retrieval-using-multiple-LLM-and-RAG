Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using a ground-based profiling canopy LiDAR (PCL) multi-temporal dataset. This dataset is sourced from a small yet representative region in the central Amazon, with LiDAR surveys conducted at high, medium, and low points along the topographic gradient. The LiDAR point clouds are then transformed into images, which are used to train and test the deep learning models. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in this specific context.
