The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameters used for the Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Boosting Machine (GBM) models, such as the number of trees, minimum size of terminal nodes, shrinkage, and interaction parameters. However, it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were optimized, whether through grid search, random search, or other methods.
