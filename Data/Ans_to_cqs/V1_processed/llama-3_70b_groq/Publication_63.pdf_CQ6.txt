The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It only mentions that a random sample of 10% of the dataset of each trait was extracted before model training, and the remaining data was split into a 'training dataset' and a 'validation dataset' by a ratio of 4:1. It does not provide information on normalization, scaling, cleaning, or any other preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study.
