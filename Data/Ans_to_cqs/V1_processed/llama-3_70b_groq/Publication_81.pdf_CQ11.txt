I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning methods for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. It provides references to other research papers and methods, but does not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
