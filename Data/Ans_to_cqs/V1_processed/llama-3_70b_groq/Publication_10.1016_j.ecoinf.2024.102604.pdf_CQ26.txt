The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to bias correction in species distribution modeling (SDM) and discusses various methods for correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces.

However, it does mention some bias correction methods, such as:

* Aggregation background method
* Geographic filtering
* Similarity background method
* Restricted background method
* Thickening background method
* Weaken bias covariates

These methods are specific to SDM and may not be directly applicable to addressing data bias in a deep learning pipeline.

If you're looking for techniques to address data bias in a deep learning pipeline, some common methods include:

* Stratified splitting
* Oversampling
* Undersampling
* Diverse data collection
* Data augmentation
* Weighted sampling
* Bias regularization

These techniques can help mitigate data bias and improve the performance of deep learning models. However, the specific technique used would depend on the nature of the data and the problem being addressed.
