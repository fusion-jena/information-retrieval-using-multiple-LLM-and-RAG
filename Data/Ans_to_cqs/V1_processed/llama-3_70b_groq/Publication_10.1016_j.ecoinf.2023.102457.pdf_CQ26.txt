Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in bioacoustics, specifically for individual acoustic discrimination and monitoring of animal populations. It discusses the use of pre-trained models, such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, for feature extraction and classification, but does not delve into data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
