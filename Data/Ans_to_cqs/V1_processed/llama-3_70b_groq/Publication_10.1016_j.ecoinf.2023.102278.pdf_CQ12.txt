The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3, which are both CNN architectures. Additionally, the text mentions the use of transfer learning from ImageNet, which is a common practice in CNN-based image classification tasks. The architecture is also described as a multitask CNN for hierarchical classification, further supporting the conclusion that a CNN is used in the pipeline.
