The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "data augmentation" as a method used to ensure the reliability of the results. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, which can help reduce overfitting and improve model robustness.

The context also mentions pseudo-labeling, which is a technique used in semi-supervised learning to assign labels to unlabeled data. This can help address class imbalance issues, but it is not a direct technique for addressing data bias.

The other techniques mentioned in the query, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the context whether these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
