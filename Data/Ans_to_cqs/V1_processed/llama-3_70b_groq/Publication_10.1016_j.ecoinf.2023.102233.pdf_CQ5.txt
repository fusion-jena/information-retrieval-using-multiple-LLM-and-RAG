The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors used custom datasets consisting of audio recordings from bioacoustic recorders. The training/validation dataset comprised 6363 hours of audio from ten independent sites, and the test dataset comprised 2735 hours of audio from nine independent sites. These datasets were used to train a CNN model for automated wildlife call recognition, specifically for recognizing the calls of the Superb Lyrebird (SBTF).
