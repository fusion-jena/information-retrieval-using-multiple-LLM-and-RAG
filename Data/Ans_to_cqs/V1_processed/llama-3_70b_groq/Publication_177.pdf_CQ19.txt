The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the use of pre-trained ImageNet weights, fine-tuning, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. It does not provide information about the framework used, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
