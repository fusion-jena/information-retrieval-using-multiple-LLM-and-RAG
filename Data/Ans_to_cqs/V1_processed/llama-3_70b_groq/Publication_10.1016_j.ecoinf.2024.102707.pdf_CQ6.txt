Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology and references related to object detection using YOLOv6 and other deep learning models for aerial animal detection. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
