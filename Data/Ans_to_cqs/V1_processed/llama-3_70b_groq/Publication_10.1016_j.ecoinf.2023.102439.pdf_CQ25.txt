The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to predict vegetation biomass density for 2030. The model is a hybrid of wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm, which is a type of artificial neural network. The input layer of the model consists of three processing elements corresponding to the LST, temperature, and precipitation parameters, and the output layer is the EVI data. The model is trained to learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships among the data, and utilize them to make predictions for future scenarios. 

In this case, the purpose of the model can be classified as a regression task, as it is predicting a continuous value (vegetation biomass density) rather than performing classification, segmentation, or detection.
