The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text describes a deep learning framework for species assemblage prediction, but it does not specify the architecture of the neural network. It only mentions that the model is trained with a cross-entropy loss function and uses a softmax output layer, which is a common setup for many deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact type of model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) based on the provided information.
