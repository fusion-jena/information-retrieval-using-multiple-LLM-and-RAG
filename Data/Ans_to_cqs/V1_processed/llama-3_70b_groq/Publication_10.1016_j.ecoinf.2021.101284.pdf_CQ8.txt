I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It discusses ecological informatics, COVID-19 cases, and a Maximum Entropy based Ecological Niche Model (ME-ENM) used to identify geographical areas with a high infection rate. There is no information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline.
