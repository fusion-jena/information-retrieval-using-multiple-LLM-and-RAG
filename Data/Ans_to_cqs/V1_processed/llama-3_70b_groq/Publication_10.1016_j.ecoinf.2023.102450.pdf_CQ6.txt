Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for animal tracking and behavior analysis in wildlife videos. It discusses the use of various models such as YOLOv4, Siamese networks, and few-shot learning methods, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
