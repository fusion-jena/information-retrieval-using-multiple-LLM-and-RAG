The context provides some information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Specifically, it mentions that the model is trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer as the learning rule. However, it does not provide information about the learning rate used. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the optimizer used is Adam, but the learning rate is not specified.
