Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on land use/land cover classification and forest type classification using the XGBoost method, and it provides various tables and results related to the study. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
