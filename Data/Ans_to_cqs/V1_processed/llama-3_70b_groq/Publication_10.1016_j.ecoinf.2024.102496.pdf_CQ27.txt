I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a trained deep learning model or its deployment process. The context appears to be related to the development of an equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool, which involves incorporating pollutant loads and environmental justice metrics into a GIS web app builder. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
