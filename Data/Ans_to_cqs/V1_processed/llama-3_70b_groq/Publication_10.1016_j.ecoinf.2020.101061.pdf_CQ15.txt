The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the use of a Tesla K80 GPU for 5 epochs and retraining the network for 40 epochs, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
