The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) for hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation, but it does not specify the performance metrics used. 

The context provides information about the tuning parameters, their ranges, and optimal values for each algorithm, but it does not mention metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, or other evaluation metrics commonly used in machine learning. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
