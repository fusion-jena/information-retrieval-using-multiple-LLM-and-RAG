Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning models for object detection and tagging efficiency in data labeling. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks, ensemble learning, and object detection models, but it does not provide information on techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
