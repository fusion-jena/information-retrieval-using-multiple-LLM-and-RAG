Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are R2, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). These metrics are mentioned in Table 2, which presents the prediction performance of reforestation carbon stock using XGBoost and ANN models. R2 is a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the data, while RMSE and MAE are measures of the average difference between predicted and actual values.
