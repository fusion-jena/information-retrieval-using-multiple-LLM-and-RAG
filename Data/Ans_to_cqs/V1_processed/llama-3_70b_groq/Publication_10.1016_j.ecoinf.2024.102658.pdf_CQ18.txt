The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (2020) is followed, which involves an iterative modeling process. This process involves systematically repeating the cycle of inspecting the outputs of a model, analyzing the effects of the model and its configurations, and adjusting the configurations or switching to another model type according to the observations. This implies that the model performance is monitored and evaluated during training, and adjustments are made based on the observations. However, the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance are not mentioned.
