Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context appears to discuss the importance of including all observations in statistical modeling, the use of Bayesian algorithms, and the development of a bat calls detection and classification method based on convolutional neural networks. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
