The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. Specifically, the images are multi-band images with 8, 36, or 72 bands, and each band is a single-band image. The images are converted into 256x256-pixel image units, and each image unit is further divided into single-band images using Python's Rasterio module to reduce memory capacity issues.
