The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of ResNet and GoogLeNet, which are both types of CNNs. ResNet is described as the "most accurate and deepest CNN available" and GoogLeNet is based on inception v3, which is a type of CNN architecture. Additionally, the context discusses the use of image patches and convolutional layers, which are typical components of CNNs.
