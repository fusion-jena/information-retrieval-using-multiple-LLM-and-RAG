The provided context does not mention deep learning or any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing logistic regression and random forest models, with a focus on feature selection and model evaluation using cross-validation. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques specific to deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
