I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset is stored or shared. The text only introduces the dataset, describes its characteristics, and presents the results of experiments using different deep learning architectures. It does not provide information about the dataset's availability or repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
