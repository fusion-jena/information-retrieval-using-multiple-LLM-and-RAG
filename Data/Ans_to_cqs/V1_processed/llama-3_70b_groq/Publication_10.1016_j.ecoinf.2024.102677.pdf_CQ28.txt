I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the evaluation of five network models, including Inceptionv3 and ResNet, and their performance in landscape type classification. It also provides information about the datasets used, including their sources and meanings. However, there is no mention of the platform used to deploy the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
