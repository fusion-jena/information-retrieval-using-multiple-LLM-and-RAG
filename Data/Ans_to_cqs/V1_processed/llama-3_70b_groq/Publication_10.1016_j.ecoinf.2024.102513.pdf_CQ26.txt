The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and functionality of neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks, and their application in land use and land cover (LULC) analysis. It discusses the convolutional layer, pooling layer, attention mechanisms, and transfer learning, but does not touch upon data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the given context.
