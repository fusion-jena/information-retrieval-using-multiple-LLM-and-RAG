Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the model training parameters, architecture, and computational resources used. It discusses the input data resolution, batch normalization, batch size, activation functions, learning rate, and dropout rate, but it does not provide information on how the dataset was split or if any techniques were used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
