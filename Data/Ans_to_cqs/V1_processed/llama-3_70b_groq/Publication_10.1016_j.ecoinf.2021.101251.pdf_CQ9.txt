I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. The context discusses dynamic data citations, data repositories, and data packages, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its data repository. The mentioned repositories, such as GBIF, ESS-DIVE, and others, are not related to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
