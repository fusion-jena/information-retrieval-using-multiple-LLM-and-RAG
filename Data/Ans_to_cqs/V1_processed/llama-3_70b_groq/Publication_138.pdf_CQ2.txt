Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image recognition and classification tasks. The context mentions various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG, and ResNet, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. 

There is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV in the context. However, it can be inferred that the input data format is likely images, given the discussion of convolutional layers, filters, and pooling operators. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely images.
