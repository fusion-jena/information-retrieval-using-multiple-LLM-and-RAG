The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of models correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models are ΔAUC (change in Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) and ΔD. These metrics are used to compare the performance of corrected models with uncorrected models. The context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics.
