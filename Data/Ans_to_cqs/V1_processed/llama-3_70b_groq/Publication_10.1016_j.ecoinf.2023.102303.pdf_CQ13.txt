I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context discusses the application of deep learning methodologies to underwater fish video processing techniques, the EfficientNet-B7 model, and the development of two novel deep learning models for semi-supervised contrastive learning and weakly-supervised learning. However, it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in these models.
