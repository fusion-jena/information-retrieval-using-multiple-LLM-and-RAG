The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors used a form of image classification annotation, where each thumbnail is labeled with a specific class (e.g., species of fish, part of fish, fish, random/speciÔ¨Åc background). 

The authors also mention that they cropped frames from videos and created a training database composed of 13,000 fish thumbnails, where each thumbnail contains only one labeled-fish. This suggests that the authors might have used a form of object detection annotation, where the location of the fish in the thumbnail is annotated, but this is not explicitly stated.

There is no mention of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are common techniques used in object detection tasks. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques were used in this specific pipeline.
