The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. It only mentions that a two-stage process is used to train the CNN model, with smaller learning rates used in the second stage for fine-tuning. Additionally, it mentions the use of data augmentation and dropout techniques to enhance model robustness. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm used to update the model parameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
