I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to unmanned aircraft systems, wildlife research, and biodiversity monitoring, but it does not provide information on deep learning model training or data splitting criteria. The references cited are mostly related to ecology, environment, and conservation biology, with no mention of machine learning or deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
