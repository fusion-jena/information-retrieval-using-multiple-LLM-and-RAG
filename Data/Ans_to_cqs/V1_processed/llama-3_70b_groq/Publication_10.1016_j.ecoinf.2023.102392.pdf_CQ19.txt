I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of XGBoost, which is an extreme gradient boosting model, but it does not specify the framework used to implement the deep learning model. The context discusses the application of deep learning models in various studies, but it does not provide information about the framework used to build these models. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is used to build the deep learning model.
