The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text focuses on the challenges of using machine learning approaches for ecology and conservation applications, particularly in dealing with imperfect training data. It discusses the issue of mixed pixels, where the target invader species may not form dense or large stands on the landscape, and how this can lead to variability or errors in the training dataset. The paper presents a multiple-instance learning algorithm as a solution to handle this variability, but it does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
