The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline varies across different studies mentioned in the context. 

In the study by Azadnia et al. (2022), a deep CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based on global average pooling is used for medicinal plant identification.

In the study by Barhate et al. (2023), a hybrid deep learning model using VGG-16 and dimensionality reduction with ESPCA is used for plant species classification.

In the study by Ganguly et al. (2022), a ResNet-50 architecture is used to capture leaf feature patterns via fusion learning.

There is no mention of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or Transformer models in the provided context.
