The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the model's architecture, evaluation metrics, and training process. It discusses the selection of suitable optimizers, loss functions, and activation functions, as well as the model's performance on the validation dataset. However, it does not provide information on the dataset's characteristics, data preprocessing, or techniques used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based on the provided context.
