The measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically Waveman, include the addition of a new kind of Batch Normalization (BNorm) layers behind the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting. This allows the model to "learn" to generalize from a trend in both "known" and "unknown" datasets rather than maximizing performance on the "known" datasets (training datasets). 

Another measure taken is the use of a large batch size of 128, which means training with 128 images for each iteration. This helps to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the model was tested on a validation dataset (filtered data) to evaluate its performance and identify any taxon bias. The model was also tested on unfiltered audio files recorded under different human and natural conditions to evaluate its generalization ability.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. However, the use of a validation dataset and testing on different datasets (e.g., corridor audio files) suggests that some form of validation and testing were performed to ensure the model's generalizability.
