The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of random forest and other machine learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, the context does mention the use of cross-validation (CV) to select feature sets. Specifically, it mentions the use of random CV and spatial CV to select different feature sets, which are then compared in the final modeling and analysis. This suggests that cross-validation was used to ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models used in the study.
