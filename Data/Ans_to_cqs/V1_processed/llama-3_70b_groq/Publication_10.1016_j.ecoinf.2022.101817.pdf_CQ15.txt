I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the CNN architecture, model evaluation, and power consumption measurements, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
