I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a research article or paper discussing a model for environmental flow and riparian ecosystem management. The text includes mathematical equations, figures, and explanations of the model's components and parameters. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context suggests that the model is a mathematical or computational model, but it does not provide any information about the implementation or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
