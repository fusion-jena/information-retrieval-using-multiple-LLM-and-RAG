The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are:

1. Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): It is the ratio of accurate prediction of the bleached corals.
2. Specificity: It is the ratio of accurate prediction of the unbleached corals.
3. Accuracy: It is the ratio of correct prediction to the total number of instances.
4. F1-score: It is the weighted mean of sensitivity and specificity.
5. Cohen's Kappa (Îº): It measures the amount of data by the execution of the classifier for the examination of its performance in case of some coincidence.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, including hand-crafted descriptors and D-CNN models, on different datasets. The values of these metrics are provided in Tables 2 and 4 for the first and third datasets, respectively.
