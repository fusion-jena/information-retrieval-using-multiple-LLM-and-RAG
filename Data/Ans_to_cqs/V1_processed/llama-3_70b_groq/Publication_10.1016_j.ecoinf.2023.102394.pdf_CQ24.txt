Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in soil carbon mapping, ecological informatics, and agriculture-related elements, as well as referencing various studies and tools related to these topics. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
