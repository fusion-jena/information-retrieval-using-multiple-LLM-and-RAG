Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The context mentions "large-scale image datasets" and provides parameters for image preprocessing, such as resizing to (224, 224), normalizing, and adding noise (Gaussian Noise, Speckle Noise). There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
