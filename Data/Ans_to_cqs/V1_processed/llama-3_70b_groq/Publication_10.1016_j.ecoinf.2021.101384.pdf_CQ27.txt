I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the workflow of an Open Science approach that combines vessel tracking data with environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data, but it does not provide information on model deployment. The context mentions machine learning models being used for classifying fishing activity cells, but it does not elaborate on the deployment process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
