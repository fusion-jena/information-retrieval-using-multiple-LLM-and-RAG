I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text discusses a Monte Carlo method-based classification model for predicting real-world phenomena such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation. It highlights the limitations of the model, including computational challenges and the need for a sufficient number of trials to ensure reliable results. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
