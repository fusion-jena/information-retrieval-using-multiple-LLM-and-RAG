I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and vegetation indices, discussing various methods for estimating rice leaf chlorophyll content and crop coverage. It mentions several machine learning models, including random forest, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron, extreme gradient boosting, and multiple linear regression, but does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in these models.
