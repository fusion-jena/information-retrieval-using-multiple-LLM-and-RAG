I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context appears to be discussing ecological informatics, forest biomass density, and downscaling models, which is unrelated to the query. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
