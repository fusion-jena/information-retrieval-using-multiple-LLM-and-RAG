The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that "all images were resized to 1333 Ã— 800 pixels to match with the pre-training data (COCO dataset)". This suggests that image resizing was one of the preprocessing steps performed. 

No other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given information whether these steps were performed or not.
