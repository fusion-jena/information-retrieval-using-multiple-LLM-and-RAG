Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. However, it does mention that in one of the studies (Barhate et al., 2023), hyperparameter tuning was done using batch updated stochastic gradient descent technique. This suggests that stochastic gradient descent was used as the optimizer, but the learning rate is not specified. For other deep learning models mentioned in the context, such as ResNet-50, the hyperparameters are not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a complete answer to this query.
