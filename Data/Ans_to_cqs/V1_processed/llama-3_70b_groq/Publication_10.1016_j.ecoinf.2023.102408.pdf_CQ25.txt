The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the provided information, it appears that the model is used for nonlinear regression, specifically for predicting Above-Ground Biomass (AGB). The model is evaluated based on its accuracy, and the predicted values are compared to observed AGB values, as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this case is regression, specifically predicting a continuous value (AGB).
