The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be discussing a Random Forest (RF) model, not a deep learning model. It mentions 10-fold cross-validation, which is a resampling technique used to evaluate the performance of a model, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem and model being used. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and time-series splitting. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used in this case.

It's worth noting that the context does mention the use of R statistical software for building the RF model, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training and testing.
