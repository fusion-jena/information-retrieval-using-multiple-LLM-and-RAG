The context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions "R" which refers to the R programming language and environment for statistical computing, but it is not related to building the deep learning model. It also mentions "DCNN" which refers to deep convolutional neural network, but it does not specify the framework used to build it. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
