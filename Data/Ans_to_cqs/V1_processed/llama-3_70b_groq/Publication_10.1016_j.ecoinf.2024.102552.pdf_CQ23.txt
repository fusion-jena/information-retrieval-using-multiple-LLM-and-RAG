The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The text discusses a manual classification method and mentions the potential use of machine learning tools to refine classifications, but it does not provide details on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such models.

The context does mention the use of NAIP imagery and massive training datasets, but it does not specify whether these were used for training a deep learning model or for other purposes. It also cautions that machine learning methods are limited by the quality of their inputs, but it does not provide information on how to address this limitation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
