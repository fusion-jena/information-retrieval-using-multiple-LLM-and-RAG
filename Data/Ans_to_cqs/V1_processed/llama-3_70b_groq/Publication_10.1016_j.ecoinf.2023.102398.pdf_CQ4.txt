Based on the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

* Flipud (flip up-down)
* Fliplr (flip left-right)
* Translate
* Scale
* Shear
* Perspective
* Mosaic
* Mixup
* Copy_paste

Additionally, the context also mentions HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) augmentation with specific values for hsv_h, hsv_s, and hsv_v. There is also a mention of "degrees" which might be related to rotation, but the exact meaning is not clear from the context.

It's worth noting that the context does not explicitly mention flipping, rotating, or scaling as separate augmentation techniques, but they are implied through the presence of flipud, fliplr, translate, scale, and degrees.
