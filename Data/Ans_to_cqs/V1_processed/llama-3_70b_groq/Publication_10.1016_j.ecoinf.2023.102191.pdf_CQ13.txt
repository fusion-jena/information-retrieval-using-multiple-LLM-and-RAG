I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to be discussing a monitoring program for the dive community, which involves collecting data on marine taxa and assessing the usability of an app. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning models, and therefore, it is not possible to determine the hyperparameters used in such a model.
