Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 

RMSE is defined as the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squared differences between the predicted and true values for each group, divided by the number of groups. A smaller RMSE value indicates higher algorithmic accuracy, signifying that the predicted values are closer to the true values.

MAE is used to represent the average of the absolute error between the true value and the predicted value, the smaller the MAE value, the closer the predicted value is to the true value.

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context.
