The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of validation sets and the reporting of validation losses and metrics such as PSNR and SSIM. This suggests that the training process may be monitored using these validation metrics, and training may be stopped when a plateau is reached or when the validation metrics stop improving. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the classification networks were trained for 20 epochs, which implies that the number of epochs may be used as a stopping criterion. However, it is not clear if the number of epochs was chosen based on a specific criterion, such as a plateau in the validation loss, or if it was arbitrarily chosen.

In summary, while the context does not provide a clear answer to the query, it suggests that validation metrics and the number of epochs may be used to determine when training is complete. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated.
