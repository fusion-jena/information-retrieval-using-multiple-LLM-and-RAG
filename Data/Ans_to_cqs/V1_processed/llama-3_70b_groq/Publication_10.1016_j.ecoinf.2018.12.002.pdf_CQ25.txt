The purpose of the machine learning models mentioned in the context, such as random forests and support vector machines, is behavioral classification. These models are used to classify animal behavior based on Accelerometer (ACC) data. The context does not specifically mention deep learning models, but it discusses the application of machine learning algorithms in supervised learning for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data.
