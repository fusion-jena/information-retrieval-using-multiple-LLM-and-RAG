I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects of the pipeline, such as model segmentation, real distance extraction, metric extraction, and inference using Deeplabv3+, but it does not provide a link to a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link as an answer to this query.
