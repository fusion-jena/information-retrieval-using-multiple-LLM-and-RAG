Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only discusses the fine-tuning process, patch size, and number of epochs, but does not provide information about the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
