Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different neural network architectures (DenseNet, Matching Networks, Prototypical Networks, and Relation Networks) for unsupervised acoustic feature extraction and clustering of unknown or rare bird sounds. It discusses the importance of fine-tuning the CNN backbone of the model for improving clustering quality and presents results on the Darksound dataset.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
