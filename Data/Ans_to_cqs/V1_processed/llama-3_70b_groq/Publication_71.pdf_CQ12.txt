The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of DeepLabV3+, a variant of CNN models, and also describes the architecture of the CNN model used, including the number of convolutional layers, filter sizes, and stride. Additionally, the context discusses the need to adjust the DeepLabV3+ architecture to accommodate four-channel input images, which further supports the conclusion that a CNN model is being used.
