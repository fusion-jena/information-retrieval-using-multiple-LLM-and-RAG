The purpose of the deep learning model (artificial neural network, ANN) in this context is regression, specifically to predict the SPAD value. The ANN is used to model the SPAD value based on the Rasp2SPAD indices, and it takes two input nodes (parameters) and outputs a predicted SPAD value. The goal is to establish a relationship between the input parameters and the SPAD value, allowing for the prediction of the latter based on the former.
