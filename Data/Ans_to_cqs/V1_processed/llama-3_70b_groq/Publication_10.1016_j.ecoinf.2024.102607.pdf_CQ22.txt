The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the evaluation of land use and land cover (LULC) mapping models using various metrics. 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the LULC mapping models include:

1. Producer Accuracy (PA)
2. User Accuracy (UA)
3. Overall Accuracy (OA)
4. Kappa coefficient (Kappa%)

These metrics are commonly used in remote sensing and land cover classification tasks to evaluate the performance of classification models. However, it is essential to note that the context does not specifically mention the use of deep learning models. If the query is asking about the evaluation metrics for deep learning models in general, the answer would be different. Common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, and others, depending on the specific problem and task.
