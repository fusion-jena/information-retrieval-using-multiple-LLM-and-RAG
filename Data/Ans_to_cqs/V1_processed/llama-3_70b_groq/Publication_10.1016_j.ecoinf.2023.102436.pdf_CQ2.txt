Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically landscape photographs. This is evident from the mention of convolutional neural networks being applied to recognize woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. Additionally, the context mentions image-based methods being used to assess and track landscape visual quality. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
