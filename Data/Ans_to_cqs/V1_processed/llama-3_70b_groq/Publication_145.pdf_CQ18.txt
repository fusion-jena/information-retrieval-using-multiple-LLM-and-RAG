Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the model architecture, loss function, optimizer, and training parameters, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
