The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of heavy augmentation techniques, including multiply, linear contrast, sharpen, emboss, flip in horizontal and vertical directions, rotations, and affine transformation. These techniques can help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model, which can indirectly address data bias issues. However, it does not provide information on specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in this context.
