Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The text focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks for tree identification in airborne imagery, discussing the use of pretraining data, hand-annotated data, and sensitivity studies to evaluate model performance. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
