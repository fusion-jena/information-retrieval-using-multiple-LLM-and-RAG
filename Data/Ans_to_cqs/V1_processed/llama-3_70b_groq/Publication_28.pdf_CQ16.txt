Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the experimental results analysis of the PTDLEN-VAE model and its comparison with other techniques. It discusses the performance metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score, but does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
