Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the limitations of the original YOLOv8 network and the proposed modifications to improve feature extraction and reduce computational complexity. It discusses the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
