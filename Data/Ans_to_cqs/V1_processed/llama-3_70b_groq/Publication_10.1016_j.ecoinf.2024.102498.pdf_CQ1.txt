Based on the provided context, it appears that satellite imagery is used as a source of raw data for the deep learning pipeline. This is inferred from the mention of "satellite imagery" in the passage, which is used to extract sophisticated features for LULC classification. Additionally, the reference to "Remote Sens." in the citation list suggests that remote sensing data may be used as a source of raw data.

However, the context does not provide explicit information on other methods of collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets. It is possible that these methods may be used in conjunction with satellite imagery, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that satellite imagery is one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, but the context does not provide information on other methods.
