The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation. This method maximizes the use of available data, reduces bias in performance estimation, and is particularly useful for small datasets. It rigorously assesses model performance by iterative training on all but one sample and evaluating the excluded sample.
