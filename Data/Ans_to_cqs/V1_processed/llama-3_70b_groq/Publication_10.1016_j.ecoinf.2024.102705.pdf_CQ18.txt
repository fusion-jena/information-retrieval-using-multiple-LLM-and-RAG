The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the evaluation of models commonly utilizes Average Precision (AP) as a mainstream performance metric, which represents the area under the precision-recall curve. This suggests that AP might be used to monitor the model performance during training, but it is not explicitly stated.
