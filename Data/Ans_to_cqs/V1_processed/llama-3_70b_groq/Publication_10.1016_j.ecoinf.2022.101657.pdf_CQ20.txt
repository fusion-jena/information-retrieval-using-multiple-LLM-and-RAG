The provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the implementation of neural networks on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for reducing power consumption, but it does not provide information about the training process or the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
