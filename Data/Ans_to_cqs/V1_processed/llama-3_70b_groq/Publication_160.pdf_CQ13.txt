Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different ResNet architectures on validation and test sets, and discusses topics like patch size, batch size, and calibration of the network. It does mention that hyperparameters like depth, batch normalization, and weight decay can influence calibration, but it does not provide specific values or details about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
