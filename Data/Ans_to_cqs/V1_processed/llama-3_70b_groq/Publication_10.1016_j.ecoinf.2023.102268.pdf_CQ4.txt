The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the application of ResNet-50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), to extract features from spectrogram images, and the use of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques being applied to the data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
