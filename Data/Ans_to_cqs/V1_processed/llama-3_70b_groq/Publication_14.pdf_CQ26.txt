The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development of DeepMeerkat, a deep convolutional neural network for background subtraction, and its application in camera trap studies.

However, it can be inferred that the authors might have considered data bias during the development of DeepMeerkat, as they mention that the model is designed to be conservative with a high threshold for retaining frames (acceptance value = 0.1). This suggests that the authors might have taken steps to minimize false negatives, which could be related to addressing data bias.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
