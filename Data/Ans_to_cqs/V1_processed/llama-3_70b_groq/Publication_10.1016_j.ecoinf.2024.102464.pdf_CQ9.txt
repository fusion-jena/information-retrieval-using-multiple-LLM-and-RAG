I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses a study on the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models and environmental variables from natural environment surveys. It mentions various references to other studies and publications, but does not provide information about a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
