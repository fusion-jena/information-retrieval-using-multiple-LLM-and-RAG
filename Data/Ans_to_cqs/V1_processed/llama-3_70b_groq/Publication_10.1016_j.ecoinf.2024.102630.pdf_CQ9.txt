I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be discussing a study that uses remote sensing data from various sources, including the Google Earth Engine platform, and provides information about the data and processing methods used in the study. However, it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
