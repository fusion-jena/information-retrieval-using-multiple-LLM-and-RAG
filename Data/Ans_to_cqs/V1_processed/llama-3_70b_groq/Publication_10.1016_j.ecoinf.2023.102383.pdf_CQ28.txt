I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the architecture of the model, including the use of FPN and ResNet152, and the process of assigning feature maps to regions of interest. It also provides information about the authors and their affiliations, but it does not provide any information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
