The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using seven metrics, which are: Mean Absolute Error (M), F-measure (Fβ), and Weighted F-measure (Fωβ). 

Mean Absolute Error (M) measures the pixel-level similarity between the final saliency map Spre and the ground-truth mask G. F-measure (Fβ) estimates the harmonic mean of precision and recall, with β2 set to 0.3 to assign greater weight to precision. Weighted F-measure (Fωβ) introduces a weight ω to handle the unreasonable comparison caused by flaws of prediction, representing error at different locations.

Note that accuracy is not explicitly mentioned as one of the evaluation metrics in the provided context. However, precision and recall are components of the F-measure and Weighted F-measure, which are used to evaluate the model's performance.
