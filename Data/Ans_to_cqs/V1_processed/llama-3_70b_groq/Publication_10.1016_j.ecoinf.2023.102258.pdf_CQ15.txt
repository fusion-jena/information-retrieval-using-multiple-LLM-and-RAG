Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context focuses on the methodology, architecture, and techniques used in few-shot learning, template matching, and transductive learning, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
