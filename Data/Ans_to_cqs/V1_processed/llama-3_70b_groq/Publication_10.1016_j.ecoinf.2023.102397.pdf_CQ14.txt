The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention the use of a random forest model in the data analysis step. According to Breiman (2001), random forests are an ensemble learning method that can be used for hyperparameter tuning. 

Although the context does not provide a clear answer to the query, it can be inferred that the hyperparameters might be optimized using a random forest approach. However, it is not clear whether a grid search or random search is used for hyperparameter optimization. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization.
