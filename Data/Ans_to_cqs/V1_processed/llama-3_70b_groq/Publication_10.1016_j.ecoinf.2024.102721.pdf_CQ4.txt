I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning methods, specifically LSTM models, for forecasting ecological water demand, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
