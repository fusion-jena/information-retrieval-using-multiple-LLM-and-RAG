The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors use various evaluation metrics to assess the performance and effectiveness of their model. These metrics include accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) percentage, balanced accuracy (B. Acc), F-measure FÎ², Cohen's kappa coefficient k, and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). The authors also mention that they will present the evaluation results through the use of figures and numerical data, and that graphical visualizations will effectively portray the performance estimation achievement.
