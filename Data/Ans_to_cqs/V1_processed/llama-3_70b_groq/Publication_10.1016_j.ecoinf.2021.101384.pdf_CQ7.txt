Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the multi-resolution decision approach, statistical analysis, and FAIR data principles in the context of vessel data and big data processing. It does not provide information on deep learning model training or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
