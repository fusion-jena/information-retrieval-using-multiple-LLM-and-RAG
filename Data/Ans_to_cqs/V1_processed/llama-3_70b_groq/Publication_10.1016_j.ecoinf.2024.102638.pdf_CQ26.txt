Based on the provided context, it appears that random sampling is used to divide the dataset into training and test sets, which helps to minimize the risk of bias. This is mentioned in the sentence: "This division is done by random sampling to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimise the risk of bias." 

However, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being used to address data bias during preprocessing. The context primarily focuses on the division of the dataset, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, but does not provide detailed information on data preprocessing techniques used to address bias.
