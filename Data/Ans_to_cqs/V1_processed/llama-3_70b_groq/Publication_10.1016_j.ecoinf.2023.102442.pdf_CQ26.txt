Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning techniques for detecting artisanal small-scale mining, Amazonian rainforest phenology, and other environmental-related topics. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of CART (Classification and Regression Trees) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which might be related to data preprocessing or feature engineering. But it does not provide any information on addressing data bias specifically.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
