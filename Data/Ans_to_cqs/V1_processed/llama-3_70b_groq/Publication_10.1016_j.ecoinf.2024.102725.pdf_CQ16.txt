I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are common criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning models. The context appears to be discussing a study that uses satellite data and various evaluation metrics (R2, RMSE, MAE, ERGAS) to assess the accuracy of predicted images, but it does not provide information about the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
