According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques mentioned are:

* Rotation
* Flipping
* Translation
* Cropping
* Changing the brightness of the pixels

These techniques are applied to artificially increase the number of samples in the training set, making the learning of CNN models robust to changes in scales, brightness, and geometrical distortions.
