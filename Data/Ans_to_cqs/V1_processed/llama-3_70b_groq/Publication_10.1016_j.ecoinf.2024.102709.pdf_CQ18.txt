The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of k-fold cross-validation, YOLO training losses, and mAP50 values. Specifically, the model was trained on each of the k different training splits, and the performance was evaluated using the YOLO loss function, which is divided into three parts: box loss, objectness loss, and classification loss. The box loss measures the error in the predicted bounding box coordinates and dimensions relative to the ground truth. The model with the highest mAP50 value, which indicates the highest number of correctly predicted labels, was considered to have the best performance. This approach allowed for the investigation of the best data split and the monitoring of the model's performance during training.
