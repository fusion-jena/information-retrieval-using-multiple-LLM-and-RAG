I don't know.

The provided context consists of academic papers and articles discussing various deep learning techniques and their applications in wildlife monitoring and animal recognition. However, none of these papers provide information about the code repository of a specific deep learning pipeline. The papers focus on presenting research results, methodologies, and discussions, but they do not include links or references to code repositories.

Without additional information or context, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of a specific deep learning pipeline is available. The papers may have used custom implementations or modified existing open-source libraries, but this information is not provided.

If you are looking for open-source deep learning libraries or repositories related to wildlife monitoring or animal recognition, you may need to search online or explore relevant GitHub repositories, but this would require additional research beyond the provided context.
