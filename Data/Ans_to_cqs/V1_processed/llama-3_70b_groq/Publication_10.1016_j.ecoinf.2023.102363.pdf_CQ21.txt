Based on the provided context, it appears that one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training is the generation of GradCAM plots. GradCAM is a technique used to visualize the regions of importance within the input data (in this case, spectrograms) that contribute to the model's classification predictions. The GradCAM plots are used to illustrate the model's classifications, as shown in Figure 7.

However, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as metrics calculation or confusion matrix generation. It is possible that these steps were performed but not reported in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether these steps were involved or not.

It is worth noting that the context focuses more on the model fine-tuning process and the experimental design, rather than the postprocessing steps. If more information was provided, it might be possible to determine the exact postprocessing steps involved.
