The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of 5 × 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models. This suggests that the data was split into 10 folds, and each fold was used as a test set once, while the remaining 9 folds were used as the training set. This process was repeated 5 times, resulting in 5 × 10 = 50 iterations.

It is not clear from the context whether a separate validation set was used, or if the cross-validation process was used to tune the hyperparameters of the models. Additionally, there is no mention of deep learning models specifically, as the context only mentions traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest.

In summary, while the context provides some information about the evaluation process, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for model training.
