Based on the provided context, it appears that the pipeline uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. Specifically, the synthetic connectivity data was generated using a GAN model, and the initial coral cover model was developed using a TVAE model, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder model. There is no mention of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models in the provided context.
