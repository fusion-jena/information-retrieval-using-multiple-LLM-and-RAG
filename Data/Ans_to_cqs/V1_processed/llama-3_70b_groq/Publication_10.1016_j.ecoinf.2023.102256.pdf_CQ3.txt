I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN model, the integration of contextual information, and the application of deep learning in ecology and other fields. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
