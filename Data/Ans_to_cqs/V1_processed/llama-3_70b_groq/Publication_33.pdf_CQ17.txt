Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the post-processing of the Deep Learning model's output to improve its accuracy and robustness. It discusses the calibration of Deep Learning models using a single parameter for all classes, but it does not delve into the regularization methods used during the training process.

However, it is worth noting that the context does cite a paper on deep residual learning for image recognition (He et al., 2016), which is a technique that can help alleviate overfitting issues. Additionally, it cites a paper on stopped training and other remedies for overfitting (Sarle, 1996), but it does not provide specific details on the regularization methods used.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
