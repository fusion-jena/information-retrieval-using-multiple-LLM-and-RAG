Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. This is evident from the mention of image dimensions (640 × 640 and 1280 × 1280) in the context of Faster R-CNN, a computer vision approach. Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning in computer vision for ecology, specifically for image classification tasks such as species identification. There is no mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV in the provided context.
