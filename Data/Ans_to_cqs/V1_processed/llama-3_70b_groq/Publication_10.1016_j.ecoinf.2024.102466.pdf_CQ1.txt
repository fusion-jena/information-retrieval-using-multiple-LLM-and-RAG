Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the study mentioned in the conclusion section used camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park to acquire 9717 images of 15 wild bird species. This suggests that camera traps are a method for collecting raw data, which is then used for bird object detection using deep learning algorithms.

Additionally, the context mentions other datasets, such as SNAPSHOT USA 2019, NACTI dataset, NTLNP dataset, Europe Birds, and Norway mammal, which may also utilize camera traps or other methods for collecting raw data. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in these datasets are not explicitly mentioned.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. Public datasets are mentioned, but it is not clear if they are used as a source of raw data or as a reference for comparison.

In summary, based on the provided context, camera traps are a method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, but the context does not provide information on other methods, such as surveys or sensors.
