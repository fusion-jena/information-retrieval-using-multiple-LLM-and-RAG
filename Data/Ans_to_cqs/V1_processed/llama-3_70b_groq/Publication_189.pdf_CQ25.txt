The purpose of the deep learning model is instance segmentation. This is evident from the context, which mentions Mask R-CNN, a model that combines Faster R-CNN and FCN (Fully Convolutional Networks) for instance segmentation. The model is trained to predict both the class label and the mask for each instance in the image. The context also mentions that the model is used for custom training on a dataset created from scratch, where images are collected using a fixed camera and annotated for training. The goal is to achieve instance segmentation, which involves identifying and segmenting individual objects within an image.
