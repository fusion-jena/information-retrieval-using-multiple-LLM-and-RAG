The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and clustering, but it does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used.

However, it does mention the Clustering Quality Index (CQI) in section 2.4.4, which suggests that the performance of the clustering model is evaluated using this index. But the exact definition or calculation of CQI is not provided in the context.

It's also worth noting that the context does not mention traditional deep learning metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. The context seems to be focused on unsupervised clustering using SOM, and the evaluation metrics used might be specific to this type of problem.

In summary, based on the provided context, it's not possible to determine the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
