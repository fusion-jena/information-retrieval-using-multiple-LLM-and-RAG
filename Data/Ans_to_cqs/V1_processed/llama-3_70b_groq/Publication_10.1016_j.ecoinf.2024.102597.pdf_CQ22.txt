The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this context are R2 (coefficient of determination), RMSE (root mean square error), MAE (mean absolute error), and Slope (in linear regression). These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, including RF, GBDT, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, in predicting Chla concentration and turbidity. Additionally, MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), RMSE, and MRE (mean relative error) are used to evaluate the accuracy of the input data Rrs before and after correction. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context.
