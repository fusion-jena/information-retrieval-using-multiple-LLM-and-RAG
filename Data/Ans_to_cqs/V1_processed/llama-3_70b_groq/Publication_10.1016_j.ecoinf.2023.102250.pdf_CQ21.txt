I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and components of neural networks, including convolutional kernels, attention mechanisms, and generative models. It discusses various formulas and equations related to these topics, but does not provide information on postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
