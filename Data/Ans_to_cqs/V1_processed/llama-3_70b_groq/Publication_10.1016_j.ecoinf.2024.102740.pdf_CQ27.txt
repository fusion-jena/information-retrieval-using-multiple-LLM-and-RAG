I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The text appears to be related to a study on grasslands, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on deploying a trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
