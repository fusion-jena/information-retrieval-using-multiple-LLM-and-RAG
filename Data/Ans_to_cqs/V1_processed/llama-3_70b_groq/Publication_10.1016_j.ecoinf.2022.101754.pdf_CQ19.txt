The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions various studies and papers related to estimating forest biomass using machine learning and remote sensing data, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement the deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
