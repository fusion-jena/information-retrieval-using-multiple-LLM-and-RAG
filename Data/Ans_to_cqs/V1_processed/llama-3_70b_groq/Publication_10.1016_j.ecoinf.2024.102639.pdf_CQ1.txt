Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the analysis and classification of zebrafish and rat behavior in T-maze environments using various machine learning algorithms such as KNN, SVM, and PCA-SVM. It discusses the results and comparisons of these algorithms but does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
