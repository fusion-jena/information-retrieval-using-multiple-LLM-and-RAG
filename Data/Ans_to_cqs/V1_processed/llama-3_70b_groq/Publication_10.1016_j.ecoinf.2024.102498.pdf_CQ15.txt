I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily focuses on traditional machine learning techniques, such as CART, RF, GTB, and SVM, and their hyperparameters. It also mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for LULC classification, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
