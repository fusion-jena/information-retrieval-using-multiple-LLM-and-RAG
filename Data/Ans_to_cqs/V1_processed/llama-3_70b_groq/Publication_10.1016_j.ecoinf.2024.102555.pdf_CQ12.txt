I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. The first reference mentions the integration of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural networks for flood susceptibility mapping, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. The other references are related to various topics such as ecology, remote sensing, and environmental studies, but they do not provide information about a specific deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
