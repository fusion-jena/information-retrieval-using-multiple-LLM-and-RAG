The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on few-shot learning, active learning, and prototypical learning in the context of bioacoustic applications, specifically for possum vocalization classification. It discusses the use of pre-trained feature extraction models, transfer learning, and prototypical learning for ranking sample priority. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
