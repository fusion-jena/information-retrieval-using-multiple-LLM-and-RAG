Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors employed a simple augmentation strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they flipped the patches horizontally and vertically with a 50% probability during the training stage. This augmentation strategy helps to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

Additionally, the authors experimented with various patch sizes (256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels) during the training stage, which may also help to introduce some randomness in the pipeline.

However, there is no mention of using a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the authors used a fixed random seed value or did not explicitly mention it in the provided context.
