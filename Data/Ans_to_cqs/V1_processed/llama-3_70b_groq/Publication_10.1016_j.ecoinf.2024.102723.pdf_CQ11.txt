I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and text related to deep learning, Bayesian concepts, and agriculture, but it does not provide a link to a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
