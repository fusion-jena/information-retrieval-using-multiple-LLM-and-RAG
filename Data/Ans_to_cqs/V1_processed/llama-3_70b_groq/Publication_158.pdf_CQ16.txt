According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is monitoring the validation data across training epochs. The network weights with the best performance were kept, and early stopping criteria were applied if no improvement was found in 50 epochs. This implies that the training is considered complete when the validation performance plateaus or stops improving for 50 epochs.
