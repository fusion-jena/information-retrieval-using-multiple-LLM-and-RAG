The criteria used to determine when training is complete is the highest MIoU (Mean IoU) value. According to the context, the highest MIoU value was employed to determine the point at which the DNN (Deep Neural Network) attained optimal performance. This suggests that the training process is considered complete when the model achieves the highest MIoU value, indicating optimal classification performance.
