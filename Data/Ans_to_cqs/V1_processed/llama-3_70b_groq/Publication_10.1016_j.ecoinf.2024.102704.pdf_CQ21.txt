Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of detection accuracy and inference speed by the C1 module, model complexity, and model accuracy and inference speed charts. It also mentions the division of the targeted fish species dataset into training and validation sets.

However, it does mention the calculation of metrics, such as FPS (frames per second) and memory usage, which are used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, it refers to the Supplementary Material for the introduction and calculation methodologies for each metric.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
