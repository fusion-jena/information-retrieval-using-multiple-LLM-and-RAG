I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the process followed to deploy it. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, vegetation dynamics, and kNDVI classification, but it does not provide information about model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
