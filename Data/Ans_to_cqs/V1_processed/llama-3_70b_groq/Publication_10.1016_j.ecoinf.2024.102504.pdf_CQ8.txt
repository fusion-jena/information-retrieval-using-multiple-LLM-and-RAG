I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or provide any information about the availability of a deep learning pipeline's code. The context appears to be a list of academic papers and references related to air quality, pollution, and environmental topics, but it does not include any information about code repositories or specific implementations of deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
