I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of pre-trained models such as ResNet50 and ResNet152V2, and their application to bird and amphibian vocalisations, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
