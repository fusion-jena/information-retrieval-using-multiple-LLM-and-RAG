The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation and results of the machine learning models, feature analysis, and handling missing values in the dataset. 

However, it is mentioned that cross-validation was used to assess models' reliability and avoid over-fitting. This implies that the training process might have involved some form of evaluation metric monitoring, but the specific criteria for determining training completion are not specified.
