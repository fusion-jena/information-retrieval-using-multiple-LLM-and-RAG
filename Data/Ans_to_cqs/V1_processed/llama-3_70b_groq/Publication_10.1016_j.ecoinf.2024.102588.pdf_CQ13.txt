The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

For the CNN model, the learning rate was initially set to 0.001, but it was automatically adjusted to determine the optimum point, resulting in the best performance of the CNN model. The optimizer used was not explicitly mentioned.

For the ANN model, the loss function was set as the mean squared error, and the optimizer was set as the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.

No specific hyperparameters were mentioned for the CNN model with the autoencoder.
