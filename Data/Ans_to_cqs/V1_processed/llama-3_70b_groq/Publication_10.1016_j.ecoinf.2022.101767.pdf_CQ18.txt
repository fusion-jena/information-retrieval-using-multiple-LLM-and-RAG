I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about implementing a strategy to monitor model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a study on wild bird species and their presence in online shared videos, including the analysis of video features and their correlation with the number of views. There is no mention of model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
