The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation of the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, mAp, and others. 

It can be inferred that the postprocessing steps might involve calculating these metrics to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, the context does not mention saliency maps or confusion matrices as part of the postprocessing steps. 

Therefore, the answer is that the postprocessing steps involved after model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but it is likely that metrics calculation is one of the steps.
