The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the hyper-parameter settings for model training, which are shown in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information. However, it does not provide information on the optimization method used to determine these hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
