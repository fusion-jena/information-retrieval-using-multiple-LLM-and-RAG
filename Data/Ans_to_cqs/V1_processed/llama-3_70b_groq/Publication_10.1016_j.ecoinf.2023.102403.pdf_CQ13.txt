I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to a species richness analysis, providing information about bioregions, species richness indices, and grid sizes. There is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
