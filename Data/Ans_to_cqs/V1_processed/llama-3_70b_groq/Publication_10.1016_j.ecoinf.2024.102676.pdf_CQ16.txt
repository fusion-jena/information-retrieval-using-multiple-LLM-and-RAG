I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the FIT method, which is a customized model that classifies animal trails using a robust cross-validated discriminant analysis. It explains how the model selects top explanatory variables, maps trails in two-dimensional space, and plots centroid values and confidence ellipses. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
