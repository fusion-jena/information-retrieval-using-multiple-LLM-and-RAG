I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses a proposed deep learning framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction, but it does not provide details on the specific techniques used for data augmentation. The context focuses on the architecture of the framework, the hardware and software components, and the evaluation of the model's performance, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
