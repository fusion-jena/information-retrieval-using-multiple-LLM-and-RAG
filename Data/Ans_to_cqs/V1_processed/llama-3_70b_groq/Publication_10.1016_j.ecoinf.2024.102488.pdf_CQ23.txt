The context provided does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of various machine learning models such as KNN, RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, as well as a meta-model using the RF algorithm. 

However, to ensure the generalizability of the models, the following measures were taken:

1. Cross-validation: A five-fold cross-validation was used in the RFECV process to select the optimal features and in the meta-model to generate the prediction results (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) of the training data T.

2. Diverse dataset: Although not explicitly stated, the dataset seems to be diverse, consisting of training samples and validation samples from different sources (image and field survey).

3. Stratified splitting: There is no explicit mention of stratified splitting, but the dataset is divided into training and validation samples, which could be considered as a form of splitting.

In summary, cross-validation was used to ensure the generalizability of the models, and the dataset seems to be diverse. However, there is no explicit mention of stratified splitting.
