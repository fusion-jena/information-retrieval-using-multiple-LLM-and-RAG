The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not a standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors created their own dataset of 7362 labelled images, which were used to train the deep learning CNN. Additionally, a random subsample of 400 images was taken from this dataset and labelled as "dam" or "not dam" to train a classification model. The authors also used transfer learning by initialising an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model, but this is not the primary dataset used for training.
