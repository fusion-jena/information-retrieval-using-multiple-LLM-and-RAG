I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models, preprocessing steps, normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be related to the FAIR principles for data management, the F-UJI tool, and its application to evaluate the compliance of datasets with these principles. It discusses the analysis of datasets, visualization of results, and the importance of making datasets machine-readable. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
