The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is time series prediction, specifically forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario. The model used is a type of recurrent neural network called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is well-suited for time series prediction tasks. The LSTM model is used to predict the ecological water demand of the oasis based on input data, but the exact details of the input data and the specific prediction task are not provided in the given context.
