Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on synthetic data generation, machine learning methods, and data utility metrics. It does not provide information on data collection methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association) satellite and information service, which might imply the use of satellite data collection. Additionally, the context discusses coral reef-related data, which could be collected through various methods such as underwater sensors, surveys, or public datasets. However, this is speculative, and the context does not provide explicit information on data collection methods.

In summary, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
