The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the dataset includes raw and segmented images, suggesting that some form of image segmentation might have been used. 

The context mentions that the dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species, and that six different commercial cameras were used to ensure variability. It also mentions that the models were fine-tuned with raw and segmented images, but it does not provide details on how the segmentation was done.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, based on the provided context.
