The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the framework of the bird sound noise reduction network shown in Fig. 4, it can be inferred that the model might be a type of neural network, possibly a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) or a deep autoencoder (DAE), but this is not explicitly stated.
