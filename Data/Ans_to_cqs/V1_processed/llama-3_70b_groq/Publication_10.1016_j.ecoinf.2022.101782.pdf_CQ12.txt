The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, two CNNs are used: a ResNet101 object detection model and a ResNet50 red kite model. The ResNet101 model is used for object detection, and the ResNet50 model is trained specifically for the target species, red kites.
