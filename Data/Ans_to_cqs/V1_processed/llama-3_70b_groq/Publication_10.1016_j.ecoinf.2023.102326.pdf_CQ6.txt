Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the construction of complex networks from large-scale acoustic data and the analysis of the urban acoustic environment. It discusses the use of FCM, thresholding, and adjacency matrix to represent the network, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
