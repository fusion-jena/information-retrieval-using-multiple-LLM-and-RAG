The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the training data is separated into training and validation groups, which suggests that some form of data splitting or partitioning was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of early stopping and dropout as regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, which can also help improve the model's generalizability. However, without further information, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
