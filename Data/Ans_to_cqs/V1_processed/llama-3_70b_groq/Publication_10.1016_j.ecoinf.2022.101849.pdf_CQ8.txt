I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing various topics in machine learning, ecology, and biogeography, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
