The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "some preprocessing steps like data augmentation and normalization are performed to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks." 

This suggests that data augmentation is used to address data imbalance problems, but it does not provide further details on other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. Additionally, there is no mention of diverse data collection as a technique to address data bias. Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that data augmentation and normalization are used to address data imbalance problems, but we cannot provide information on other techniques.
