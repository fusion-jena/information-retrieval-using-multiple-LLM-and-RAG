The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture and hyperparameters of the MLP model, but it does not specify the framework used to implement it. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used to build the model.
