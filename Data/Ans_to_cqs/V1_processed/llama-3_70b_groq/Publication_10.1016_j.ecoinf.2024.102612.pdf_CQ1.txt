Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected using Multispectral LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology. LiDAR is a remote sensing method that uses laser light to scan and create high-resolution 3D point clouds of the environment. In this case, the LiDAR data is multispectral, meaning it captures reflectance values at distinct wavelengths.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data. The context suggests that the LiDAR data is collected directly from the environment, possibly using an airborne or terrestrial LiDAR system.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide detailed information on the specific LiDAR system or setup used for data collection. However, it is clear that LiDAR is the primary method used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.
