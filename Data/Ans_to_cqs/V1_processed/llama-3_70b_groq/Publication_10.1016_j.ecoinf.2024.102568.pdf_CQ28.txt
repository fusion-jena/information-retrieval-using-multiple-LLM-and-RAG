I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the HypeAIR framework, the database structure, and various machine learning and deep learning algorithms used for sensor calibration, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
