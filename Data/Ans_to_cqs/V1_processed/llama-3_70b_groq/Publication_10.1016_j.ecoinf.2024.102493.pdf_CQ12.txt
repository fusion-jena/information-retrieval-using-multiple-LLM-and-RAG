I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model being used in the pipeline. The context appears to be related to vegetation classification and trend analysis using kNDVI, and it mentions various statistical methods and tools such as the F test, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), and Geodetector. However, it does not mention a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The only mention of a model is an LSTM time series NDVI prediction method, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), but it is not clear if this is part of the pipeline being referred to.
