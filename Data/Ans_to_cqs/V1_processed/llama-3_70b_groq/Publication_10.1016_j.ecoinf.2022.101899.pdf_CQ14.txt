I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach, prior distributions, and correlation between model parameters, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
