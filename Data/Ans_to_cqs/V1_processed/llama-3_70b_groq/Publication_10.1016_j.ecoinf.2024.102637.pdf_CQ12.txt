The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of AlexNet, which is a well-known CNN architecture, being used as the backbone model in the proposed SIAlex model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional layers and residual connection techniques, which are common components of CNNs. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
