I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to data analysis, specifically tracking vocalizations of different song structures, and presents a table with the number and percentage of tracks for each song variant. There is no mention of a deep learning model or its application. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model based on the provided context.
