The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The study appears to focus on using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for species distribution modeling (SDM) in the Himalayas, specifically for tracking and mapping Rhododendron arboreum. The dataset used in this study is likely to be satellite-based observations and ecological data related to the species, but the exact dataset is not specified.
