Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, model initialization, training, and testing procedures for cross-herbarium transfer learning. It discusses the different experiments conducted, the datasets used, and the accuracy results obtained. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
