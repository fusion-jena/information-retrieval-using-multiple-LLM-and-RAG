Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.

The context mentions the calculation of various metrics such as F1-Score, Accuracy, Kappa, and F1_Ave, which suggests that these metrics were calculated after model training to evaluate the performance of the models.

Additionally, the context provides a confusion matrix (Table 2) for the ensemble CNN, which is a common postprocessing step used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps, which are a type of visualization technique used to interpret the output of a model. Therefore, it is unclear whether saliency maps were involved in the postprocessing steps.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training appear to include metrics calculation and the creation of a confusion matrix, but it is unclear whether saliency maps were involved.
