The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the values of certain hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and object queries parameter, but it does not explain how these values were chosen. 

It can be inferred that the authors may have used a trial-and-error approach or a manual tuning process to select the hyperparameters, but there is no indication of a systematic search method such as grid search or random search being used. Therefore, the answer to this query is unknown based on the provided context.
