I don't know.

The provided context does not mention optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The context is focused on the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, to predict reproductive condition in fish. It discusses the use of machine learning algorithms in ecology, genetics, and climate change, but does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
