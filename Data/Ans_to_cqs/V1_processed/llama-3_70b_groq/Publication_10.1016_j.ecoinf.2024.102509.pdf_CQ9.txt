I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, land use/land cover classification, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The mentioned sources, such as World Agroforestry Centre databases, Remote Sensing of Environment, and Ecological Informatics, do not seem to be related to a deep learning pipeline or its data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
