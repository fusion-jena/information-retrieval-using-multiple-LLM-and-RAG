The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. The authors mention that they used a Keras implementation of EfficientNet–B4 called EfficientNet V1.1.0, which is available at https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet. Additionally, they also provide a link to the pre-trained network weights (EfficientNet–B4) at https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/blob/master/efficientnet/weights.py.
