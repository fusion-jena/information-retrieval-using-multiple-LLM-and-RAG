The provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing the use of NAIP imagery and various bands (R, G, B, and IR) for image classification, along with techniques like multi-resolution segmentation and multi-threshold segmentation. There is no mention of deep learning or any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
