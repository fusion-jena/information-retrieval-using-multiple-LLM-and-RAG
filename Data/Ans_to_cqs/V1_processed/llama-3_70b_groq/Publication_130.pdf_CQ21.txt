The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the data collection process, image classification algorithm, and training process, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not mention saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, which are common postprocessing steps in machine learning.
