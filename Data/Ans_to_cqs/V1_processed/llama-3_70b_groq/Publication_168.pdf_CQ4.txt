Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the different deep learning architectures and methods used for HSI classification tasks, such as CNNs, 1-D-CNN, multiscale CNN, LSTM, and residual networks. It discusses the various techniques used to extract spectral and spatial features from HSI data, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
