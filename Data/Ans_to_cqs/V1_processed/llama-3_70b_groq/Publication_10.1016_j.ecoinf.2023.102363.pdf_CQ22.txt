The performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are Precision (P), Recall (R), F1 Score, and Mean AUC (Roc curve). These metrics are calculated based on the number of true and false positive detections, and true and false negative detections. The formulas for Precision and Recall are provided in the context as:

P = NTP / (NTP + NFP)
R = NTP / (NTP + NFN)

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. Additionally, the Mean AUC (Roc curve) is also used as a performance metric.
