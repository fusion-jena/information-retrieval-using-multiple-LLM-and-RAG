The context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the REVIS IoT hardware for data collection in the hardware layer of the proposed framework. This suggests that sensors are likely used to collect raw data, but the specific type of sensors is not specified. There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for data collection.
