Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. The context discusses the architecture of the model, including the use of convolutional layers, pooling layers, LRN, and fully connected layers, as well as the sizes of the output results at various stages. It also mentions the inspiration from other models such as GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and LeNet. However, it does not specify the task or problem that the model is intended to solve, such as classification, segmentation, detection, or regression. Therefore, I don't know the purpose of the deep learning model.
