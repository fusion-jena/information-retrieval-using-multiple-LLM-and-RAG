The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection, specifically species identification in images. The model is used to identify and classify species within images, which is a common task in ecology and computer vision. The use of Faster R-CNN, a popular object detection architecture, and techniques like ROI pooling and data augmentation further support this conclusion. The model is trained to analyze specific regions within images and accurately classify objects (species) within those regions.
