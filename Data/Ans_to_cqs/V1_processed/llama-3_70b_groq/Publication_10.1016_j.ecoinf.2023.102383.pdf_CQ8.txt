I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of various deep learning models, including ResNet and Faster R-CNN, for object detection tasks. It provides details about the models, their architectures, and their performance on different datasets, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code is available.
