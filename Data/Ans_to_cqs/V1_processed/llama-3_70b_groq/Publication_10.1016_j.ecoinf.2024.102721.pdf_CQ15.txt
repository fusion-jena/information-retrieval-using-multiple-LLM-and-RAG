The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text only discusses the use of deep learning methods, specifically LSTM models, for forecasting ecological water demand. It also mentions Bayesian optimization, but it is not clear if this is used as an optimization technique in the deep learning pipeline or for a different purpose. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
