I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental data, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
