I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the optimization of data structures for machine learning classification, hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
