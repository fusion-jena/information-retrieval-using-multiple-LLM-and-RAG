Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and optimization of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their applications in semi-supervised clustering and representation learning.

However, it can be inferred that the context is related to acoustic data, possibly from biodiversity assessment or environmental monitoring, as mentioned in the reference "Rowe, B., Eichinski, P., Zhang, J., Roe, P., 2021. Acoustic auto-encoders for biodiversity assessment." This might suggest that sensors or audio recorders could be used to collect raw acoustic data.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this query.
