I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article or paper discussing the development and evaluation of a deep learning model for air quality monitoring and prediction. The context includes figures, tables, and text discussing the model's architecture, performance, and scalability, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
