Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, transfer learning, and the challenges of deep CNNs. It discusses the hardware and software tools used, the dataset division, and the application of transfer learning using pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular case, as they are not mentioned in the provided context.
