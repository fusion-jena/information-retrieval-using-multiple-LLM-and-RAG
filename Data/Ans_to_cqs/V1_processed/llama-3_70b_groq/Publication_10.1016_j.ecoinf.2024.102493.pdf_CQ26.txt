I don't know. The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses topics such as OPGD, Q values, factor detectors, and PLS-SEM, but it does not mention deep learning or data bias mitigation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
