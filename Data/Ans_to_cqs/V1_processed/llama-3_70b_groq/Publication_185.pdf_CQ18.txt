The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored using a validation set, as the results of the model on the validation set are mentioned in the text. The model was trained until it reached 6900 iterations, and the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10 every 69 iterations. This suggests that the model performance was monitored during training, and the learning rate was adjusted accordingly. However, the specific strategy or metric used to monitor the model performance is not mentioned.
