The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it can be inferred that some postprocessing steps were performed, as the context mentions the calculation of performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f1-score, as well as the creation of confusion matrices.

It is likely that metrics calculation and confusion matrix creation were part of the postprocessing steps, as these are common steps in evaluating the performance of machine learning models. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the postprocessing steps involved after model training likely include metrics calculation and confusion matrix creation, but the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps.
