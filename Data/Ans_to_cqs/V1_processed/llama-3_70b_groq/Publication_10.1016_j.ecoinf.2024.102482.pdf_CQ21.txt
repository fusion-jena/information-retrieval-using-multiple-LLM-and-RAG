The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It only mentions that "after the training is completed, the trained model is used to predict water conditions and analyze performance using the test data set that was not employed during the learning stage." 

However, it does mention the performance metrics in section 2.4.5, but it does not provide details on the postprocessing steps. It only explains how the learned monitoring system uses the given pattern sequence sample as input to each HMM to calculate probability values and compares the probability values to determine contamination or contaminants.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, as this information is not provided in the given context.
