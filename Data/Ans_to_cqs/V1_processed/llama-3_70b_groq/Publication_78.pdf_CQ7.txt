Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to focus on explaining various concepts related to machine learning, such as the Gaussian kernel, confusion matrix, and k-means clustering algorithm, as well as presenting performance comparisons of different classifiers and deep learning models. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data randomly into training, testing, and validation sets
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into sets while maintaining the same class distribution as the original dataset
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k folds, using k-1 folds for training and one fold for testing, and repeating this process k times

Without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact criteria used in this particular context.
