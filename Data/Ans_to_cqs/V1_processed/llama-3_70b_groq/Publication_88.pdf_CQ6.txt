Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the EF network, the training setup, and the influence of the number of training samples on the model's performance. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training. These steps may include normalization or scaling of the input data, handling missing values, data augmentation, and feature scaling. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular case.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in this context.
