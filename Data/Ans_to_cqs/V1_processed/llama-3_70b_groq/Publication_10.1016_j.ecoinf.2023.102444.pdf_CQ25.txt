The purpose of the deep learning model in the mentioned context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the provided information, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for species distribution modeling (SDM). Specifically, it is used to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution, as mentioned in the context of Deneu et al. (2022). 

It is likely that the deep learning model is used for classification, as it is common in SDM to classify areas as suitable or unsuitable for a species based on bioclimatic variables. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model with certainty.
