I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a series of numbers and references to an academic paper, but it does not contain any information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
