Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of bird detection using camera traps and the performance of various deep learning models for bird identification. It discusses the impact of dataset noise, environmental clutter, and model training times on the accuracy of bird detection, but it does not address the specific topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
