Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on land use change, land cover, and ecosystem services, with mentions of deep learning models such as LSTM and DynaCLUE, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
