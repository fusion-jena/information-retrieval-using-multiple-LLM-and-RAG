I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision models, specifically the Faster R-CNN model, for automating data processing tasks in wildlife camera trap studies. It highlights the benefits and limitations of using AI tools for image analysis, but does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
