The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not a deep learning model, but rather an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, specifically a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. This is mentioned in the text as "The BP-ANN used here entailed an input layer with n co-variates, two hidden layers consisting of p hidden neurons, and one output layer having one output neuron." This is a type of feedforward neural network, not a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
