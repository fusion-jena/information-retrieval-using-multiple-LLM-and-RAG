I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water using machine learning and deep learning methods, and it discusses various research papers and models used for this task. There is no mention of datasets typically used in computer vision or image processing tasks, which are the domains where MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are commonly used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
