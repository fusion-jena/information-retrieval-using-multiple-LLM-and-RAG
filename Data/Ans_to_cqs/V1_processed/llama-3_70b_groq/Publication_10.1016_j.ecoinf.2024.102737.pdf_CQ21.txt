Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, training and testing sets, and precision results of the upper-, left-, and right-pose models. It also discusses the initial experiments, their evaluation, and the directions for improvement.

However, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved, as the precision results are reported in Table 3 for different measures (P1, P3, P5, and P6). Additionally, the text mentions the evaluation of the initial experiments results, which might involve some form of performance metrics calculation.

But, there is no mention of specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
