I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and acoustic monitoring for biodiversity monitoring, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model.

The paper by Chalmers et al. (2021) mentions the use of deep learning for acoustic monitoring, but it does not provide details on the evaluation metrics used. The other papers and references provided do not seem to be directly related to the evaluation of deep learning models.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query, and I do not want to make an assumption or provide an incorrect answer.
