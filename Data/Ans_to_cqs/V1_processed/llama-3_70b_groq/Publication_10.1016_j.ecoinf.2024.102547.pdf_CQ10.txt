Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context only provides information about the authors' contributions, data availability, and acknowledgments, but it does not include any information about a code repository or a link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
