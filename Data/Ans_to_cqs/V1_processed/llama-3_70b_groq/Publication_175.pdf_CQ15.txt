The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only discusses the architectures and methods used, such as ResNet, CNN, and optimization-based few-shot learning algorithms, but it does not specify the optimization techniques employed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
