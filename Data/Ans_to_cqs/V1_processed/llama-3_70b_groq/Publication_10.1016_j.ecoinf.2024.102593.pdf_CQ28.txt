I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the BirdNET-Analyzer v2.1 models, the NIPS4Bplus dataset, and various research papers related to deep learning and bioacoustics, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
