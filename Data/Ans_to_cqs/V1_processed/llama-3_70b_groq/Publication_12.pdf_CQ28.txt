I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was trained using a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU, Nvidia 1080ti, US) for two hours and 10 minutes, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
