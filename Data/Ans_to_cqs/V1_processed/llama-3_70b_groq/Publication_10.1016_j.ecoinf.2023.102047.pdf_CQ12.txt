Based on the provided context, it appears that various deep learning models are used in different pipelines. Specifically, the following models are mentioned:

* CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is used in several pipelines, including the one proposed by Perez et al. (2020) for mapping seagrass distribution.
* DCN (Deep Capsule Network) is used by Perez et al. (2020) as an alternative to CNN for mapping seagrass distribution.
* Encoder-Decoder model is used by Wang et al. (2020a) to estimate seagrass coverage.
* Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) is used by Noman et al. (2021b) for object detection.
* EfficientDet is mentioned as a popular object detection model, but it is not clear if it is used in a specific pipeline.
* RPN (Region Proposal Network) is used in the Faster R-CNN model to predict candidate bounding boxes.
* NASNet is used in combination with Faster R-CNN by Noman et al. (2021b) for object detection.

It is not possible to identify a single type of deep learning model used in "the" pipeline, as different models are used in different pipelines.
