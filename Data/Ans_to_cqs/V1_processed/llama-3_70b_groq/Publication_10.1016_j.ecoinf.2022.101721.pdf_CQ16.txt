I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are typically concepts used in machine learning. The context appears to be discussing statistical modeling, Bayesian algorithms, and data analysis, but it does not provide any information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
