The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It focuses on the model training process, k-fold cross-validation, and the evaluation metrics used, such as YOLO training losses and mAP50 values. 

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as mAP50, which indicates the model's ability to correctly predict labels. Additionally, the context mentions the investigation of YOLO training losses, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated during the training process.

There is no mention of postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined what specific postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
