Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. 10-fold cross-validation: This step is used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function, which provides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observations.

2. Confusion matrix calculation: A confusion matrix is generated for the test data not seen during training, as shown in Fig. 9. This matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the classification model.

No mention is made of saliency maps or metrics calculation in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these steps are involved in the postprocessing pipeline.
