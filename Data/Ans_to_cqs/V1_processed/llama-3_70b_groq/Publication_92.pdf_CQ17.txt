Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the network, the addition of new classes, and the post-processing and bounding box fusion steps. It does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
