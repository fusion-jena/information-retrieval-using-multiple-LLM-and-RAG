The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that all images were centre cropped to an equally sized rectangle, which can be considered a preprocessing step.

Additionally, the context mentions that the training set was augmented in the following ways: flipped horizontally, flipped vertically, adjusted in brightness (12.5%), adjusted in saturation (50.0%), adjusted by contrast (12.5%), and adjusted in hue (20%). These augmentations can also be considered as preprocessing steps to increase the robustness and generalizability of the classifier.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information about other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these steps were involved before training the deep learning model.
