I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing various topics such as vegetation indices (MSAVI), machine learning algorithms (LightGBM), hyperparameter optimization, and remote sensing applications. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
