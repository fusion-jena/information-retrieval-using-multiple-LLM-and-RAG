I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to the conservation of orchids and the use of machine learning models for this purpose, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization method used for hyperparameters. It mentions the use of Bayesian neural networks and IUC-NN, but it does not elaborate on the optimization process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
