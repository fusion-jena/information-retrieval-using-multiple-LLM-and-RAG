I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or splitting data into train, test, and validation sets. The context appears to be related to a study on using a mobile app for monitoring marine taxa, and it discusses the methodology, data collection, and analysis of the data. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning models, or how the data was split for training and testing. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
