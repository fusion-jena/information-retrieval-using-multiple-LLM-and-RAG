The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques used during training, which include:

* Image scaling
* Horizontal and vertical flip
* Perspective distortion
* Adding color jitter for brightness, contrast, and saturation

These augmentation techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training data and mitigate overfitting. However, it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps that may have been performed before training the deep learning model.
