The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context only mentions two phases: the first phase involves building a classification model by training a CNN on a given database T0, and the second phase involves tuning a risk threshold Ï„i specific to each class using a second and independent database T1. 

It does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
