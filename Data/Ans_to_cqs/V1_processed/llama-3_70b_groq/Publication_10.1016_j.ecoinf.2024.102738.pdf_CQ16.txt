The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on land use and land cover (LULC) classification, landscape fragmentation, and rate of change analysis using ArcGIS and Google Earth Engine (GEE). It discusses the classification accuracy according to the kappa index, the use of the Landscape Fragmentation Tool, and the sampling size and validation areas for categorical variables. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria for determining its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
