I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a research paper on fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. It discusses the methodology of fire risk mapping, validation of accuracy, and classification of fire risk maps into different susceptibility classes. There is no mention of training or machine learning concepts, which are typically associated with the concept of validation loss plateau. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
