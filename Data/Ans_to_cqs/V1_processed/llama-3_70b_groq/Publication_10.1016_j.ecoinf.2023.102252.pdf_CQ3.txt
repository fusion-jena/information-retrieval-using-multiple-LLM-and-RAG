I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research article about developing a computationally efficient floodplain ecological response model for large-scale, data-sparse riparian environments. The keywords mentioned are environmental flow, riparian ecosystem, wetland, and biodiversity maintenance, which are unrelated to data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
