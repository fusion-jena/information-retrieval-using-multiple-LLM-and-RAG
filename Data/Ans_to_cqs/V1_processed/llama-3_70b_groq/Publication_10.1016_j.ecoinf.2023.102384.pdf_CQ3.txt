Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique is mentioned in Fig. 3, where bounding boxes are generated by creating squares centered over the dots with a fixed side length s.

2. Density map annotation: This technique is also mentioned in Fig. 3, where density maps are produced by overlaying Gaussian kernels GÏƒ centered at the dot positions.

3. Segmentation map annotation: This technique is mentioned in Fig. 3, where segmentation maps are generated by superimposing dot-centered discs having radius r and splitting overlapping discs using a background ridge.

4. Dot labeling: This technique is mentioned in Fig. 3, where ground-truth is derived from dot labels by leveraging distinct procedures depending on the specific deep learning model being employed.

These annotation techniques are used to prepare the ground-truth data required for the training phase of deep learning models in the context of agricultural pest detection and counting.
