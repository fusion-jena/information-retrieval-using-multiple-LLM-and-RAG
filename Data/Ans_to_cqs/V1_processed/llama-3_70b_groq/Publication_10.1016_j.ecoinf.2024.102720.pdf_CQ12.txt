I don't know.

The provided context mentions "deep learning algorithm" in the first sentence, and "deep learning" again in the last paragraph, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. There is no mention of CNN, RNN, Transformer, or any other specific type of deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
