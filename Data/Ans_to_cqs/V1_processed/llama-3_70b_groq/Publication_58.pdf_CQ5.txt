The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of deep learning techniques for land use and land cover (LULC) classification from satellite images, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used. It only mentions "benchmark datasets" in general terms, without specifying which ones. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
