I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, providing a list of categories for classifying land cover types, and discussing a scoring scale for permeability. There is no mention of deep learning models or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
