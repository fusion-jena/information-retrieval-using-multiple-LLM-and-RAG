The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture of the model, which includes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with two Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers, and mentions the hyperparameters used for training the model. However, it does not specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
