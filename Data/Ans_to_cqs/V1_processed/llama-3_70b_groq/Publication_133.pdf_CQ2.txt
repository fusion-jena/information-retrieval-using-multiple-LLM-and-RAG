Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The text mentions "classification of images" and "extracting information from them", indicating that images are the primary data type being used. Additionally, the mention of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and object detection methods like Faster R-CNN and YOLO further supports the idea that image data is being used. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
