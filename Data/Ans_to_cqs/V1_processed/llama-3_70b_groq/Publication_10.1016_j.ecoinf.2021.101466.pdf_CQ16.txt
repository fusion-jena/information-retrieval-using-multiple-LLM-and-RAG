Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the importance of creating effective variation in training data, applying random erasing to the training dataset, and using EfficientNet and YOLOv4 models for object detection. However, it does not provide information about the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or number of epochs.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
