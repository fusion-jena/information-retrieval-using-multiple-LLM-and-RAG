The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, but it does discuss methods for ensuring the generalizability of a statistical prediction model. According to the text, one of the measures taken is k-fold cross-validation. This method splits the full dataset into k approximately equally-sized disjoint subsets or folds, where the model is calibrated on k-1 folds, and the remaining fold is used for assessing prediction accuracy. The overall cross-validation accuracy is estimated by aggregating the residuals over the k folds.

Additionally, the context mentions that in machine learning, a common approach is to randomly divide the full dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. This approach can also help ensure the generalizability of the model by using separate datasets for model fitting, model selection and hyperparameter tuning, and final model evaluation.

There is no mention of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
