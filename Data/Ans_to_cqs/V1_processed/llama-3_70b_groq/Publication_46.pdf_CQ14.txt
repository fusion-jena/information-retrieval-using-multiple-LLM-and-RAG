Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the architecture of the neural network, including the use of convolution for feature extraction and the SoftMax function in the final layer, as well as the BIOCLIM model and its limitations. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as the use of grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
