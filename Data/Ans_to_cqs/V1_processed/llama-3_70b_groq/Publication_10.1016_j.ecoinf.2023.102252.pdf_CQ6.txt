Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental flow, riparian ecosystem, and wetland biodiversity maintenance, and discusses parameters and variables related to a model, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
