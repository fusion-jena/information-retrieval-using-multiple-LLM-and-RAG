I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context mentions the use of deep learning models, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
