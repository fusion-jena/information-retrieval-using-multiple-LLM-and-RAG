I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, spatial analysis, and conservation zone assessment, with mentions of principal component analysis, habitat quality assessment, and ecological risk assessment. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
