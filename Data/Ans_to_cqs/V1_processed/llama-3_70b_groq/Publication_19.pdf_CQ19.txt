The deep learning model is built using Keras, which is a high-level neural networks API. Although Keras is not explicitly mentioned as a framework, it is mentioned that "The models were implemented using Keras (https://keras.io/)." 

Additionally, TensorFlow is also mentioned as a framework, specifically TensorFlow Lite, which is used to convert the trained Inception-V3 model to a smaller size for edge computing deployment.
