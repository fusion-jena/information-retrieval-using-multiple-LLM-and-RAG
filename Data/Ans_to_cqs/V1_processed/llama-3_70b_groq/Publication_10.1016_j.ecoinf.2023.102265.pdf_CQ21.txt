Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the manual classification algorithm, automatic classifier, and insect microhabitat studies. It also provides details about the model architecture, such as the ResNet-50 structure and the SVM classifier. Additionally, it compares the performance of the proposed method with softmax on CPU and GPU. However, it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
