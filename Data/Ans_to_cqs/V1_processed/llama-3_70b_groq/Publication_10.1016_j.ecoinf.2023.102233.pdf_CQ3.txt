The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on bird call recognition using deep convolutional neural networks, active learning strategies, and bioacoustic classification. 

However, it can be inferred that the annotation technique used in this study involves labeling bird calls into different categories, as the context mentions "human-model annotation performance" and "the final model's predictions most closely reflected the primary annotator's labels." This suggests that the annotation technique involves categorizing or labeling audio data, but the specific technique is not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the exact data annotation technique used in this study, but it appears to involve labeling audio data for bird call recognition.
