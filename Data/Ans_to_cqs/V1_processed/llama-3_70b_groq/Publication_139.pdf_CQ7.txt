The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that three randomly selected days from each month of the calendar year were selected for annotation, which suggests that the data was split into different sets for training and possibly testing or validation. 

Additionally, the context mentions "five training folds" in section 2.6, which implies that the data was split into five folds for cross-validation, where one fold is used for validation and the remaining four folds are used for training. However, the exact criteria used to split the data into these folds are not specified.

In summary, while the context provides some hints about the data splitting process, it does not provide explicit criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
