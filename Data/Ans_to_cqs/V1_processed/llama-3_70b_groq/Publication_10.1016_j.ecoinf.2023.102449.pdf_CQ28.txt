I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the architecture and design of the model, including the use of wide residual networks, convolutional neural networks, and batch normalization. It also discusses the pre-processing block and the layout of the encoder, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
