I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text appears to be an abstract or introduction to a research article in the field of ecological informatics, discussing the variability of animal abundances across space and time. The keywords listed include machine learning, but there is no mention of specific deep learning frameworks or models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which frameworks are used to build a deep learning model based on the provided context.
