The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on citing various research papers related to deep learning, weed recognition, and precision farming. It discusses the importance of addressing data distribution shifts in machine learning systems, but it does not provide specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

However, it is worth noting that some of the cited papers might indirectly relate to addressing data bias. For instance, the paper on "Unsupervised domain adaptation of object detectors: A survey" might touch upon techniques for adapting to new domains, which could be related to addressing data bias. Similarly, the paper on "Domain randomization for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world" might discuss techniques for randomizing domains to reduce bias.

Unfortunately, without further information or direct references to specific techniques, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. Therefore, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
