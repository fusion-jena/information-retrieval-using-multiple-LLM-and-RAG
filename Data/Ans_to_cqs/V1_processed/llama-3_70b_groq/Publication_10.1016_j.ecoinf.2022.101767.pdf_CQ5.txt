The provided context does not mention the use of any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study analyzing online videos of wild birds, where the data extraction involves classifying thumbnail characteristics and recording information about the videos, such as the number of subscribers, bird species, and target places. The data analysis is performed using R software with various packages, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any specific datasets typically used in deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
