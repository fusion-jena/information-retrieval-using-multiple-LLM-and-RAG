I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the impact of urban development on species distribution, and it does not provide any information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository is available.
