I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses machine learning algorithms like random forests, support vector machines, and their applications in supervised learning for animal behavior classification based on ACC data. It does not provide information about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
