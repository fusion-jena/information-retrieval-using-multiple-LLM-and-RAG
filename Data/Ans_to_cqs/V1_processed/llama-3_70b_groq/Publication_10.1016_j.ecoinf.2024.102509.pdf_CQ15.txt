I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for regression analysis, particularly in the context of predicting above-ground biomass. It discusses the architecture of the ANN model, the selection of hidden layers and neurons, and the performance evaluation of different regression methods. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used to train the ANN model.
