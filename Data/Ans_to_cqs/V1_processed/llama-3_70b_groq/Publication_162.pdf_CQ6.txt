According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include normalization. Specifically, all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) are normalized by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. This is mentioned in the text as a step taken before training the D-Mask R-CNN architecture. 

No other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training dataset is augmented with additional images obtained from Internet image search engines, and that filtering different types of label noise is required to improve the recognition performance of the system.
