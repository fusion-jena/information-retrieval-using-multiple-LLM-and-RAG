I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on the application of LiDAR data and deep learning techniques in forest ecology, particularly in the Amazon region. It discusses the use of LiDAR point clouds, image transformation, and deep learning techniques to analyze forest structure and its relationship with terrain variation. However, it does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
