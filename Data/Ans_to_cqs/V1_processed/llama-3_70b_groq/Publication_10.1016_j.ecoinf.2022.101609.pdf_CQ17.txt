The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that further training beyond 20,000 epochs would have either resulted in overfitting or no further drop in both losses, indicating that the model was learning. This suggests that the authors were aware of the risk of overfitting and took steps to prevent it, but the specific regularization methods used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in this deep learning pipeline.
