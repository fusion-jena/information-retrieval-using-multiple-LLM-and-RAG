Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through underwater images or videos. The context mentions "baited video stations" and "diver video transects" as methods for collecting data on fish assemblages. Additionally, the text mentions "thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species and environment" being used to train the deep learning model. This suggests that the raw data is collected through visual observations or recordings of fish in their natural habitats.

It does not appear that surveys, sensors, or public datasets are explicitly mentioned as methods for collecting raw data in this specific context. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in other deep learning pipelines or applications.

In summary, the raw data for this deep learning pipeline is likely collected through underwater visual observations or recordings, but the exact methods used are not fully specified in the provided context.
