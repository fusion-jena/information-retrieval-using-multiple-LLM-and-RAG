I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are mostly academic papers, books, and websites related to ecology, remote sensing, and geographic information systems. There is no mention of a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, where the deep learning pipeline data might be stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
