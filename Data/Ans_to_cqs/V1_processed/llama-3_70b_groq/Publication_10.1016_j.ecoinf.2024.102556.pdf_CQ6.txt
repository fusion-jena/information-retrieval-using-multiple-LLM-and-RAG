Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) and its application in the Deep SORT algorithm for multi-object tracking. It discusses the shortcomings of traditional residual structures and the benefits of introducing Res2Net modules and group convolution for refining multiscale representation. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
