The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text discusses the data acquisition and processing steps, including filtering out invalid tweets, but it does not delve into the specifics of model training or data splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
