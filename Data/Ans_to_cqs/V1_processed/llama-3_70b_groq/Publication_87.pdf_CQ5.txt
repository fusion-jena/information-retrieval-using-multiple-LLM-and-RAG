The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text mentions a dataset of labelled images used for model training and validation, and a new dataset of unlabelled images used for prediction, but it does not specify the names of these datasets. It does cite papers related to ImageNet, but it does not explicitly state that ImageNet is the dataset used in this particular pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the specific datasets used in this deep learning pipeline.
