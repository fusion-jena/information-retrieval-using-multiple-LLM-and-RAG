Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to a plant identification study, and it discusses the dataset, model architecture, and experimental setup, but it does not provide information about the training process or the criteria for determining when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
