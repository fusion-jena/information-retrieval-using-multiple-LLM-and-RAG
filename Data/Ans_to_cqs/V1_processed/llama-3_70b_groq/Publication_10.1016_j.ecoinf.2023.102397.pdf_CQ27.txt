Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses various topics such as species distribution modeling, acoustic indices, bird diversity, and automatic rain and cicada chorus filtering, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context does mention the use of deep neural networks and their performance improvement with an increase in the number of hidden layers, but it does not elaborate on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
