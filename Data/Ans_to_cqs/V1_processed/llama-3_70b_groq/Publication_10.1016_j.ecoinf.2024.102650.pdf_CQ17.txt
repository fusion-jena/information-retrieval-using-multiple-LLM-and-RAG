The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on text processing, data cleaning, and theme perception technology, including Chinese text segmentation, lexical analysis, and machine learning models like ERNIE and LDA. It does not discuss deep learning pipelines or regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
