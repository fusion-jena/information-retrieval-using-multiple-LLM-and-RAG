I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of machine learning methods, such as artificial neural networks, random forest, and maximum entropy modeling, in ecological informatics and insect forest risk assessment. It does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
