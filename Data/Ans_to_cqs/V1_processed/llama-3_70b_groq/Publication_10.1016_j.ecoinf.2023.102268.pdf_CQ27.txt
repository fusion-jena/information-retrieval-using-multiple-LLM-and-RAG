I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the feature extraction and classification workflows, including the use of ResNet-50 and SVM classifier, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
