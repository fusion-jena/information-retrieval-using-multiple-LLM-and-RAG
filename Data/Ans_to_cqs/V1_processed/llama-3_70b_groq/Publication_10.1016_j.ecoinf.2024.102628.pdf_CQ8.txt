I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and techniques used in the research, including the use of the fast.ai platform and the ResNet-34 architecture, but it does not provide information about where the code is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the code repository of the deep learning pipeline.
