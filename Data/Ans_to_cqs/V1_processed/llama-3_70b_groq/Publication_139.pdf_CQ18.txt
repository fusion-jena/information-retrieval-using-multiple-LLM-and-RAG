The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using classification accuracy and F1-scores.

The context mentions that the average unweighted and category-weighted training classification accuracies are 98.9% and 97.4%, respectively. Additionally, the F1-scores for the training and testing datasets are reported as 0.980 and 0.907, respectively. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using these metrics during training.

However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training, such as validation curves or learning curves, is not mentioned in the provided context.
