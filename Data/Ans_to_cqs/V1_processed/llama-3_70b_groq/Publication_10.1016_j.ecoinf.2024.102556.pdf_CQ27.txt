Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance comparison of the SORT model and the Deep SORT model using FENs, and the architecture of the YOLOv7 model. It does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
