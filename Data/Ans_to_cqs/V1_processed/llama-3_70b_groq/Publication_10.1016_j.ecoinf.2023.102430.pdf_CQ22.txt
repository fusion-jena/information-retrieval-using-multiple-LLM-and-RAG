The query asks about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. According to the provided context, the performance of the algorithms is evaluated using identification accuracy and specificity. These metrics are assessed using logit-binomial generalized linear mixed models fit in a Bayesian framework. 

Specifically, the context mentions that the predicted accuracies of the Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HB) algorithm ranged from ~0.987 to >0.999, and the AdaBoost (AB) algorithm had poor accuracy for Rhodnius and Panstrongylus but high accuracy for Triatoma. This suggests that accuracy is one of the primary metrics used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.

However, there is no mention of precision and recall as evaluation metrics in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy and specificity are the primary metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, but it is unclear if precision and recall are also used.
