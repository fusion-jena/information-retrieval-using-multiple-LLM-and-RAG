I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or techniques to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, seagrass species, and data acquisition and preparation for random forest classification. There is no mention of deep learning or neural networks, which are typically associated with regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
