The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the pipeline of the framework, which involves computing geometric partition, converting each partition into a superpoint, and segmenting the point clouds based on context with a graph convolution network. It also discusses the regularization parameter l and its impact on the partition results.

There is no mention of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are common data annotation techniques used in computer vision tasks. The context seems to focus more on point cloud processing and segmentation, rather than image-based annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
