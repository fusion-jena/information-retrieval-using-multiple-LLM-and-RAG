I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context discusses the PLUS model, which consists of two main modules: the transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). It also mentions the use of a random forest algorithm in the LEAS module, but does not provide information about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
