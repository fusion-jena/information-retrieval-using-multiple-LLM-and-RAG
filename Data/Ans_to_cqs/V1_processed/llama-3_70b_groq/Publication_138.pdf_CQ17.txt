Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting mentioned are maximum pooling and Local Response Normalization (LRN). Maximum pooling is used to reduce the number of parameters and prevent overfitting. LRN is used to normalize the local response, which enhances the larger response value and reduces the smaller response value, thus improving the generalization of the model.

However, the context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization as regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. It is possible that these methods may be used in deep learning pipelines, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
