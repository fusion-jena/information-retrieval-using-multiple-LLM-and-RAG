The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the importance of cleaning and filtering processes to focus on relevant data, which is a characteristic of big data.

In the context of the tweet detection algorithm, the preprocessing steps mentioned include:

1. Eliminating tweets that contain images in GIF format, which are often memes.
2. Filtering out retweets to only consider original tweets.
3. Using specific queries to search for tweets that express interesting finds, such as "who knows", "what is this", or "I/we have found".

While these steps are related to data preprocessing, they are specific to the tweet detection algorithm and do not provide a general answer to the query about preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
