Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically remote sensing images. This is inferred from the mentions of Sentinel-2 data, UAV data, and remote sensing images in the context. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a format commonly used for tabular data, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the context as being used in the deep learning pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context does not explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline, but it does discuss the use of remote sensing images and data processing in QGIS, which could be part of a larger pipeline. However, without more information, it's difficult to say for certain what data formats are being used in a deep learning pipeline.
