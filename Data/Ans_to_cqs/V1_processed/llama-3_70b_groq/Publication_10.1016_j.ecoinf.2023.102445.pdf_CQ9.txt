I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing a deep learning model called YOLO_MRC, its architecture, and its performance in various experiments. The context includes figures, tables, and descriptions of the model's components and experimental results, but it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
