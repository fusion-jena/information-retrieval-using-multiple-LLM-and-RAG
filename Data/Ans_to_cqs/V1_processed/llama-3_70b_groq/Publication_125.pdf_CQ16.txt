Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the training and prediction run-times of different models, the dataset used, and the experimental set-up, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, validation accuracy plateau, or reaching a maximum number of epochs. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine which criterion was used in this specific research.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
