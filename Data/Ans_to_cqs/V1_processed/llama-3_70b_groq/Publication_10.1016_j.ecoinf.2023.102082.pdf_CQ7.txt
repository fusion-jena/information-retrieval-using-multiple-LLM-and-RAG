Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning approaches for forest biodiversity monitoring, forest fuels classification, and vegetation structure characteristics modeling. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks, Sentinel-2 images, and GEDI CHMs, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for model training.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention cross-validation analysis, which is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. In cross-validation, the available data is split into multiple folds, and the model is trained and tested on different folds to evaluate its performance. But the specific criteria used for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets are not mentioned.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used in this particular context.
