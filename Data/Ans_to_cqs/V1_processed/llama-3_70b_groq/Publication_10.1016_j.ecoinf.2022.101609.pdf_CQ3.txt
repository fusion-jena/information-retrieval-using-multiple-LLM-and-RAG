I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses a proposed deep learning framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the architecture of the framework, hardware specifications, and scalability performance, but it does not delve into data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
