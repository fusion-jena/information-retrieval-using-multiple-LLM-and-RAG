The context does not mention a deep learning model, but rather traditional machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). 

However, to ensure the generalizability of these models, several measures were taken. Firstly, data augmentation was used to extend the existing training data, which enhances the generalization capabilities of the models. 

Additionally, the reference dataset was split into training and testing sets at a 70:30 ratio, and 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions was applied in the model-building phase. This helps to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy and also reflects the resulting distribution of models with minimums, maximums, quartiles, and medians. 

Furthermore, the training dataset was randomly split into 10 folds, with 9 folds used for model training and 1 for testing, and this procedure was repeated until all folds were testing data. This process was repeated using two new random splits. 

Lastly, the optimal segment size was chosen based on the extent of the patches, without losing any elements of the species pattern, and the mean values of the segments were used for classification. This helps to avoid spatial autocorrelation when using k-fold cross-validation in the model-building and/or accuracy assessment phase.
