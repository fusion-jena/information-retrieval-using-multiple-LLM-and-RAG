Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to underwater spectral images and automatic underwater fish species classification, it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the pipeline. There is no mention of audio or video data formats. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common format for tabular data, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the context. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether CSV is used in the pipeline.
