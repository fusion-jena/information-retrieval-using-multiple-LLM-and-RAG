Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the MLP model, including the use of Adam optimizer, learning rate scheduling, and different regularization techniques.

However, it can be inferred that the input to the MLP model consists of learned features extracted from a diffusion model, which might have undergone some preprocessing steps. But the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Batch Normalization in the third layer of the MLP model, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer. But this is not a preprocessing step, rather a technique used during the training process.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
