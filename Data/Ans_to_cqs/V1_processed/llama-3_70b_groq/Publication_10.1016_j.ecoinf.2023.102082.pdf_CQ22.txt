The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention some metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of the CHM (Canopy Height Model) such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), R2, and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of regression models, but they do not provide information about the performance of the deep learning model used to create the CHM. 

Additionally, the context mentions Rao's Q and CV (Coefficient of Variation) values, which are used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the CHM, but they are not directly related to the performance of the deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
