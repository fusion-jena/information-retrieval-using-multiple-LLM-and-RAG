The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the description of the proposed model as a "pixel-based deep learning segmentation architecture" and the mention of a "MU-Net model structure" in Fig. 6, it can be inferred that the model is likely a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a variant of it, commonly used for image segmentation tasks.
