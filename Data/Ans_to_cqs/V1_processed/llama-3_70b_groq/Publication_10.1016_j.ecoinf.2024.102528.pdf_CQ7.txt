Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the application of the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations and the pipeline used for species identification. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation of the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
