The context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that image data is used, as the task involves fish classification by species using a residual neural network (ResNet50V2) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The presence of image preprocessing and data augmentation steps also suggests that image data is involved. No other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are mentioned in the context.
