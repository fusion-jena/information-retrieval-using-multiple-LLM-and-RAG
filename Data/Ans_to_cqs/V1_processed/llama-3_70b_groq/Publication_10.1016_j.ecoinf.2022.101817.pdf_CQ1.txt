Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in the deep learning pipeline involves extracting frames from videos. Specifically, 12,000 frames were extracted from 1500 videos, which were then used to generate five different datasets using repeated random sub-sampling. 

It is not explicitly mentioned how these videos were collected or what type of cameras or sensors were used to capture them. However, based on the context of environmental condition classification and freshwater biodiversity monitoring, it is possible that the videos were collected using underwater cameras or sensors.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for raw data collection in this specific pipeline. However, it is worth noting that the context mentions Imagenet, a large-scale hierarchical image database, which is a public dataset. But it is not clear if this dataset was used for raw data collection in this specific pipeline.

In summary, the raw data collection method utilized in this deep learning pipeline involves extracting frames from videos, but the exact method of video collection is not specified.
