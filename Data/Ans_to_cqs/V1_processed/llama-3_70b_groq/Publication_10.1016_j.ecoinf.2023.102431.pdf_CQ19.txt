I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model. The text discusses Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) and its application in wildlife conservation, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build the model. The context mentions linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression, but it does not mention deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
