I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a forest fire danger system (IFDS) and discusses various datasets used in the system, including FFMC, FWI, and meteorological data, but it does not mention deep learning or any related datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
