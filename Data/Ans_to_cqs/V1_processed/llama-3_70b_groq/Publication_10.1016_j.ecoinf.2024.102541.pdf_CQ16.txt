Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the mathematical formulations of various loss functions, including EIoU and LFocal, and their components, such as IoU, distance, and aspect ratio losses. It also discusses the advantages of these loss functions and their impact on object detection models.

There is no mention of training completion criteria, such as validation loss plateau, convergence, or a specific number of epochs. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.

If you have additional context or information, I may be able to help you better.
