I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the proposal of a novel deep learning method, ESK model, which fuses Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. It discusses the architecture and functionality of the ESK model, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
