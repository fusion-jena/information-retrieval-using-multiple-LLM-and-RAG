The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It only shows the model training process using a resnet18 architecture and saving the model after each epoch. There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
