I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the supervised learning workflow, data collection, and sampling plot creation, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
