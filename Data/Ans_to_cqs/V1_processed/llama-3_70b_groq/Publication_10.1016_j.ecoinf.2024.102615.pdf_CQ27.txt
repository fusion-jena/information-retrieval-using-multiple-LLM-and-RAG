I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the model optimization process, including the tuning of hyperparameters and the architecture of the MLP model. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
