Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, results, and discussions related to the performance of the models. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that may have been performed after model training.

However, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation was performed, as the results of the experiments include values for RMSE, MAE, MRE, and accuracy. Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of bias and precision errors for the sensors. But, beyond these metrics, the context does not provide further information on other postprocessing steps that may have been involved.
