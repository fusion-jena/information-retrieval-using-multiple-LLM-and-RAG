The context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyperparameters of the 'classical' machine-learning algorithms (AB, GB, HB, and LD) were left at scikit-learn default values, except for the learning rate of GB and HB (which was set to 0.15) and the tolerance threshold value for LD (set to 1 Ã— 10^(-10)). For the AN model, the initial learning rate was set to 0.001 and the maximum number of epochs was set to 15, but it does not mention how these values were chosen. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
