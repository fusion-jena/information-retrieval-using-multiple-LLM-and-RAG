I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation, including the introduction of Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings and modifying the architecture of deep learning models like YOLO. It also includes figures showing the original YOLOv8 architecture and a modified mYOLOv8 architecture, as well as a flowchart of the process. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
