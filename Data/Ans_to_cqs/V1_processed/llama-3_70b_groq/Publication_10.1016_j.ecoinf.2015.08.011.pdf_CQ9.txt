I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their application in various fields such as ecology, climate change, and biology. It discusses the selection of parameters for ANNs, such as the number of layers, neurons, and learning rates, and provides references to various studies that have used ANNs in their research. However, it does not provide any information about a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to answer the query.
