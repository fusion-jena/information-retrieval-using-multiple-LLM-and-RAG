Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses the use of deep learning for wildlife population estimation, aerial surveys, and biodiversity monitoring, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
