The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the validation data (10% of the training data) was used for hyperparameter tuning, which implies that the model's performance was evaluated on this validation set during the tuning process. This evaluation would have provided insights into the model's performance during training, allowing for adjustments to the hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
