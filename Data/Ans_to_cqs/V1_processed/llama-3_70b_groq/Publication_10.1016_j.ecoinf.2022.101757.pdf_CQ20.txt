I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the DeeplabV3+ model, the COCO dataset, and the process of semantic segmentation, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
