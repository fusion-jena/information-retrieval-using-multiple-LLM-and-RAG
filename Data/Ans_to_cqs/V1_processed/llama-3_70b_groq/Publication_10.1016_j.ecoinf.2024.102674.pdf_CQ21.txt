Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics, specifically the Shape values, which indicate the degree of extrapolation. This is done by calculating the Mahalanobis distance between the training and projection data using the FLEXSDM R package.

Additionally, the context suggests that downscalings are extrapolated by comparing the training data at the calibration points with the projection data over the study area, resulting in 12 surfaces of the Shape extrapolation metric for both WorldClim and CHELSA, one for each month.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these postprocessing steps are involved in this specific study.

It is worth noting that the context provides a table with PC values and percentages, but it is not clear how these values are related to the postprocessing steps.
