The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset created from satellite images, which is divided into four classes: urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road. This dataset is not a standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather a specific dataset created for the purpose of this research. The dataset is further divided into three subsets: a training set with 22,666 images, a validation set with 7,554 images, and a testing set with 7,554 images.
