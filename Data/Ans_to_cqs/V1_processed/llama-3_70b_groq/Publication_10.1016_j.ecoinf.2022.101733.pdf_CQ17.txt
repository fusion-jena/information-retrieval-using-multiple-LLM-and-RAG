Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, support vector machines (SVM), and other topics unrelated to deep learning regularization methods.

While the context does mention SVM, which is a machine learning algorithm, it does not discuss regularization methods specific to deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.

If you have any further questions or would like to provide additional context, I'd be happy to try and assist you.
