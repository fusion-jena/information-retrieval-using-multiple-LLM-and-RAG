I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions a GitHub repository (https://iiasa.github.io/ibis.iSDM/) where a full list of functions and examples can be found, but it does not specify a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
