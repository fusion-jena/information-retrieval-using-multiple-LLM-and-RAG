Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the importance of fish biomass estimation, the challenges of biomass estimation in turbid environments, and the potential of deep learning techniques to address these challenges. It discusses various deep learning models and architectures, such as Bidirectional LSTM, GloVe embeddings, YOLO, and Convolutional Neural Networks, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question.
