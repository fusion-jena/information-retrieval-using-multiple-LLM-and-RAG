Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the AODEGRU model, its architecture, and its application to water pollution analysis in aquaculture. It does not provide information on regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
