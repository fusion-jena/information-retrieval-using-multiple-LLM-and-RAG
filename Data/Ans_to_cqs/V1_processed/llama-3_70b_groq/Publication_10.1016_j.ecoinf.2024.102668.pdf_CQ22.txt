I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The text discusses the mitigation of device biases in ecoacoustic indices and the applicability of these indices to machine learning and deep learning, but it does not provide specific information about the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
