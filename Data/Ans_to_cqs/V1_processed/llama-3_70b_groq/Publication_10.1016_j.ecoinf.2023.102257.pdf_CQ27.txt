I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of machine learning (ML) models for species-level classification and their impact on tagging efficiency in wildlife monitoring. The context explains the experiment design, data collection, and analysis, but it does not provide information on how the ML model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
