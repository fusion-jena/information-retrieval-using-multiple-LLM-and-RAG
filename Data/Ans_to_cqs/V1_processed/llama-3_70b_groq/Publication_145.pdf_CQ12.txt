The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a U-net. This is mentioned in the context as "a deep learning method called U-net" in the section discussing the ability of the model to identify features in large amounts of data. U-net is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is commonly used for image segmentation tasks.
