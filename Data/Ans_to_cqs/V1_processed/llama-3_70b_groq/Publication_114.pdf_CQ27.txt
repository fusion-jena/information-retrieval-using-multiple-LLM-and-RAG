Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training and testing of the deep learning models, specifically the VGG16 network, and presents the results of the classification. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
