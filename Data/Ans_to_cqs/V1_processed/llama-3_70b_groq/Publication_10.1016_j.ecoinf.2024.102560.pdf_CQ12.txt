I don't know. The provided context does not mention a deep learning model being used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in one of the references (Rahimi, A., Breuste, J., 2021), but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. The context primarily focuses on the description of the problem, data sources, and methodology used for analyzing lake water surface area and salinity variations.
