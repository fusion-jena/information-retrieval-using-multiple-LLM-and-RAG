Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and design of the model, including the use of residual networks, batch normalization, and layer normalization. It also discusses the importance of the training data distribution and paradigm in ecological soundscape analysis. However, it does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
