I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository link. The context appears to be a list of references and author contributions, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
