I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the FFT window size, minimum frequency for detecting cow vocalization, and the performance of machine learning algorithms in detecting ungulate vocalizations, but it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
