I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP), for SOCS modeling, but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used to train the model.
