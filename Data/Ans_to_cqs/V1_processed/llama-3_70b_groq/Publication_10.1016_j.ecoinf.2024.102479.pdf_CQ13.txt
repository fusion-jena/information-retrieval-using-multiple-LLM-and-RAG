The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The table provided (Table 1) lists the tuned parameters for each algorithm, but it does not include deep learning model hyperparameters. The algorithms listed are Random Forest, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Penalized Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and k-Nearest Neighbors. 

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is the only algorithm that can be considered a deep learning model. However, the hyperparameters listed for ANN are HiddenLayer, Neurons_per_layer, and threshold, which are not the typical hyperparameters associated with deep learning models, such as learning rate and optimizer.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
