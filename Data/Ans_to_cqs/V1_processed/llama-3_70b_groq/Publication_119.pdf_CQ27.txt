Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and optimization of the U-Net model and the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, including the architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and accuracy assessment. It does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
