I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the challenges of object detection in UAV thermal images, the use of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and ResNet models, and the importance of customizing deep learning structures for detecting small objects like deer in UAV thermal images. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
