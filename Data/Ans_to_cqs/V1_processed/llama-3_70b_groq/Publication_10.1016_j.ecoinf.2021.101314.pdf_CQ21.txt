Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the method's parameters, thresholds, and requirements for generating redescriptions, as well as the analysis performed using the SIREN interface. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
