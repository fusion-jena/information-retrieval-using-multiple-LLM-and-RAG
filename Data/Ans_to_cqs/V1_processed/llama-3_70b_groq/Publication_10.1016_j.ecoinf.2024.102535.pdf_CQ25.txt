The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The models are evaluated on single and multi-label classification problems, and the number of neurons in the dense layer of the classifier module corresponds to the number of classes in the dataset. The goal is to characterize deep-sea substratum, and the models are trained to predict the class labels of the substratum.
