Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from a monitoring network of 13 sampling points along the Santiago-Guadalajara River (Fig. 1). The data collected includes various water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and concentrations of different chemicals and pollutants (e.g., aluminum, arsenic, barium, etc.).

It is not explicitly stated in the provided context how the data is collected, but it can be inferred that sensors or other automated monitoring systems are likely used to collect the data, given the mention of "online water quality monitoring" in the reference to BoÂ¨enne et al. (2014). Additionally, the fact that the data is collected from a monitoring network suggests that sensors or other automated systems are used to collect the data.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used to collect the raw data. The focus appears to be on collecting data from the monitoring network and using machine learning models to analyze and predict water quality parameters.
