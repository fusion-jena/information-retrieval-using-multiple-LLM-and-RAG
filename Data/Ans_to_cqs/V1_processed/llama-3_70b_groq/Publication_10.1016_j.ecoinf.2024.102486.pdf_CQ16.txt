I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are typically used in machine learning to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, discussing posterior distributions, convergence diagnostics, and kernel density estimation. There is no mention of training or optimization criteria, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
