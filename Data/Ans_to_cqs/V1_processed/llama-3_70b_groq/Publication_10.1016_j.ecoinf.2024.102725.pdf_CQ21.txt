Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are primarily focused on evaluating the performance of the model. The context mentions the calculation of various metrics such as R2, MAE, RMSE, and ERGAS, which are used to assess the accuracy of the prediction results.

Specifically, the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is used to evaluate the average magnitude of the errors between the fused results and observed values. The ERGAS (Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synth√®se) calculates the quality of the fused image as the normalized average error of the fused image bands.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the importance of input features, and confusion matrices are used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Since the context appears to be focused on regression tasks (e.g., predicting continuous values), these postprocessing steps may not be applicable.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training in this context appear to be limited to calculating various metrics such as R2, MAE, RMSE, and ERGAS to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction results.
