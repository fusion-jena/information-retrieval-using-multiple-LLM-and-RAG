The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the creation of biased and unbiased datasets for plant identification studies, and the architecture of a deep neural network. 

However, it can be inferred that the authors have attempted to handle randomness in the dataset creation process. For instance, in the biased dataset, the authors randomly take 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing, attempting to achieve an approximate 70%-30% distribution for each species. Similarly, in the unbiased dataset, the authors use the unique specimen identifier to place images from the same specimen in either the training or testing dataset, attempting to avoid the same specimen bias.

It is not clear from the provided context how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline itself, such as setting a random seed value. This information may be outside the scope of the provided context.
