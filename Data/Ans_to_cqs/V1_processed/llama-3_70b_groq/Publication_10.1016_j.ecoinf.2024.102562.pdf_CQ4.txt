According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

* Flip in horizontal and vertical directions
* Rotations
* Affine transformation
* Multiply
* Linear contrast
* Sharpen
* Emboss

These techniques were used for heavy augmentation when training the ResNet-101 network for 500 epochs.
