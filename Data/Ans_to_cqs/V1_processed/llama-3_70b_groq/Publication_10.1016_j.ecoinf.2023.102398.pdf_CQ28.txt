The context does not explicitly mention the specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the trained model is hosted and run in a cloud-based system, and that the training is done in Google Colab. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
