The context does not mention a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text appears to discuss Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Random Forest (RF) models, but not deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
