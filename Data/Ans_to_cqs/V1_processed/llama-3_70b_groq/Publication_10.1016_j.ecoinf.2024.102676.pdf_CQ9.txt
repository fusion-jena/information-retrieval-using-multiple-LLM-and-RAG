I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context mentions a North American Animal Tracks Database, but it does not provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It also mentions various publications and references, but none of them seem to provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
