I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to environmental niche models (ENMs) and their application to predicting biodiversity changes in fragile ecosystems, particularly wetlands. It discusses the use of big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models to forecast biodiversity changes, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split data for deep learning model training.
