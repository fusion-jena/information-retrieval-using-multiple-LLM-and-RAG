The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models and Google Cloud computing, but it does not specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
