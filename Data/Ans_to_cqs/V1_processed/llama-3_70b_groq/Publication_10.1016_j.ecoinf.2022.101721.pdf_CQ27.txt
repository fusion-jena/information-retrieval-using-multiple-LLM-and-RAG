I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to discuss the use of machine learning for species identification, particularly in the context of bat identification, and mentions the importance of including all observations in statistical modeling. However, it does not provide information on the deployment of a trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
