The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The supervised learning workflow is divided into five steps: (1) data upload and script preparation, (2) training/validation dataset, (3) image segmentation, (4) woody cover classification, and (5) accuracy, export, and land cover count. However, the context only provides details about the first step (data upload and script preparation) and mentions that the workflow adheres to the steps outlined in Sections 2.3.1-2.3.5. 

Section 2.3.5 mentions "accuracy, export, and land cover count," which suggests that some form of metrics calculation is involved. Table 3 provides statistics, including overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy, which are likely calculated as part of the postprocessing steps. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices. 

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved in the postprocessing steps, but the exact steps are not specified.
