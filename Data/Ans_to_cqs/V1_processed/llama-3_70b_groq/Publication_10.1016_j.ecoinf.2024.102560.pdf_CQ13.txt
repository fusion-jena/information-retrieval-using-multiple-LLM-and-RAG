I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be related to environmental studies, soil salinity, drought monitoring, and wavelet transforms, but it does not provide information about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
