The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two metrics: overall accuracy score and the mean value of intersection over union (MeanIoU). The overall accuracy score is computed as a fraction of correctly classified pixels and their total number. The MeanIoU metric is widely used in semantic segmentation because it allows for the handling of class-imbalanced cases, which are common when dealing with pixel-wise classification problems.
