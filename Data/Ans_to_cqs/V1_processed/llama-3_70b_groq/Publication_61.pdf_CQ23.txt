The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does suggest that the authors are aware of the importance of generalizability and the potential issue of model overfitting.

In the section 5.4, the authors discuss the potential improvement to the current work, suggesting that including more examples in the dataset, obtained under different conditions, such as different daylight conditions or different year seasons, could be a better approach to improve the accuracy. This implies that the authors recognize the importance of having a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting being used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken.
