I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and performance of the DeepLabv3+ model, as well as its application to herbarium-related studies, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
