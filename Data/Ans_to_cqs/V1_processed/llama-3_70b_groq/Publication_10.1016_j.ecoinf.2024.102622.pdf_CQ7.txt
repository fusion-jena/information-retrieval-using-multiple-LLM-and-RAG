The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on crop classification, chlorophyll content estimation, and rice canopy coverage using various machine learning models such as random forest, support vector machine, decision tree, and others. 

However, it can be inferred that the data was split into training and validation sets, as the results of the models are evaluated using metrics such as R2 and RMSE on both the training data and validation set (Table 4). The exact criteria or ratio used for splitting the data are not provided in the given context.
