Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to image processing and analysis, but it does not provide information about data bias or preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

The context mentions image acquisition and processing, including de-clouding, mosaicking, and cropping, as well as analyzing raw reflectivity data. It also lists various contributions to a research project, including writing, visualization, validation, and methodology. However, it does not provide any information about addressing data bias or preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
