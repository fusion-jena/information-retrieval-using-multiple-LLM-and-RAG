The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on minimizing biased training of machine learning models with clustered data, specifically in the context of geospatial modeling.

However, it does mention some techniques that can be related to addressing data bias, such as:

* Inverse probability bootstrap sampling to eliminate sample-induced bias in model-based analysis of unequal probability samples (Nahorniak et al., 2015).
* Covariance-weighted bagging to reduce bias during model training by down-weighting over-sampled information.
* Bootstrap aggregation (bagging) applications to address issues of biased model training and validation simultaneously.

It does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques to address data bias. These techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, but they are not discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query based on the provided context.
