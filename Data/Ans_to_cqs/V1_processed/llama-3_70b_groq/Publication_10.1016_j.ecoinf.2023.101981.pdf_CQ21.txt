I don't know.

The provided context does not mention model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to acoustic monitoring and data collection, discussing the deployment of acoustic recorders, data sampling rates, and the number of recordings collected. There is no mention of machine learning or model training, which is typically where postprocessing steps like those mentioned in the query would be relevant. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
