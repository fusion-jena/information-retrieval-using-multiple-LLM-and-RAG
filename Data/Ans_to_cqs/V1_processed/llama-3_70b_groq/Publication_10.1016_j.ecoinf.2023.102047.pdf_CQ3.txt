Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is inferred from the mention of "object proposal" and "bounding boxes" in the context of the Faster R-CNN model. Additionally, the use of the 'LabelImg' software, a graphical image annotation tool, suggests that bounding box annotation is being used to label the datasets.

There is no explicit mention of instance segmentation as a data annotation technique in the provided context. However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "semantic segmentation" in the context of identifying posidonia meadows in underwater images, but this is a different task from instance segmentation.

In summary, based on the provided context, bounding box annotation is the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline, but there is no evidence to suggest the use of instance segmentation.
