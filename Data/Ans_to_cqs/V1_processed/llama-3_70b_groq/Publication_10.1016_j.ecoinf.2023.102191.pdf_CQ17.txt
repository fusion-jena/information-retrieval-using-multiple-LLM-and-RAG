I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The text appears to be discussing a citizen science project that uses a mobile app to collect data on marine species, and it focuses on issues related to data quality, bias, and validation. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning techniques, let alone specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
