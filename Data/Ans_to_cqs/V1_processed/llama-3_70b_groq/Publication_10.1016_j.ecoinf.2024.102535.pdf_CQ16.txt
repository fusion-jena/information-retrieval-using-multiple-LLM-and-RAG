The criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the early stopping procedure, which is controlled by the patience parameter. The patience parameter is set to 10, which means that the training will stop when there are 10 epochs without improvements in the validation loss. This indicates that the training is complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops improving for 10 consecutive epochs.
