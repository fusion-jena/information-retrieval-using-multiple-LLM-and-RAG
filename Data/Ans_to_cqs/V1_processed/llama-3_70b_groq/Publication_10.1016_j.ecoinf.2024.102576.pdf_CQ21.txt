Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the PCF (Phenology-based Crop and Forest) land monitoring system, including the generation of training data, PSI (Phenology-based Satellite Imagery) extraction, and the application of the U-Net model for land-cover classification. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps performed after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
