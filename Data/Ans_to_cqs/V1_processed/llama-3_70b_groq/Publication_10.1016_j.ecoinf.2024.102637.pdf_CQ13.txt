The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The only hyperparameter mentioned is λ, which is used to adjust the balance between the nonlinear factors of the activation function and the identity mapping of Aʹ(x) based on the number of training iterations. It is expressed as λ = e/E, where e represents the current number of rounds of training and E represents the total number of rounds of model training. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query regarding the learning rate and optimizer used in the deep learning model.
