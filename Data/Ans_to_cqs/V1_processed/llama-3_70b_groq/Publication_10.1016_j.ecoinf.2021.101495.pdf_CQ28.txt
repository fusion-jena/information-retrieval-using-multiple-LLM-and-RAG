I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the computing infrastructure used to train the neural networks, which is Nvidia Tesla V100 (16GB), and the implementation of the ResNet50V2 model in TensorFlow. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
