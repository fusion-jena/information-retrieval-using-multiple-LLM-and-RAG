I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the software libraries and versions used, such as Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Optuna, and LightGBM, but does not provide information about the hardware resources utilized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
