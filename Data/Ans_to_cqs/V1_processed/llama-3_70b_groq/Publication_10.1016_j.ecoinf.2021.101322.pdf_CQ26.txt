The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning and a pre-trained network (EfficientNet) that has been trained on a large and diverse dataset (ImageNet). This approach can help alleviate data bias issues by leveraging the knowledge learned from a large dataset and adapting it to the target task.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of expert reading of extra 150 images and another image dataset, which could potentially help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce bias. However, it does not provide specific details on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a labelling approach that involves averaging the estimates of multiple readers to reduce single reader biases. This approach can help smoothen out biases in the labels, but it is not a traditional technique used to address data bias during preprocessing.

In summary, while the context provides some insights into the approaches used to address data bias, it does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
