Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for seagrass coverage estimation and mapping, discussing various models and their performances on different datasets. It also touches on the importance of feature engineering in machine learning and the ability of deep learning approaches to perform feature engineering independently. Additionally, it mentions the issue of data distribution shifts in different locations and a domain adaptation model that addresses this issue. However, it does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
