The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a custom dataset used for training a CNN model for whale image classification, which consists of 700 aerial images with whales and background, annotated with bounding boxes. This dataset is not a standard benchmark dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather a specific dataset created for a particular task.
