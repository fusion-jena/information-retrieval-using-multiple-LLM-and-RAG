I don't know. The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The text discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for processing geospatial data, the collection and distribution of training and validation samples, and the analysis of feature batches using the McNemar's test. However, it does not provide information about the code repository or its availability on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
