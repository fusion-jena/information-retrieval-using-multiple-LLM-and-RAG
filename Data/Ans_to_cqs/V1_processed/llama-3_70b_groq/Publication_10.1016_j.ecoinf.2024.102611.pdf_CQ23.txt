The context does not explicitly mention a deep learning model, but it does discuss a hierarchical classification model that uses a Random Forest (RF) classifier. To ensure the generalizability of this model, the following measures were taken:

1. Consistent ratios of trained, tested, and validated samples across groups were maintained to avoid potential bias during classification.
2. Different samples were present across groups to establish the reliability and generalizability of the model.
3. Both validation and test sets were considered separately to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, leading to generalizability and scalability towards unseen datasets.

It is not explicitly mentioned whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used. However, the use of separate validation and test sets suggests that some form of splitting was employed. Additionally, the context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset, but the presence of different samples across groups implies some level of diversity.

It is important to note that the context does not provide information on the development of a deep learning model, so it is unclear what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model.
