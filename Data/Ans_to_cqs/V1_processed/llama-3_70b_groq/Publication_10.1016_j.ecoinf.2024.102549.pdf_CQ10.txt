I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in environmental studies, specifically in predicting algal blooms and water quality classification. It provides references to various research papers and includes figures illustrating the CNN model architecture, but it does not provide a link to a code repository.
