I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses the methodology and results of the study, including the use of field measurements, ground photographs, and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation. However, it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available.
