I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model, its generalizability, or the measures taken to ensure it. The context appears to be discussing natural water retention measures, land use conversion, and infiltration rates in the context of flood management, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning model or its evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
