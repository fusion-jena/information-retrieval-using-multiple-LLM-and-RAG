I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper in ecological informatics, and it presents various metrics and results for different models and test sets, but it does not provide information about the datasets used. Therefore, I cannot determine the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
