The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are 70% for training and 30% for validation. This is mentioned in section 2.3.1. Data pre-processing, where it is stated that "Each successive model iteration was trained on 70% of the training data and validated against 30% of the training data." Additionally, a separate test dataset was used for final testing/evaluation of the model, which comprised 2735 h of audio from nine independent sites that were different from the training/validation dataset.
