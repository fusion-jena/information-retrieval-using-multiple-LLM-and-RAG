I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various research papers and experiments related to bird species recognition using deep learning, but it does not provide information about the availability of the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
