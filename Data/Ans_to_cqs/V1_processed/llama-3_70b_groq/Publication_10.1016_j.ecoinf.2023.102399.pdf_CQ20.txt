Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology and results of the fish biomass estimation system based on a deep neural network, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
