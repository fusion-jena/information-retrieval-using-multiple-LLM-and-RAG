I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context focuses on the architecture of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), their layers, and techniques for understanding their inner workings, such as analysis of embeddings and dimensionality reduction. It also mentions various models, including BirdNET and SincNet, and their performance on specific datasets. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training.
