Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model is used for land use/land cover classification. This is mentioned in the paper by Kumar and Gorai (2023), which compares the performance of deep convolutional neural networks and deep neural networks for land use/land cover classification in mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data. 

However, it's worth noting that the context also mentions other applications of remote sensing and atmospheric correction algorithms, such as retrieving chlorophyll-a concentrations, detecting suspended particulate matter, and classifying aquatic environments. But the specific purpose of the deep learning model in these applications is not explicitly stated.
