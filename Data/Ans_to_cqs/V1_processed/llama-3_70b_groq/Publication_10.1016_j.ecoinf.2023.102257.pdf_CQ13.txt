I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context focuses on the experiment design, data collection, and results of the study, but it does not provide details about the deep learning model's architecture or hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
