Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of the organ detection model on a different un-annotated dataset, the annotation process, and the results of the model. It does not provide information about the training process or the stopping criteria used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
