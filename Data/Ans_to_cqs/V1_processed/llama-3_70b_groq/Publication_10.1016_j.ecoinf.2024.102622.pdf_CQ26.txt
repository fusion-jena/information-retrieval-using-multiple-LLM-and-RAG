I don't know.

The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and vegetation indices, with references to various studies on hyperspectral imaging, crop classification, and soil-adjusted vegetation indices. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or techniques to address data bias. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
