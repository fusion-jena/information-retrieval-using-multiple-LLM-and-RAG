I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate the model, such as MAE, RMSE, ERGAS, and R2, and provides formulas for calculating these metrics. It also presents the results of the model reconstruction using different models, including SOWCEM, DCT-PLS, and ESTARFM. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of these models are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
