I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model or pipeline. The text appears to be related to a research article about crowdsourcing biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers using a mobile app called Dive Reporter. The context discusses the methodology, data collection, and analysis, but it does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
