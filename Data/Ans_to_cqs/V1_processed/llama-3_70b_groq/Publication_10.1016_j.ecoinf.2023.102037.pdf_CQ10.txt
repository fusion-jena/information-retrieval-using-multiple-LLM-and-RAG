I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. It mentions various research papers and projects related to insect pest monitoring and detection, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. The only GitHub link mentioned is for a project called "Make Sense" by Skalski, but it is not clear if this is related to a deep learning pipeline for insect pest monitoring.
