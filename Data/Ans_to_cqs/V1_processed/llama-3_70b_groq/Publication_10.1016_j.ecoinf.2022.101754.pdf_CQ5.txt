The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and forest biomass estimation using machine learning and LiDAR data. The references cited are related to remote sensing and forestry, but do not mention common deep learning datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
