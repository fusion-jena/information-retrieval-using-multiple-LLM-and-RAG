Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text states, "Since the dataset is not large enough for deep learning to overcome the problem of overfitting, data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset for training and overcoming network overfitting." This suggests that data augmentation is used to increase the size and diversity of the dataset, which can help mitigate data bias. However, it does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.
