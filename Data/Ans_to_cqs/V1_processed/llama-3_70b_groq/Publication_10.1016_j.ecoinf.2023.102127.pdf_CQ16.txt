The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on model-based integration, validation metrics, and model evaluation in the context of species distribution modeling. It discusses the challenges of validating models when integrating multiple datasets and the importance of considering prior knowledge of the biology of a species. 

The context also touches on model evaluation metrics, such as True Skill Statistics (TSS), and thresholding methods for creating binary, categorical, and normalized outputs. However, it does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
