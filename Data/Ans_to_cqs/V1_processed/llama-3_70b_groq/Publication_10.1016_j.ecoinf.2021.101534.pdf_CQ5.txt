The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on a specific application of deep learning for automated information extraction from soundscape recordings, particularly for bird sound classification. The test dataset used in this case study is obtained from soundscape recordings, which are noisier than focal recordings. However, it does not provide information about the specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
