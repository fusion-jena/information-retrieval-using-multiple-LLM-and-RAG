Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the calibration of deep learning models using a single parameter for all classes, post-processing techniques to improve classification accuracy, and the architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

However, it can be inferred that the context assumes a certain level of preprocessing has been performed, as it discusses the training of CNNs on a given database (T0) and the use of a second independent database (T1) for tuning risk thresholds. Typically, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential before training a deep learning model.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide specific details about the preprocessing steps involved in this particular case. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
