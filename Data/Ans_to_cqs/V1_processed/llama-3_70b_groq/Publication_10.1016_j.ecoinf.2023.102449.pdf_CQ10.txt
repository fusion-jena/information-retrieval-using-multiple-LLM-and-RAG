I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only describes the model architecture, including the encoder and decoder, and provides details about the pre-processing block, convolution, and pooling layers. There is no mention of a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link, or any other code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link as an answer to this query.
