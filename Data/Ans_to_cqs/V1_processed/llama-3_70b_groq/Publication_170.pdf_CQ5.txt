The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention ImageNet in the context of a research paper by Krizhevsky et al. (2012) on image classification with deep convolutional neural networks. This suggests that ImageNet might be one of the datasets used, but it is not explicitly stated as part of a deep learning pipeline.

The context also mentions a Colombian llanos camera-trap image dataset and a mountainous ecological monitoring system in Northwest China, but these seem to be specific datasets used for camera-trap image classification and not part of a general deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the only dataset that can be inferred as being used in a deep learning pipeline is ImageNet, but it is not explicitly stated as part of a pipeline. The other datasets mentioned are specific to camera-trap image classification and not part of a general deep learning pipeline.
