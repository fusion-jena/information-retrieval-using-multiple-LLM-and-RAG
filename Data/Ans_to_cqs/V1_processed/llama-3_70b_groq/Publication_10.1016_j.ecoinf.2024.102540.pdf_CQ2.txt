Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The context mentions that the dataset consists of images of sorghum leaves with alates, and the models are trained to detect alates on these images. The images are used at two different input resolutions: 640 × 640 pixels and 1280 × 1280 pixels. There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV being used in the pipeline.
