Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and provides information about the layers, tensor/vector shapes, and supplementary materials. It does not provide information about the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
