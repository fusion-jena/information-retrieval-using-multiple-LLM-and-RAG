According to the provided context, before training a machine learning (ML) model, a preprocessing step involved is data standardization. Specifically, the study adopted Z-score normalization techniques to standardize the water quality (WQ) indicator data. This process optimizes the model error by converting all variables to a uniform scale. The Z-score formula is given as Z = (Xi - X) / σ, where Z is the standardized score, Xi is the ith variable of WQ indicator dataset, X is the mean value of WQ indicator data, and σ is the standard deviation of WQ indicator data. 

However, the context does not explicitly mention other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or other types of normalization. It only mentions data standardization using Z-score normalization. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that other preprocessing steps like scaling or cleaning are involved in this specific study.
