The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics are used to assess the difference between predicted and actual values, indicating the accuracy of the model. Additionally, R-squared (R2) is also mentioned as a metric, but it is not used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this specific study.
