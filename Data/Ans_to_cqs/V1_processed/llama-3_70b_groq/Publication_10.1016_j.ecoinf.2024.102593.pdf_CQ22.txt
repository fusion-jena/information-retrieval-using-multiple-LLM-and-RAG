The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention some metrics used for dimensionality reduction and clustering, such as trustworthiness, silhouette coefficient, and Hopkins statistic. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors compared the performance of different models, including SincNet, BirdNET, and ResNet152-architecture models, but it does not provide specific metrics used to evaluate their performance. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.
