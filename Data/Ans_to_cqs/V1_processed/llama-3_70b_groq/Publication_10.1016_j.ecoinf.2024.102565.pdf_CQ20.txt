I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that MATLAB programming software was used as the primary tool for crafting and assessing the models, but it does not provide information about the underlying hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
