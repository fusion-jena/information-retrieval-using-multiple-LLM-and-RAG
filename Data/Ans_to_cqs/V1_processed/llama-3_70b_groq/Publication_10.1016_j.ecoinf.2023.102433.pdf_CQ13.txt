I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model, hyperparameters, learning rate, or optimizer. The context appears to be discussing a web service API provided by NASA, its methods, and parameters. It explains the functionality of certain methods, such as execute_many and execute_all, and how they handle large volumes of requests. There is no mention of deep learning or any related concepts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
