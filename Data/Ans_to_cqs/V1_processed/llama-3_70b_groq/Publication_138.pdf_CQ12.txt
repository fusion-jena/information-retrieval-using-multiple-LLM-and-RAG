The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be inferred from the mention of convolution layers, inception modules, and pooling layers, which are all characteristic components of CNNs. Additionally, the context mentions the use of LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, which are all well-known CNN architectures. The description of the layers, including the use of ReLU activation functions, LRN, and dropout layers, further supports the conclusion that the model is a CNN.
