Based on the provided context, it appears that aerial surveys using cameras are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions "aerial surveys" and "oblique imagery" as methods for collecting data. Additionally, it references the use of "high-definition oblique camera systems" and "high-resolution aerial cameras" in wildlife surveys.

It does not mention the use of sensors or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. However, it does mention the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques to process and analyze the collected data.

It's worth noting that the context is focused on wildlife conservation and biodiversity monitoring in African savannas, so the methods mentioned may be specific to this domain.
