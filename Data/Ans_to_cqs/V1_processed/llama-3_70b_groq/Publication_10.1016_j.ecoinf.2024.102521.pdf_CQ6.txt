Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the STARdbi system, its features, and its applications in insect classification, but it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of labeling individual insects by experts, which implies that data annotation and preparation are crucial steps in the process. Additionally, the context acknowledges the rapid development pace of general AI-based methods for image processing, which might involve various preprocessing techniques.

To provide a comprehensive answer, I would need more information about the specific deep learning model and the dataset being used. In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, data augmentation, and feature extraction, among others. However, without more context, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
