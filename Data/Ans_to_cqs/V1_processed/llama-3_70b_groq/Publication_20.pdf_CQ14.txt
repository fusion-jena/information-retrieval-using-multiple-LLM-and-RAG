The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of the model, the application of decision rules to improve the model's output, and the comparison of the model's performance with human performance. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
