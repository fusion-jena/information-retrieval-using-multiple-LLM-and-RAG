The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context mentions several custom datasets related to ecological informatics, including:

1. RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard
2. RGB-images of a single tree branch
3. RGB-images of urban streets
4. Synthetic images and natural images of forests
5. RGB-images of a modern apple orchard
6. RGB-images of complex urban scenes

These datasets are likely used for tasks such as salient object detection (SOD), object detection (OD), and segmentation (Seg) in the context of ecological informatics.
