Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The text mentions "image representations extracted from deep neural networks" and "marine images from Australian seas" in the Benthoz15 dataset. Additionally, the paper references ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database, and uses a pre-trained VGGnet, a convolutional neural network, to extract features from images. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
