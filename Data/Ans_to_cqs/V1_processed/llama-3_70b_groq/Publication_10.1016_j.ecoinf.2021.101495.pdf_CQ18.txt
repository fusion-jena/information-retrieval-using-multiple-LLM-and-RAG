Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the computing infrastructure used, training duration, and the effect of data augmentation on model performance, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
