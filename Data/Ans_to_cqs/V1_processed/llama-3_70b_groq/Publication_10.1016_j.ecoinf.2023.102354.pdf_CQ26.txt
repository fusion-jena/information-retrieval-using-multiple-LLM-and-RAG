Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions and drought anticipation in the GAB region. It discusses the importance of groundwater assessment and its implications on sustainability and livelihood. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques or bias handling methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
