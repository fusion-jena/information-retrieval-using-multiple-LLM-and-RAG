Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are related to the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

The context mentions the confusion matrix as a parameter to validate the performance of a machine learning model, which includes essential parameters such as True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), and Sensitivity (TPR). 

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step. It is possible that saliency maps might be used in other applications, but it is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are likely to include metrics calculation and the creation of a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the model.
