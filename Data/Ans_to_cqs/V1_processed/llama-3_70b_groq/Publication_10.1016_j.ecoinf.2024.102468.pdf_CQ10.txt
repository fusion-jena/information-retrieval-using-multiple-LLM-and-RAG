I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and figures related to ecological informatics, machine learning, and signal processing. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not available in the provided context.
