I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecology, biogeography, and conservation biology, discussing topics such as citizen science, species occurrences, and habitat features. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision, which are the typical domains where datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
