Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in LSTM neural networks. It discusses the exploratory phase of random searches for feasible hyperparameter configurations, but it does not delve into handling randomness in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of random searches in the exploratory phase of the TPEBO algorithm, which implies that randomness is involved in the process. Nevertheless, it does not provide specific strategies for handling this randomness.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves techniques such as fixing random seed values, using reproducible random number generators, and employing techniques like dropout and data augmentation to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
