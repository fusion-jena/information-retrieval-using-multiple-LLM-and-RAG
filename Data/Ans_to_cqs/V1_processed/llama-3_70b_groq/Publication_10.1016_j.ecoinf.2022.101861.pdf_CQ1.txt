Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline utilizes acoustic surveys for collecting raw data. This is inferred from the mention of "acoustically surveying cryptic species" in the paper by Lambert and McDonald (2014) and the reference to "soundscape recordings" in the paper by LeBien et al. (2020). Additionally, the context mentions "signal parameters" and "inter-syllable gap" which suggests that the raw data may be in the form of audio recordings.

It is also possible that public datasets are used, as the context references various publications and datasets, such as the "Birds of the World" dataset. However, it is not explicitly stated how these datasets are used in the deep learning pipeline.

There is no mention of sensors or surveys (other than acoustic surveys) being used for collecting raw data. Therefore, it can be concluded that acoustic surveys and possibly public datasets are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
