Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, the experiments conducted, and the concept of Same-Specimen-Picture Bias (SSPB). It does not provide information about the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the evaluation of the model's performance in the experiments, but it does not provide details about the specific metrics used or the postprocessing steps involved. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
