The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that a 60-20-20 train/validate/test regime was used to randomly split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. This suggests that the model performance was monitored and evaluated on the validation set during training, but the specific metrics or strategy used for monitoring are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the hyperparameters were determined using a grid search, which implies that the model performance was evaluated on the validation set for different hyperparameter combinations to select the best-performing model. However, the exact strategy or metrics used for monitoring the model performance during training are not provided in the given context.
