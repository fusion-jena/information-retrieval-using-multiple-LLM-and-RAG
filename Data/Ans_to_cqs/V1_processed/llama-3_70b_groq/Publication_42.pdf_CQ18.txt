Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the performance of the chosen CNN model, its F1-score, and the ranking of different CNN architectures, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.

However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, as these metrics are mentioned in the context. Additionally, the context mentions the use of different optimizers (Adam and SGD) and hyperparameters, which suggests that the model performance was monitored and evaluated during training to select the best-performing architecture.
