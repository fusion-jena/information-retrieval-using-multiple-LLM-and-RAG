Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the CNN model, its training, and the API provided to access the classification tool, but it does not provide details on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
