I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, optimization techniques, or specific algorithms like SGD or Adam. The text appears to discuss valve gaping in shellfish, its relationship with metabolic functions, and the potential for big-data collection to improve predictions in aquaculture. It includes references to laboratory experiments, sensor technology, and clustering analysis, but does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
