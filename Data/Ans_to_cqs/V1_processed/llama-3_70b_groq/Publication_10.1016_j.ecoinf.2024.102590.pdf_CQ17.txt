I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning or regularization methods to prevent overfitting. The context discusses land-use and land-cover analysis, supervised learning, and the use of a Random Forest classifier for woody cover classification. It does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
