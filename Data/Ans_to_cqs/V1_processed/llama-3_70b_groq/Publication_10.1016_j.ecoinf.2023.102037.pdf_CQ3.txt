Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various deep learning-based methods for pest species detection and classification, including object detection, insect vs. non-insect separation, and multi-class insect classification. However, it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

The context does mention that the "Pest24" dataset consists of 25,378 annotated images, but it does not specify how these annotations were performed. Similarly, other studies mentioned in the context, such as Rustia et al. (2021) and Hong et al. (2021), do not provide details on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
