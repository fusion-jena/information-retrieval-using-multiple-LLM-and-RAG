I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects of deep learning models in remote sensing, including model validation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
