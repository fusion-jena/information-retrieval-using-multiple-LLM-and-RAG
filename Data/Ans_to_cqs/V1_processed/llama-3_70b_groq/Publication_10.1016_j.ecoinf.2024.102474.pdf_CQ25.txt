Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. The text mentions that the model is used for "prediction" and "forecasting" in the context of vegetation responses to extreme drought, but it does not specify whether the model is used for classification, segmentation, detection, or regression. 

However, based on the keywords mentioned, such as "NDVI" (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and "vegetation health", it can be inferred that the model might be used for regression or forecasting tasks, such as predicting vegetation health or NDVI values. But without more information, it is impossible to determine the exact purpose of the model.
