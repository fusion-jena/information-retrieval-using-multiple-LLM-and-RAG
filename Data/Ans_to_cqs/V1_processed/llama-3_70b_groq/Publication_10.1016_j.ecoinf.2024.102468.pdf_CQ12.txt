None of the provided context mentions the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. The context does mention the use of HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and compares its performance with other machine learning models like ANN (Artificial Neural Network), SVM (Support Vector Machine), and SCD (Spectrogram Correlation Detector), but it does not mention any deep learning models. Additionally, it references a paper titled "Birdnet: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" but this is not related to the pipeline in question.
