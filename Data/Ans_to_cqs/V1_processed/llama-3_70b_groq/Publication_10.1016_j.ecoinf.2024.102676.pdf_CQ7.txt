I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a study on animal track identification and classification, and it discusses various methods for handling missing data, including deleting cases and mean imputation. It also mentions experiments and model outputs, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
