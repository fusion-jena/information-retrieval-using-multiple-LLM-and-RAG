According to the provided context, the preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is normalization. Specifically, the data was normalized to reduce the impact of large differences in dimension and magnitude values of various parameters. The normalization formula is expressed in Eq. (1), where Yi is the i-th sample value, Ymax is the maximum value, Ymin is the minimum value, and Yi' is the normalized value of the i-th sample.

Additionally, the context also mentions standardization, which is expressed in Eq. (2). However, it is not clear if standardization is used in addition to normalization or if it is an alternative preprocessing step.

There is no mention of scaling or cleaning as preprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these steps are involved in the preprocessing process.
