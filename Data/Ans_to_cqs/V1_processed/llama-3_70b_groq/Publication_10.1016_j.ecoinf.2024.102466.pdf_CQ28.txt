I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be a research paper on ecological informatics, discussing the performance of various deep learning models for bird recognition. It provides information on the models used, their performance, and references to other research papers, but it does not mention the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
