The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the MaxEnt model's output analysis, specifically the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables to the model. It discusses the percentage contribution and permutation importance of various variables, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
