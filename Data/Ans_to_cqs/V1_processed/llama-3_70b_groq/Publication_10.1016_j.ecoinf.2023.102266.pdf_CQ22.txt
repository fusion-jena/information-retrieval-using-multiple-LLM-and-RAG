I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any metrics used to evaluate its performance, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The context appears to discuss a Monte Carlo-based classification model for simulating forest fires, and it mentions limitations of the model, its application to a real wildfire, and the use of certain parameters (θ and ρ) to simulate climatic conditions. However, it does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model.
