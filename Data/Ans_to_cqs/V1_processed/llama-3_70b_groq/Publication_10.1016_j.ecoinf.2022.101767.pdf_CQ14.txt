I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the methodology of searching for YouTube videos using specific keywords, extracting videos with more than 100 views, and excluding certain variables to avoid multicollinearity problems. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
