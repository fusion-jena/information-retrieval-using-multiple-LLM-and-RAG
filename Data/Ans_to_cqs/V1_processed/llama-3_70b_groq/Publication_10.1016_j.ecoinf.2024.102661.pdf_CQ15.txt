The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The focus of the context is on the TPEBO algorithm and its application to hyperparameter optimization in LSTM neural networks. 

The context explains the TPEBO algorithm's approach to hyperparameter optimization, including its exploratory phase, progressive narrowing of focus, and approximation of the global optimum. It also discusses the integration of the input dataset, hyperparameter search range, optimization objective function, and algorithm into the TPEBO-LSTM model. However, it does not mention specific optimization techniques like SGD or Adam.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to the query about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
