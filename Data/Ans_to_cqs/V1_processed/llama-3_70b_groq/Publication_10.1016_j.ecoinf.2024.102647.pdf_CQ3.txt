I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to soil salinity distribution mapping, groundwater dynamics, and statistical models, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These techniques are typically used in computer vision tasks, which are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given information.
