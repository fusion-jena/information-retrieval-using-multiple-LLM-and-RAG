The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include modifications in brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue, along with random horizontal and vertical flips, and random rotations up to thirty degrees. Additionally, Gaussian noise is incorporated to improve the robustness of the model in different conditions.
