Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The text mentions convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their applications in image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and other perception tasks. Additionally, the context mentions "single input images" and "extract predictive texture features from single input images," which further suggests that image data is the primary format used in the deep learning pipeline.

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be inferred that these formats are not used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text.

In summary, the answer to the query is that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data.
