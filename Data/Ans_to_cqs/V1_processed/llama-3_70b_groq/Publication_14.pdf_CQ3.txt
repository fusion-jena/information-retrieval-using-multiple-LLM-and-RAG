I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research paper or project involving machine learning, ecology, and conservation, but it does not provide detailed information about the data annotation process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
