The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the input data is in the form of images. This is because the context mentions "input patch sizes of 256 Ã— 256 pixels" and "image" is mentioned in the description of the DeepLabV3+ architecture. Additionally, the context is related to remote sensing, which often involves image data. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data format used is image data, but the specific format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) is not specified.
