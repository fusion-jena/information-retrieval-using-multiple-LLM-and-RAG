I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and mentions various modeling packages and techniques, but it does not provide information about data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
