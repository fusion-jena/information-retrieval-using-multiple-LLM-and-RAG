The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that hyperparameters are determined from the data using methods like maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches. It does not specify whether grid search, random search, or any other method is used for hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to this query.
