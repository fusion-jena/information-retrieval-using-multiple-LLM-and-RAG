The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text mentions the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, but it does not specify the dataset used in the experiments. It only mentions that the experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation. Therefore, I don't know the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline.
