I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various deep learning models and techniques for bird species classification, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository or a link to access the data. The references cited in the context are mostly academic papers and do not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
