The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of the provided papers is classification, specifically bird species classification. The models are used to classify audio recordings of birds into different species. This is evident from the keywords mentioned in the abstract, such as "bird species classification" and "avian diversity". Additionally, the text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for soundscape classification, which is related to the classification of bird species. The model is also used for ecoacoustic data analysis, which involves the analysis of audio recordings of the environment to understand the biodiversity of a region.
