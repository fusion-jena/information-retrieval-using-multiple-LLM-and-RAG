The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for both training and testing datasets. These metrics are used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context, which are typically used for classification problems. Instead, the focus is on regression analysis, where RMSE and MAE are more suitable metrics. Additionally, R-squared (R2) values are also reported, which indicate the goodness of fit of the model.
