I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It discusses the comparison of different object detection models, such as YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and their variants, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
