Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the names of the models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, CNN, and 3DUNetGSFormer, but does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
