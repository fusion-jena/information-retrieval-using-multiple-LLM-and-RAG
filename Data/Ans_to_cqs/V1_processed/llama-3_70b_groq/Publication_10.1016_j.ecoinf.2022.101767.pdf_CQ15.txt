I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, optimization techniques, or any specific algorithms like SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to a study on YouTube videos about wild birds, discussing factors that influence the number of views, and referencing various sources on ecology and statistics. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
