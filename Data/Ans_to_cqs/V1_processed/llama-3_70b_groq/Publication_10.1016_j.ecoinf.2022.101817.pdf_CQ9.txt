I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various topics such as the VGG16 CNN architecture, ImageNet dataset, and different research papers on image classification, object detection, and underwater image processing. However, it does not provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF).
