I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, being used in the pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the optimization of parameters for a model used to detect burned and unburned pixels in a landscape, but it does not provide information about the specific type of model being used. The terms "LTR" and "MS" are mentioned, but they do not seem to refer to a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
