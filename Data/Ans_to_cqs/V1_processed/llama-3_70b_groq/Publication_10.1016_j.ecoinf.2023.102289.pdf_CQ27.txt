Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the functionality and architecture of LaDeco, a landscape decomposition tool, and its components, such as the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, MXNet, and GluonCV. It does not provide information on the deployment process of the trained model.

However, it can be inferred that LaDeco uses MXNet as the central computational module, which provides a comprehensive suite of neural network models and functionalities for AI development. Additionally, GluonCV is used to develop LaDeco, which offers a set of 25 segmentation models. But, the context does not provide details on how the trained model is deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
