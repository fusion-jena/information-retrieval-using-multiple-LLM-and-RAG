Based on the provided context, it seems that data normalization is not a necessary step in the preprocessing stage. In fact, it is explicitly stated that "the data normalization stage is unnecessary." 

However, the context does not provide any information about other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning. It only discusses the clustering of freshness data using six body parts parameters and evaluating the clustering results. 

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. I can only say that data normalization is not necessary, but I don't know about other preprocessing steps.
