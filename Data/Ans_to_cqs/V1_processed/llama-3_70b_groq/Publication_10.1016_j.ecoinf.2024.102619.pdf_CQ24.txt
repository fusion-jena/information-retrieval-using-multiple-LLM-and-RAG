Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the CNN architecture, hyperparameters, and training process, but it does not discuss randomness or methods to control it.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of the Adam learning rate optimizer, which can help mitigate some effects of randomness in the training process. The Adam optimizer adaptively adjusts the learning rate during training, which can help stabilize the optimization process and reduce the impact of random fluctuations.

Beyond this, the context does not provide further information on strategies to handle randomness. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this query based on the given context.
