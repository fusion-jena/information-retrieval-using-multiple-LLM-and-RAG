Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning, particularly SVM, in behavioral science and its advantages in pattern recognition. It discusses the selection of distance metrics, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning, but does not delve into data bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
