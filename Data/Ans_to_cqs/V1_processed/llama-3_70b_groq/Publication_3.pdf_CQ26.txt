I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the advantages of using CNNs, and the results of a classification task using TensorFlow. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
