The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some information about the predictors used in the species assemblage model. These predictors include WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude). 

It can be inferred that these predictors might be obtained from public datasets or existing sources, but the exact method of collection is not specified. There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for data collection. Therefore, it is unclear what methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
