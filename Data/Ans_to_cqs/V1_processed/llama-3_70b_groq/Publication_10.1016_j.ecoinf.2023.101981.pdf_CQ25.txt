The purpose of the deep learning model is detection, specifically cattle detection. The context mentions the development of supervised machine learning algorithms for ungulate detection, and the use of convolutional neural networks or deep learning for automated cattle detection. Additionally, the study aims to decrease the error rate of algorithms developed using Kaleidoscope, which is a software for detecting ungulates. The model is trained to detect cow vocalizations, and the recall rate of the model is evaluated in the context.
