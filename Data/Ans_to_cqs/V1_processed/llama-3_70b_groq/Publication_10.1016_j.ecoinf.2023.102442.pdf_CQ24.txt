I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or setting a random seed value. The context appears to be related to research papers on topics such as Amazonian freshwater ecosystems, artisanal and small-scale mining, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on deep learning pipeline strategies or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
