Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses audio data formats. The BirdNET-Analyzer model is mentioned, which is a deep learning model used for avian diversity monitoring. The context also mentions "parsing birdsong with deep audio embeddings" and "feature embeddings from the BirdNET algorithm", which suggests that the model is processing audio data. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio.
