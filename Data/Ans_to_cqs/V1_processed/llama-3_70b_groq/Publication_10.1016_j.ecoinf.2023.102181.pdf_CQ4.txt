I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models for predicting soil classes and handling clustered data, with discussions on bagging, bootstrap sampling, and covariance-weighted bagging. There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
