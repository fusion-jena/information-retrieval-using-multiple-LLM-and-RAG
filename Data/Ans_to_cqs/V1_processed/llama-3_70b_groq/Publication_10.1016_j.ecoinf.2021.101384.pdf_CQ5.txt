The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to fisheries and oceanography, discussing datasets and methods for analyzing fishing patterns and vessel data. It mentions GFW (Global Fishing Watch) data, OBIS data, and vessel data aggregated at 0.01 resolutions, but does not reference any deep learning datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
