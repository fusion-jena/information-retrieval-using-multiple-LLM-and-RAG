Based on the provided context, the hyperparameter mentioned is the learning rate (Î·(t)), which decreases with time t. However, there is no mention of the optimizer used in the deep learning model. The context appears to be describing a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network, which is a type of unsupervised neural network. The learning rate is used to update the weights of the neurons in the network, but the optimizer is not specified.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention any other hyperparameters commonly used in deep learning models, such as batch size, number of hidden layers, or regularization techniques. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a comprehensive list of hyperparameters used in the model.
