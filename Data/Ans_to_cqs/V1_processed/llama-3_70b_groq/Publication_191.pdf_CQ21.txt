Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, parameter settings, and visualization of filter responses in the convolutional layers.

However, it can be inferred that the authors computed the top-1 classification accuracy as described in Section 4.3, but the details of this section are not provided in the given context. Additionally, the authors visualized the response of selected filter units using deconvolution results, which can be considered as a form of feature importance or saliency map.

Other postprocessing steps like metrics calculation and confusion matrix are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given information what specific postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
