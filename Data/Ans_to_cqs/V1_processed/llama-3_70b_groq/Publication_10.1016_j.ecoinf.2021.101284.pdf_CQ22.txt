I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses standardization, data processing, and analysis, but it does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model. The reference to Castillo (2020) mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of COVID-19-affected patients, but it does not specify the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
