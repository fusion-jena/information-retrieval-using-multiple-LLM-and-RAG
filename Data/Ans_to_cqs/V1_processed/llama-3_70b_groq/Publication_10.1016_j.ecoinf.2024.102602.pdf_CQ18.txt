The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the early stop approach. This approach is used to halt the training process of a model prematurely if performance on a validation dataset fails to improve beyond a predefined threshold. This helps to prevent overfitting and conserve computational resources. The patience value for the early stop approach is set to 16, which means that the training process will stop if the model's performance on the validation dataset does not improve for 16 iterations.
