The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions the use of the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2017) for training the model, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the Adam optimizer or other model hyperparameters are tuned. 

It is possible that the hyperparameters were tuned using a method such as grid search or random search, but this is not specified in the provided context. Additionally, the context mentions the use of cross-validation for model evaluation, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
