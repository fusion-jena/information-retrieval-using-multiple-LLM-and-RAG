According to the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is a lab-based image acquisition protocol. This protocol involves collecting images of chironomid specimens from 5 sampling sites within the South Morava river basin, Serbia. The images are taken from a ventral point of view, with fully controlled position of the larvae. This controlled environment allows for minimizing feature variability and enables the collection of high-quality images that can be used as inputs for the CNN model. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in this specific study.
