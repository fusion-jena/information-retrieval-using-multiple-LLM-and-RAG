The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model is regularized during the validation process, but it does not specify the type of regularization used.

Although the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it does mention k-fold cross-validation as a resampling technique to avoid overfitting. This implies that the authors are aware of the overfitting problem and are taking steps to mitigate it, but the specific regularization methods used are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
