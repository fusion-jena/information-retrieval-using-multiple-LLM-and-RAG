Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the fine-tuning process, inference, and the iterative process of enhancing the model's performance. It does not provide information on how the data was initially split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
