The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, based on the information presented, we can infer that some performance metrics are calculated, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score, as shown in Tables I and II. 

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of classification accuracies for validation and testing data, as presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. However, it does not provide information about other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices. 

Therefore, we can conclude that the context only provides information about the calculation of certain performance metrics, but it does not mention other postprocessing steps.
