Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the following steps are involved:

1. Conversion of the output to the BBCH scale through a dictionary: This step is mentioned in the context of the second method, where the output is converted to the BBCH scale using a dictionary.

2. Rounding function: In the second method, it is necessary to apply the rounding function on the output before converting it to the BBCH scale.

3. Forcing negative values to zero and values exceeding the upper bound to 91: This correction is made to ensure that the network outputs are consistent with the keys of the dictionary.

4. Metrics calculation: The context mentions the use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the reference metric, and 10-fold Cross Validation is performed to have a reliable estimate of the MSE on the test set.

No mention is made of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these steps are involved in the postprocessing.
