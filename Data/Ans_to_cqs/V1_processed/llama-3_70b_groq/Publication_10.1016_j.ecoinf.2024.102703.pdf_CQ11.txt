I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The text appears to be a research article discussing the spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes and identifying eutrophication indicators in Southwest China. It provides information about the study area, sampling sites, and methods used to analyze the data, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
