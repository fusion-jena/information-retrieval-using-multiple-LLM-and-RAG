The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are F1-score and the geometric mean of true positives and negatives (G-mean). These metrics are mentioned in Table 3, which presents the best results of each method. The table includes columns for CE (cross-entropy loss), FL (focal loss), F1 (F1-score), and G-mean. The F1-score is a measure of the model's accuracy on a specific task, and the geometric mean of true positives and negatives provides a balanced measure of the model's performance on both positive and negative classes.
