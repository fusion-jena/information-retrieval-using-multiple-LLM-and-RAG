I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the methodology of the proposed model, including the use of kernel density estimation (KDE) to determine the decision threshold, and the evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of the model. It also compares the performance of the proposed model with other models, including AE and ESK. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
