Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, model training, and evaluation of the CNN model for image classification tasks. It discusses the use of different datasets, such as GH, LH, and LL, and the evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and classification error, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
