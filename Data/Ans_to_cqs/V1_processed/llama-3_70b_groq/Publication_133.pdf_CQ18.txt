The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of validation data. The validation data are set aside while training and their annotations by the model are monitored. This helps to limit the training duration, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. As shown in Figure 2, the validation loss stabilizes after 30 epochs, indicating that further training might lead to overfitting. This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training by tracking the validation loss, and the training is stopped when the validation loss stabilizes.
