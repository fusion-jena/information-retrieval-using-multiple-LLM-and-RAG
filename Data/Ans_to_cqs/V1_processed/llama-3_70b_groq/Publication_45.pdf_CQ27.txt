Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the introduction to deep neural networks, their application in ecological prediction, and the basics of deep learning. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
