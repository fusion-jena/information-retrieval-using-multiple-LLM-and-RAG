The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the data formats used are likely to be raster data formats, such as GeoTIFF, for the NDVI, vegetation type, and DEM data, which are typically used for geospatial data. The meteorological data, including temperature, precipitation, and radiation, might be in a CSV or NetCDF format. The road data and GDP data might be in a vector data format, such as Shapefile or GeoJSON. The population data could be in a CSV or Excel format. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
