The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset. This dataset is used to predict the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH). There is no mention of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets in the provided context. These datasets are commonly used in computer vision tasks, but the current study focuses on marine data prediction using deep learning and machine learning models.
