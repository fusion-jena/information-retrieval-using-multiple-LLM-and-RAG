I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. It only mentions that the Neural Networks were built from scratch using TensorFlow (tf) and Keras, and that TensorFlow is an open-source framework developed by Google. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
