I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored. The text discusses the importance of oil palm yield prediction, the application of machine learning and deep learning models, and the analysis of 17 models using a robust agronomy dataset. However, it does not provide information about the data repository where the dataset is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the data is available on Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
