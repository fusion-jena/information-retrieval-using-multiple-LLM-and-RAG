Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different feature representations (Spectral Indices, MFCC, and Auto Encoder) using various evaluation metrics (bcubed precision, recall, F-score, and purity) and visualizing the results using t-SNE plots. It also provides some information about the dataset, data pre-processing, and the structure of an auto-encoder. However, it does not provide details about the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
