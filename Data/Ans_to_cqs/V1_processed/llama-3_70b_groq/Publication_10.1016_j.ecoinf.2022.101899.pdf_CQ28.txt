I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the research papers and their findings on using deep learning for wildfire event predictions in Australia, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
