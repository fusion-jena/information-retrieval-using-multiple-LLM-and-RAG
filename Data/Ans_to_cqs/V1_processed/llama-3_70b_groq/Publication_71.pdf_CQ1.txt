Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, a deep learning model for image segmentation, and discusses some general challenges and considerations when applying deep learning methods to new applications.

However, it can be inferred that the context assumes the availability of a dataset, which is used to train the DeepLabV3+ model. The dataset is likely a collection of images, possibly with corresponding labels or annotations for training the model. The context also mentions the importance of having a vast amount of training data and ensuring that the training data has similar characteristics as the testing data.

It is common in deep learning pipelines to utilize various sources of data, such as public datasets, surveys, sensors, or other data collection methods, depending on the specific application and problem domain. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in this particular context.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, and more information would be needed to determine the specific data collection methods used in this deep learning pipeline.
