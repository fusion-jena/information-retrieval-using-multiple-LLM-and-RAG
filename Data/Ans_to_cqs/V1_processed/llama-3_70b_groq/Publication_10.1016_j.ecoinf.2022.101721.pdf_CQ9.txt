I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be discussing statistical analysis and species identification using machine learning, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository where the pipeline is stored. The context mentions that the outcome of the analysis is stored as a .csv file, but it does not specify where this file is stored or if it is publicly available. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
