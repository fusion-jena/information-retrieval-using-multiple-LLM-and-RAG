I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or using hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. The text appears to be discussing valve gaping in shellfish, its relationship with environmental variables, and its potential applications in aquaculture and ecosystem management. There is no mention of deep learning models or hardware resources, so I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
