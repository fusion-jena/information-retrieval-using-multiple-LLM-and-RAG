I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses various topics, including land cover/land use classification, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, and random forest (RF) models. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in a specific deep learning model.
