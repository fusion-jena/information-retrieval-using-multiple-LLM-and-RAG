The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification and segmentation. Specifically, it is used for LiDAR and UAV points cloud classification for DTM creation and flood risk mapping, as well as individual tree segmentation and tree species classification in subtropical broadleaf forests. Additionally, it is used for ground cover classification based on the Digital Orthophoto Map (DOM).
