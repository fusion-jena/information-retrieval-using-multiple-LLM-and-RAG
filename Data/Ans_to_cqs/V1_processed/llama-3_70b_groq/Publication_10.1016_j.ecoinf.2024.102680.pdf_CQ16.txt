Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the UODN model, including the effects of the CSMB and LKSP modules on object detection. It also provides some hyperparameter settings, such as batch size, but does not discuss the training stopping criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
