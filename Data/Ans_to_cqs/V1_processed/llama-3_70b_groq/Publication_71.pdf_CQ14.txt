Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context only provides the values of the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ (Table 1) and describes the sequential training approach used for the Vasiliko dataset. It does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization method used, such as grid search, random search, or any other method.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
