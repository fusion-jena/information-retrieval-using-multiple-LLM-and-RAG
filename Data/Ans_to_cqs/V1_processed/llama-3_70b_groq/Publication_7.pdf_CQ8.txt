I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of deep learning techniques to a coral reef classification problem, but it does not include any information about the code used to implement the pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
