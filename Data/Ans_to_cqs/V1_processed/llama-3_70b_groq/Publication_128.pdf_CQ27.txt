Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the model training process, including the parameters and functions used, and the computational resources and environment used for training. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
