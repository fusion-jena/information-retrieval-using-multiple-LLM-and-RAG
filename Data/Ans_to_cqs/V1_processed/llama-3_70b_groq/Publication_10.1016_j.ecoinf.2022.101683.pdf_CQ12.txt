I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context appears to be related to the evaluation of a model's performance on different datasets, with metrics such as AUC, Omission, TPR, Kappa, and TSS being reported. However, it does not provide information about the architecture or type of model used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) based on the provided context.
