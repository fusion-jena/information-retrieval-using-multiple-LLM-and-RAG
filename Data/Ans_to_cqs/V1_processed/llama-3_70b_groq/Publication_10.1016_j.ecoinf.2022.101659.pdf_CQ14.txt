The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the analysis of gaping data, the use of big-data for improving predictions on productivity, and the potential for future research, but it does not provide information on the optimization of model hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
