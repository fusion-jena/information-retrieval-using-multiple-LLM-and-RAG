I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the execution environment, software, and hardware used in the study, as well as the results of calculations with different parameters for ResNet50 and VGG19 + ResNet50. It also mentions data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels as part of the optimal simulation result, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
