Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land cover classification and ecosystem services, but it does not provide information on the data collection methods. It discusses the potential applications of the tools developed, such as locating urban heat-prone areas and determining the health benefits of ecosystems, but it does not elaborate on how the raw data is collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
