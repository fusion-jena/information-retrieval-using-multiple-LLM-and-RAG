The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does show a "Data preprocessing process" in Fig. 2, but it does not provide details about the specific steps involved in the process.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular model. However, in general, common preprocessing steps in deep learning include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. Normalization involves scaling the input features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming the input features to a common scale, such as standardization or min-max scaling. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming the most relevant features to improve the model's performance.

In the absence of specific information about the preprocessing steps involved in this model, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
