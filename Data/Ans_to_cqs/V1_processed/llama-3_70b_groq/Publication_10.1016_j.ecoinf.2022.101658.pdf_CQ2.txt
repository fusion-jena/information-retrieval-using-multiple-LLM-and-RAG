Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images, specifically photographs. This is evident from the mention of "nadir photographs" in the title of the study and the use of "photos" in the context of manual classification of fuel types for training and testing the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Additionally, the study involves semantic segmentation, which is a computer vision task that typically involves processing image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
