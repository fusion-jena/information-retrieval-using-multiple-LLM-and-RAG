I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The text discusses the architecture of different deep learning models, such as Unet, Pspnet, and DeeplabV3+, and their applications in geographical and ecological challenges, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
