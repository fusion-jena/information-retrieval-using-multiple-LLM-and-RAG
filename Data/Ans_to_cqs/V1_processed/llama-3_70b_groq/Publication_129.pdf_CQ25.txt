The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection. Specifically, it is designed to detect agricultural insect pests in images. The model uses a Faster R-CNN approach, which is a type of object detection architecture that combines a Region Proposal Network (RPN) with a Fast R-CNN detector. The RPN proposes object locations, and the Fast R-CNN detector refines these proposals to produce the final detections. The model outputs a bounding box around each detected object, along with a class label indicating the type of pest.
