The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The table of training parameters for DeepLabV3+ lists various hyperparameters, such as the learning policy, base learning rate, and training number of steps, but it does not specify a stopping criterion like validation loss plateau. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
