I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing ecological informatics and data processing, but it does not provide specific information about a deep learning model or any methods used to ensure its generalizability. The text mentions field survey data, data processing, and a classification method, but it does not mention diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
