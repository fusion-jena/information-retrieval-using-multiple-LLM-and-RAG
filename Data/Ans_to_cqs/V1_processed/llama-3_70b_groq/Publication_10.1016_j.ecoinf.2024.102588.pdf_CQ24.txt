The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of random forests and XGBoost models, which involve randomness in their construction.

In the context of random forests, it is mentioned that the hyper-parameters of the RF were set to the number of estimators at 100 and the random state at 0. This suggests that the random state was fixed to ensure reproducibility of the results.

No other information is provided about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer based on the given context.
