Based on the provided context, it appears that the study utilizes airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and PlanetScope imagery for collecting raw data. The ALS data is used to obtain high-resolution topographic information, while the PlanetScope imagery provides spectral information related to vegetation and water content. The study combines these two data sources to predict volumetric water content (VWC) in post-mining landscapes.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that other studies or methods may utilize these approaches for data collection.

It is worth noting that the context does not explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline, but it does discuss the integration of ALS and PlanetScope data for soil moisture assessment, which may be a part of a larger pipeline.
