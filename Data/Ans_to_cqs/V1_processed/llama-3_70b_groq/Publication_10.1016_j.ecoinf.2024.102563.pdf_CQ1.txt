Based on the provided context, it appears that the data collection methods utilized in this study include field investigations and the use of existing datasets. Specifically, a 10-m spatial resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was used as auxiliary data, and a field investigation was conducted to obtain more precise soil information. Additionally, a scale served as a supplementary source for establishing a soil sample database. 

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for data collection. However, it can be inferred that the study relies on existing datasets, such as the ones mentioned in the references, and field-collected data.
