The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context discusses various deep learning models such as CNN, ResNet-50, VGG16, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, NASNetMobile, Xception, EfficientNetB0, ResNeXt50, and InceptionResNetV2, but it does not mention the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
