Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to topic modeling and social network analysis, and it discusses the perplexity calculation, topic intensity, and keyword ranking. However, it does not provide information about the training process or the criteria for determining its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
