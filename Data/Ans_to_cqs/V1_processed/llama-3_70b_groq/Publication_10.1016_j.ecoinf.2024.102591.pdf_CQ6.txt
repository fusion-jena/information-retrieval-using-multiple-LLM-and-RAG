The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the input data used is atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2 A scenes. This suggests that some level of preprocessing has been done to the data, but the specific steps are not detailed.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a large predefined training dataset and a data-mining approach, which may imply that some data cleaning or preprocessing has been done to prepare the dataset for training. However, the exact steps involved are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
