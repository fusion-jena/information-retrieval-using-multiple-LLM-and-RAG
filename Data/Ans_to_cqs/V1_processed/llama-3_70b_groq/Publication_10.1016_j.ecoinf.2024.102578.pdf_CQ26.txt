Based on the provided context, it appears that image augmentation techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the keras image_data_generator function is used for image augmentation, which includes random assignment of the following techniques:

* Rotation (0-40 degrees)
* Width and height shift range (20%)
* Shear range (0-0.2 radians)
* Zoom range (0-0.2 scalar)
* Horizontal flip
* Fill mode with the nearest pixel

These techniques help to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting, which can help to mitigate data bias. However, it does not appear that stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are explicitly mentioned as techniques used to address data bias. Additionally, there is no mention of diverse data collection as a technique used to address data bias.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the preprocessing pipeline, so it's possible that other techniques may be used to address data bias that are not mentioned.
