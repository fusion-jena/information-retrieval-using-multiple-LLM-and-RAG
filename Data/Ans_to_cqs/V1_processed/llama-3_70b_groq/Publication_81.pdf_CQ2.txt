The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is numerical data. According to the context, the DNA barcode sequences are first aligned to obtain sequences of the same length, and then converted into numerical data using one-hot encoding. This numerical data is then used as input to the Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) model to learn the deep features and obtain the outgroup scores of each fish.
