The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. In fact, the text states that "No additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms as the goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible in order to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming." This suggests that minimal to no data augmentation techniques were used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied, as they are not mentioned in the provided context.
