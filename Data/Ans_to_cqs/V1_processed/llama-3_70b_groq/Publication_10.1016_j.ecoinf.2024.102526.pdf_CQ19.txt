I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to image capture, annotation, and metadata, with a focus on scientific research and data curation. It does not provide information about the development or implementation of deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
