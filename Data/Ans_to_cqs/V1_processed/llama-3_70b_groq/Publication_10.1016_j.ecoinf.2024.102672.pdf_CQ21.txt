The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the design of the classification and regression models, the hyperparameters used, and the results of the training and testing. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

The only related information is the mention of the "loss curves during the training" and the calculation of metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Percentile (P50) for the regression model. Additionally, the context provides a confusion matrix for the classification model in Table 1, but it does not mention any further postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
