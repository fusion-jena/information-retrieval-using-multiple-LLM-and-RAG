According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS). These metrics are used to measure the accuracy of the performance of the deep learning models, including the CNN model and CNN with an autoencoder, as well as conventional machine learning models with ANN, SVM, RF, and XGBoost for estimating TDI, BMI, and FAI values.
