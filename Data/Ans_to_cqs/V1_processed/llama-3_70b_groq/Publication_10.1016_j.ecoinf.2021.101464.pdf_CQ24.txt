The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to random forest models and their application in ecology and environmental science. It discusses the optimization results of a random forest model, variable importance, and the performance of the model in explaining variance.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is outside the scope of the provided context. The context does not provide any information about deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
