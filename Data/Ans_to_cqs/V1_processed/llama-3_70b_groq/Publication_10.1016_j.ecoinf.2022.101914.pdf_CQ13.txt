I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The text discusses ensemble models, random forests (RF), generalized linear models (GLM), and MaxEnt, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
