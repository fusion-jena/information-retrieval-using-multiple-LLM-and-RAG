Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the mention of VGG (a type of CNN architecture) in the context, specifically in the sentence: "We created a two-stage pipeline by having the VGG model from the empty vs. animal experiment classify whether the image contained an animal..." Additionally, the context also mentions other CNN architectures such as AlexNet, NiN, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, which further supports the conclusion that the pipeline uses a CNN.
