I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing species distribution models, sampling bias, and environmental covariates, with references to various studies and publications. There is no mention of a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository.
