I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to research papers in the fields of hydrology, ecology, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. The only dataset mentioned is the NDVI dataset (NDVI3g) generated from AVHRR sensors by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS), but this is not a typical dataset used in deep learning pipelines.
