I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the architecture and components of various convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, as well as the layers and operations used in these networks. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used to prepare and label data for training and testing machine learning models.
