The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The text mentions the use of covariance-weighted bagging, which is an ensemble learning method, but it does not mention any deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
