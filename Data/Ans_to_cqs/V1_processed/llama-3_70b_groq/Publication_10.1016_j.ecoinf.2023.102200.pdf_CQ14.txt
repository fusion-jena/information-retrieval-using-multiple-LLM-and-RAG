I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a study on mangrove tree segmentation using LiDAR data and an improved KNN algorithm, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. The tables and figures provided show the results of the study, including the performance metrics of the improved KNN algorithm, but they do not mention the optimization method used for the hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
