The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the input data is in a numerical format, as it consists of two nodes, one for DOY (Day of Year) and the other for GDD (Growing Degree Days). The output is also numerical, as it predicts the BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie) value, which is a numerical scale.

There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the pipeline. It is possible that the data is stored in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the answer is that the data format is likely numerical, but the exact format (e.g., CSV) is unknown.
