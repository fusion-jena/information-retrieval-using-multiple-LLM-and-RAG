I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the PBP method is implemented in Python through the pypbp package, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
