Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on presenting the results of the proposed classification network, comparing its performance with other models (ResNet50, ViT, and CA-Hybrid), and discussing the benefits of incorporating CAM (Class Activation Mapping) to improve classification accuracy. There is no mention of the training process or the strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
