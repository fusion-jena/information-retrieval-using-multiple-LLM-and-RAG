I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the authorship contributions, the effectiveness of a processing pipeline, and the use of ecological acoustic indices (EAIs) in assessing biodiversity. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
