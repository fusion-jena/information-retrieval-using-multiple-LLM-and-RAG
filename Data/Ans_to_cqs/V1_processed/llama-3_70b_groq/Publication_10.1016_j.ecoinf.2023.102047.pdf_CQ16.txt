Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation, dataset composition, and evaluation metrics (such as mAP and IoU) for object detection models. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, convergence, or a specific number of epochs.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
