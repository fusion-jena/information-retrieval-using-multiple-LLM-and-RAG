I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context discusses machine learning algorithms used for habitat suitability prediction, species distribution modeling, and microbiome-based classification problems, but it only mentions traditional machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). There is no mention of deep learning models.
