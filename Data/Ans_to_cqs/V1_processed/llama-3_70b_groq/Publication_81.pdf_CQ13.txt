I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc. The context focuses on the architecture of the model, the use of Elastic Net to solve overfitting problems, and the comparison of different models, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training.
