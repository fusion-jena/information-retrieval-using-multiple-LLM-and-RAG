Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that a dropout value of 50% has been used in the first three layers to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. This suggests that dropout regularization was used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there is no mention of other measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being used.
