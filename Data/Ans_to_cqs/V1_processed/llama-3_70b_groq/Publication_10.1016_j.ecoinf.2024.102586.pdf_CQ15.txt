I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to a study on invasive alien species, discussing data sources, study areas, and methods for separating native and alien species. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
