The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the performance of different CNN architectures on the validation set, including the F1-score, training accuracy, and validation F1-score. However, it does not specify the stopping criterion for training, such as a validation loss plateau, a certain number of epochs, or a target performance metric.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular study.
