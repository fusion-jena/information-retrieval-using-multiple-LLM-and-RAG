I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameters. The text appears to be discussing forest biomass density, forest types, and their spatial distribution in the Qinba Mountains. It cites various research papers on topics such as estimating forest biomass using LiDAR data, phytocoenological characteristics of Abies fargesii forests, and carbon stocks and fluxes in subalpine Rocky Mountain forests. There is no mention of model optimization or hyperparameters, so I cannot provide an answer to the query.
