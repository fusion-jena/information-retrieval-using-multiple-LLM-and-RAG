The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the fine-tuning of the model using the Adam optimizer, the number of epochs, and the episodic tasks, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
