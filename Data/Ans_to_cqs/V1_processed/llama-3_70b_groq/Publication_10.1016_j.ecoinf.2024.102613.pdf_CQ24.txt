I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the importance of field data in smart farming, the use of various analysis techniques, and the need for advanced data management systems to handle the volume, velocity, and variety of generated data. It also references various studies and papers on smart farming and data-driven approaches, but does not provide information on specific strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
