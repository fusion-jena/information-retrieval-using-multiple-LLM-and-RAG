I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques, attention mechanisms, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and plant identification. It discusses the importance of data augmentation, the use of attention mechanisms to improve model performance, and the implementation of different pooling operations in the CNN-based model. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
