Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning methods for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water. It discusses various studies that have used different models and techniques for this purpose, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
