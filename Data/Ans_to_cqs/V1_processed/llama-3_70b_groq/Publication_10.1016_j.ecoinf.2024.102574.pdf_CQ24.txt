I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecology, discussing topics such as forest management, carbon sequestration, tree canopy height, and biomass estimation using various remote sensing and machine learning techniques. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context, so I cannot provide an answer to the query.
