The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the overall process of deep learning, data augmentation, and the challenges of working with weakly labeled audio recordings. 

However, it can be inferred that the annotation technique used is likely to be weak labeling, as the metadata only provides information on which species was recorded, but not the exact location of the bird signals in the recording. The context also mentions the development of a simple detector based on signal strength to extract segments containing vocalizations from the recordings. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that the annotation technique used is likely to be weak labeling, but the exact technique is not specified in the provided context.
