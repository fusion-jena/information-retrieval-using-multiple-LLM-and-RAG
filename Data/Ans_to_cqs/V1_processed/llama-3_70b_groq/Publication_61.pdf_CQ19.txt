The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Adam optimizer, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these components. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was used.
