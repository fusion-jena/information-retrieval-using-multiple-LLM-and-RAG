The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the ResNet-50 model, is for image classification. The model is used to classify insect image backgrounds into two classes. The ResNet-50 model extracts features from the input images and generates a feature vector of size 1000, which is then used to train an SVM classifier for classification. The model is pre-trained with the ImageNet database and fine-tuned for the specific task of classifying insect image backgrounds.
