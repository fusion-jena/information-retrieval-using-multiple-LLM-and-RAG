Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of an XGBoost model and the SHAP method for interpretation, as well as the selection of the LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework based on a comparative analysis of different models. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
