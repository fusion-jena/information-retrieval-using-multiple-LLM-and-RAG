The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer. The context discusses the performance of different machine learning models (MLMs) including CART, Random Forest (RF), and others, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters. 

However, it is mentioned that the number of trees in the Random Forest model was set to 500 as an additional parameter to reduce the resulting model's bias. No other hyperparameters are mentioned in the context.
