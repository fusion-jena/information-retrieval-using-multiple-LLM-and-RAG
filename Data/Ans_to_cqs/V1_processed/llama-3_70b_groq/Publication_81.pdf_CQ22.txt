According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. These metrics are mentioned in Table 4, which presents the evaluation metrics on SK and ESK models. The table shows the accuracy, recall, and F1-Score for each dataset (Sciaenidae, Barbinae, and Mugilidae) using the SK and ESK models. Additionally, the text mentions that the accuracy, recall, and F1-Score improved for all datasets when using the ESK model compared to the AE model.
