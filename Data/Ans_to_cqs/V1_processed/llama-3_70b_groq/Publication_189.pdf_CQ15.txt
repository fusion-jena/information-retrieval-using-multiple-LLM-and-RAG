Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context provides information about the Mask R-CNN model, its losses, and the system configuration, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used for training the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. It is possible that the optimization technique used is SGD, Adam, or another algorithm, but it is not mentioned in the given text.
