The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned in the "Data availability" section that "The link to the data is shared in the manuscript". This suggests that the data repository is not one of the commonly known repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but rather a link is provided within the manuscript itself. Unfortunately, the manuscript is not provided, so the exact location of the data repository is unknown.
