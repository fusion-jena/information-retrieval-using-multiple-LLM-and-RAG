I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to redescription mining, a method for discovering patterns in data, and its application to biogeographic analyses. It discusses the output of redescription mining, filtering of redescriptions, and parameter settings for the method, but does not mention deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
