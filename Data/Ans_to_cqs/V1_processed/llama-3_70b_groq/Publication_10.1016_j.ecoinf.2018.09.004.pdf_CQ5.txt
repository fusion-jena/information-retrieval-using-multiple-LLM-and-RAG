The provided context does not mention specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears to be focused on a specific ecological informatics study related to seagrass presence and distribution in the Mediterranean Sea. The dataset used in this study is not explicitly named, but it is described as a large and diverse dataset maintained by international organizations such as Copernicus, EMODnet, and UNEP. The dataset contains environmental drivers, ecosystem components, and human influence factors, which are used to train and test machine learning algorithms for 5-class classification.
