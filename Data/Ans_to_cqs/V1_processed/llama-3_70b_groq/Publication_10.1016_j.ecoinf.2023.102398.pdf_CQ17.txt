The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the DL model used in this work is tuned with optimized hyperparameters for which overfitting and underfitting situations are prevented from occurring. It also mentions that the effort to over-train the model has been avoided and graded MSE convergence has been adopted to fine-tune the model. 

Although it does not specify the exact regularization methods used, it implies that some methods are employed to prevent overfitting. Unfortunately, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific regularization methods used, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
