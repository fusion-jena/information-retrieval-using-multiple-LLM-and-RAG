I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to a study on Sika Deer vocalizations, Red Deer, and ungulate vocalization detection using machine learning algorithms, as well as references to various studies and publications. However, there is no mention of a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
