The frameworks used to build the deep learning models are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the information about the implementations used, we can infer that Hugging Face's transformers library is used for the ViT and ResNet models, and Keras is used for the Inception-V3 model. The optimizers used, such as AdamW and Adam, are also commonly used in these frameworks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the frameworks used are likely a combination of Hugging Face's transformers library and Keras, but the exact frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are not explicitly mentioned.
