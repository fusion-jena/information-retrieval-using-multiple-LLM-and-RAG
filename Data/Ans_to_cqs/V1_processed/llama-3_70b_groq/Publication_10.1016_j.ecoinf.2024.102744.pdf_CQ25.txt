The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is multi-fold. 

Firstly, the classification network is designed for image classification, specifically for bee image classification. The network is trained to predict the class of the original image.

Secondly, the object detection network, YOLOv5, is trained to detect two classes: pollen-bearing and non-pollen-bearing bees. This is an object detection task, where the model is expected to locate and classify objects within the image.

In summary, the deep learning models in this context are used for both image classification and object detection tasks.
