The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the architecture of the CNN model, hyperparameter settings, and data augmentation techniques used to improve the accuracy of the model. 

However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to improve the accuracy of the model. Data augmentation can be seen as a technique to address data bias by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. In this context, the authors have used vertical and horizontal flip as a data augmentation technique.

Other techniques to address data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are not mentioned in the provided context.
