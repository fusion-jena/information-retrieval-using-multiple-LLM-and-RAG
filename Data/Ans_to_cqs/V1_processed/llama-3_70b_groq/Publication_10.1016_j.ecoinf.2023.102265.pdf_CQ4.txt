The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the use of ResNet-50 for feature extraction and its advantages over softmax. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
