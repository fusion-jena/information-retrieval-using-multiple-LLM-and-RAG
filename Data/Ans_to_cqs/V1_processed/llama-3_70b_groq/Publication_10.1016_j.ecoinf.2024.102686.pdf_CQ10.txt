I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be related to a research paper or study, and it provides information about the authors, funding, data availability, study area, and various geographic and environmental conditions. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
