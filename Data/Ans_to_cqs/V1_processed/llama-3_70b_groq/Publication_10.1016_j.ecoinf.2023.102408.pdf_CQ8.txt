I don't know. The provided context does not mention a code repository or provide any information about where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the use of machine learning algorithms (SVM, RF, and ANN) for estimating Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) in agroforestry systems, but it does not provide any information about the code or its availability.
