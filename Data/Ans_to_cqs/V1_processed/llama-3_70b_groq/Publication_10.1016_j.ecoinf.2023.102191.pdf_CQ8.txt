I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text appears to be an excerpt from a research article discussing a citizen science project that uses a mobile app to collect biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
