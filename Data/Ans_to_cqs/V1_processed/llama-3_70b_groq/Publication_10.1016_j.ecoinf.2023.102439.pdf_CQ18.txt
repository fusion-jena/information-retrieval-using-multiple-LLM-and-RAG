The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using several statistical metrics, including the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation between the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the number of neurons in the hidden layer was incrementally increased to determine the optimal configuration that yields the best results. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored and evaluated during the training process to identify the optimal configuration. However, the specific strategy or approach used to monitor the model's performance during training is not explicitly stated.
