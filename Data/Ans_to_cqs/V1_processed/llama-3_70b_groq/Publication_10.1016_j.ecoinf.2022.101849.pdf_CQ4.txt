I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly in the context of regression with structurally incomplete target labels. It discusses various settings for weakly labeled data, including random and non-random reduction of target labels, and compares the performance of different approaches to handling incomplete data. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines.
