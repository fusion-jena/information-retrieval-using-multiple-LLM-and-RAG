According to the provided context, the data was split into training (80%) and test (20%) groups. The images within each species were randomly shuffled and then split along the 80:20 ratio to maintain their proportional representations in the training and test groups. There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data was split into two sets: training and test, with an 80:20 ratio.
