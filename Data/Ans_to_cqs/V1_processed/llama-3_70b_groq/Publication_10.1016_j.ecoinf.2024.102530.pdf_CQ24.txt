I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, random seed values, or strategies to handle randomness. The context appears to be related to ecological modeling, specifically pollination models, and discusses the use of different models and resolutions to assess food resources and nesting positions for pollinators. It does not provide any information about deep learning or randomness in machine learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
