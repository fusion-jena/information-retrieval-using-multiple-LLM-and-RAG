I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context discusses model complexity, feature selection, and model explainability, but it does not provide information on how to deploy a trained model. The references cited are related to machine learning methods, but they do not provide details on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
