The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text discusses various deep learning models and techniques, including LSTM, CNN, and gradient-based sensitivity analysis, but it does not specify the frameworks used to build these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
