I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, data curation, and experiments conducted, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps taken after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
