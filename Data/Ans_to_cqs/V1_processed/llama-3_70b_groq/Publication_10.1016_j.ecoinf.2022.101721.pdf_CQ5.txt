I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to species identification and population size estimation using machine learning, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
