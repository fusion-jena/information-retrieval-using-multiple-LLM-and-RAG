Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context primarily focuses on the classification performance of different methods using single CNN-based models and provides references to various research papers on bird sound recognition using deep learning techniques. It does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
