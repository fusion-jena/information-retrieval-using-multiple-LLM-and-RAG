I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a NASA web service API and its methods for retrieving data, handling large volumes of requests, and providing services for farmers and decision makers. There is no mention of machine learning models or their training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
