Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only mentions that a Microsoft Sponsorship supported Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org, but it does not provide further details on the deployment process. Therefore, I don't know the specific process followed for model deployment.
