I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text appears to be discussing ecological informatics, species distribution models, and machine learning models, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The references cited are academic papers and do not point to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
