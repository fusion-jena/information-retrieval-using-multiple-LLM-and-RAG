Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of the MegaDetector model's performance in detecting animals in images and its limitations. It discusses the model's architecture, training data, and potential factors affecting its performance, but it does not delve into the preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in training the MegaDetector model or other deep learning models in general, based on the provided context.
