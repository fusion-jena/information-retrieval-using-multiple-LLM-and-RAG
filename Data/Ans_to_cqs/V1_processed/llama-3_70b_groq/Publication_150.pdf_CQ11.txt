I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a scientific paper discussing various deep learning models, their architectures, and their performance on a specific task. It includes references to other papers and datasets, such as ImageNet, but does not provide a link to a data repository for the pipeline itself.
