I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the mini-batch size, GPU memory limitations, and the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for image classification. It also discusses the challenges of using deep learning and the importance of reviewing published studies and refining settings through trial and error. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
