The provided context does not specifically discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline or mention random seed values. The context primarily focuses on random forests, a type of ensemble learning method, and its applications in species distribution modeling and genetic association studies.

However, it does mention that in the random forests classifier, the same random number generator is used for all modeling (Kuhn, 2008; R Core Team, 2023). This suggests that the random forests algorithm employs a consistent randomization approach to ensure reproducibility of results.

Beyond this, the context does not provide information on strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline or random seed values. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
