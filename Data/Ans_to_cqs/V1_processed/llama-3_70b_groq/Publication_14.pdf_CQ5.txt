The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used is related to camera trap images and ecological scenes, as the text mentions "screening camera trap images" and "ecological scenes". Additionally, the text mentions that the author collected images for each class and trained a fine-tuned neural network, but the specific dataset name is not provided. It is not MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, as these datasets are commonly used for general image classification tasks and are not specific to ecological scenes or camera trap images.
