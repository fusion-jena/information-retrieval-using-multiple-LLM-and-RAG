I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that "A link to a depository with architecture details is given at the end of references." However, the references provided do not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
