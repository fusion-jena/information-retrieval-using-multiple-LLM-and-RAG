I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and architecture used for the segmentation of herbarium specimens, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
