I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the performance of different object detection models, such as Cascade RCNN, FCOS, and Faster CNN, on a bird detection task, and discusses the number of epochs and training times required for each model to reach its maximum mAP score. It does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
