The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that "data augmentation techniques such as superimposing noise samples should also be considered as bioacoustics applications typically have abundant noise features." This suggests that one possible data augmentation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is superimposing noise samples. 

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive list of data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is unclear whether other techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling are used or not.
