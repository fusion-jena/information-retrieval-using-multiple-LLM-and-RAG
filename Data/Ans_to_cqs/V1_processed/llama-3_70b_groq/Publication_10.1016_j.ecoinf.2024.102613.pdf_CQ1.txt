Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that sensors and IoT devices are used to collect raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text states, "The data are collected from various sources, such as sensors, electronic resources (e.g., text, video, image), and public resources..." This suggests that sensors are one of the methods utilized for collecting raw data. Additionally, the mention of IoT devices in the context of smart farming implies that they are also used for data collection.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether surveys or public datasets are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not know if these methods are utilized or not.

In summary, sensors and IoT devices are used for collecting raw data, but it is unclear if surveys or public datasets are also used.
