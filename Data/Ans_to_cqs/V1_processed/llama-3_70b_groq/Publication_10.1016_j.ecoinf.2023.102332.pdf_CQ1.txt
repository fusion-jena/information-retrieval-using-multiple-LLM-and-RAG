The context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the raw data is collected from Wikiloc posts, which are crowdsourced text descriptions of outdoor experiences shared by hikers. The text descriptions are then translated into English using DeepL, and natural language processing (NLP) methods are applied to extract and analyze the data. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data.
