Based on the provided context, it appears that the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include:

1. **Splitting the dataset**: The dataset was split into a training set (70% of songs in each folder), a validation set (10% of songs in each folder), and a testing set (20% of songs in each folder). This splitting helps to reduce variability between tests and ensures that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

However, there is no explicit mention of:

* **Diverse dataset**: While the dataset contains different dialect classes and years, it is not explicitly stated that the dataset is diverse in terms of other factors that could affect the model's generalizability.
* **Cross-validation**: There is no mention of cross-validation being used to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.
* **Stratified splitting**: Although the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets, it is not explicitly stated that the splitting was done in a stratified manner to maintain the same class balance in each set.

Overall, while some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the context does not provide a comprehensive picture of all the measures taken.
