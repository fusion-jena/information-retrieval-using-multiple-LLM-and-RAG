Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to image capture, metadata, and documentation for an imaging project, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning model training or preprocessing.

However, based on general knowledge, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model may include:

* Normalization: scaling numerical values to a common range, often between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to a common scale, such as standardization or feature scaling, to improve model performance.
* Cleaning: handling missing values, outliers, or noisy data to ensure the quality of the training data.
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations, such as rotation, flipping, or cropping, to the images.
* Data transformation: converting data into a suitable format for the model, such as resizing images or encoding categorical variables.

Please note that these preprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, and the specific steps may vary depending on the project requirements and the type of deep learning model being used.
