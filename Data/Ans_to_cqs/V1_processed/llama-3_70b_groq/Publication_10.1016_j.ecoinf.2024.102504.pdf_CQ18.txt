Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be a list of references related to air pollution, environmental science, and health risks, but it does not provide information about a specific model or its training process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
