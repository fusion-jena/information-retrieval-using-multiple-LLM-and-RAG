The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it provides information about the number of files and their total duration in hours for the train, validation, and test sets. 

It can be inferred that the data was split into train, validation, and test sets, but the specific criteria or methodology used for this split is not mentioned. It is common to split data randomly or based on certain characteristics, such as time or location, to ensure that the train, validation, and test sets are representative of the overall data and to prevent overfitting. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this case.
