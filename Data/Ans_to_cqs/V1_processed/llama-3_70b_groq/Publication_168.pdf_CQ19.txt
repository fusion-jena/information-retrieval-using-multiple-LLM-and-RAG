Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context discusses the application of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to hyperspectral image classification tasks, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
