The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. The context discusses the creation of ensemble models for climate scenario projections, evaluation metrics such as AUC and TSS, and the use of bioclimatic layers and cutouts for species distribution modeling. However, it does not mention the specific purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
