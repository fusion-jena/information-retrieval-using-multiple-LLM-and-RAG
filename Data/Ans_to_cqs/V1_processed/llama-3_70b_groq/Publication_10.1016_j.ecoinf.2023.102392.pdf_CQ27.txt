I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses UAV data processing, land use/land cover classification accuracy, and forest types accuracy using XGBoost, as well as references to other studies on deep learning models. However, it does not provide information on how a trained deep learning model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
