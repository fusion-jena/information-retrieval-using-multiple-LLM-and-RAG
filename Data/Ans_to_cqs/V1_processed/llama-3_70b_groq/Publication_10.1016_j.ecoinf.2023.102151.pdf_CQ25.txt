Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to soil science, environmental concerns, and visualization systems, but it does not provide specific information about a deep learning model.

However, one of the references mentions "machine-learning techniques for classification purposes in digital soil mapping" (Geoderma 265, 62â€“77), which suggests that machine learning is being used for classification tasks in soil mapping. But this is not specifically about a deep learning model.

Without more information, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model.
