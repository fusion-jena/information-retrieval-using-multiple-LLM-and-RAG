I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are terms typically used in machine learning. The context appears to be discussing a function that applies color blind friendly ramp palettes to images, and it does not provide any information about training or criteria for determining when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
