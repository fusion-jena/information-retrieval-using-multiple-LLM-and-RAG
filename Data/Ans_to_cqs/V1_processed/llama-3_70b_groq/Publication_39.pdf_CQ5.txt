According to the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are COCO 2017 and Kinetics-400. The Mask R-CNN model is pretrained on the COCO 2017 train dataset, and the ResNets are pretrained on the Kinetics-400 dataset. Additionally, the authors also use a custom dataset called AnnotationsActions, which is split into train, validation, and test sets for action recognition experiments.
