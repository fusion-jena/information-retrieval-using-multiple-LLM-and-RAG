The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is trained to classify fish events, and the output of the model is a prediction of the event class. The model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with four fully connected layers, and the output of the last layer is used to predict the event class. The model is trained using a loss function, either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss, to update the model parameters and perform the training. The goal of the model is to predict the correct event class from the input features extracted from the diffusion model.
