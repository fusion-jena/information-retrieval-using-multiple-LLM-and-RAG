Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in biodiversity monitoring and the importance of automated approaches to processing and analyzing wildlife data streams. It does not delve into the technical details of the deep learning pipeline, including regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
