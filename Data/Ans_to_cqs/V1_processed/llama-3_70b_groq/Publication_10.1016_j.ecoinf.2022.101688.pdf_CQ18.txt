Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the pre-processing hyper-parameters, dataset configurations, and the comparison of average F1 scores across different network architectures. It also mentions that model training and testing were done on Microsoft Azure using a specific virtual machine, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
