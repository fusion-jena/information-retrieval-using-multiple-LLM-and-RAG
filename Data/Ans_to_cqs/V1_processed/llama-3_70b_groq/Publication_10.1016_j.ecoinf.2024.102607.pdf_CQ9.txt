I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which is a cloud-computing platform for geospatial analysis, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository where the pipeline is stored. The GEE is a platform that offers an extensive repository of Earth observation data, but it is not a data repository in the sense of Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
