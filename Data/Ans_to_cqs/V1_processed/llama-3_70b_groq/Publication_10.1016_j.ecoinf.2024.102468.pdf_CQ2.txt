The context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "blue whale vocalizations" and "bioacoustics," it can be inferred that the data format used is likely audio. The context also mentions "feature vectors" and "Gaussian parameters," which are commonly used in audio signal processing. Therefore, it is likely that the data format used is audio, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
