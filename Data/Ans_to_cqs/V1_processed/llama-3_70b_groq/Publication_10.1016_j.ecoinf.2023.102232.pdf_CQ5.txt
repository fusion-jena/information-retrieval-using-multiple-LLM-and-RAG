I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing a hybrid MCMC algorithm and a genetic algorithm for parameter estimation, but it does not mention deep learning or any specific datasets associated with it. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
