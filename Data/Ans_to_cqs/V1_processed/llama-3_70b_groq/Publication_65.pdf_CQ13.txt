Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only mentions that the methods were trained with the same optimizer and learning rates, but it does not provide the actual values or names of these hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
