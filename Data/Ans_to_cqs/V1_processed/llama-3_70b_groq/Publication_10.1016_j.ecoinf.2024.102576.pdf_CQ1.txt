The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that satellite imagery is used as the primary source of data, as mentioned in the context: "If satellite imagery accumulates owing to continuous satellite observations, the PSI can also be continuously generated, and classification can be continued using the model."

It is likely that the satellite imagery is used as the raw data for the deep learning pipeline, but the context does not provide further information on how this data is collected or processed. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for data collection.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
