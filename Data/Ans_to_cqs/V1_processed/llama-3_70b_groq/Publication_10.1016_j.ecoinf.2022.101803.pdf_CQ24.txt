The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on ensemble methods, including random forests, bagging, and boosting, and their application to improve out-of-sample generalization performance.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of ensuring that models in an ensemble are sufficiently uncorrelated to reduce the variance term in the expected out-of-sample prediction error. This can be achieved through techniques such as random feature selection, as employed in random forests.

In the context of deep learning, setting a random seed value is a common strategy to ensure reproducibility of results and handle randomness. This is not explicitly discussed in the provided context, but it is a well-known technique in the field of machine learning and deep learning.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly address strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does touch on the importance of ensuring model diversity in ensemble methods, which can be related to handling randomness.
