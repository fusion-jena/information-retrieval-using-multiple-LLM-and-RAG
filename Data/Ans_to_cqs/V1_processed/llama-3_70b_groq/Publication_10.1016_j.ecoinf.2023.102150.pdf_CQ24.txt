Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecological research, camera trap systems, and image classification. It discusses the use of R and Python programming languages, various deep learning architectures, and optimization methods, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
