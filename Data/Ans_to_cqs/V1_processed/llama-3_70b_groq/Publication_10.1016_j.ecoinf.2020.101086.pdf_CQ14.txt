I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the parameterization of the correction methods, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. It mentions that the knowledge from the literature and experts was used to parameterize the correction methods, but it does not specify the optimization technique used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
