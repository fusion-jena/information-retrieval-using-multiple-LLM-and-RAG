The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the context, where the authors propose a new model based on CNN, called SeedNet, for single seed classification and retrieval. The architecture of SeedNet is described in detail, consisting of six learnable layers, five of which are convolutional, and the last is fully-connected.
