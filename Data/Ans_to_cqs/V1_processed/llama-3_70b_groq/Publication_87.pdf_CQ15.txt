Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the PyTorch library, model architecture, and training process, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
