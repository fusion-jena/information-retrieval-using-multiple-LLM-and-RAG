I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any specific pipeline that uses a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological carbon sink risk assessment, geographic information systems, and multi-criteria decision analysis, but it does not provide information about a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in a pipeline.
