I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of references and citations related to ecological informatics, unmanned aircraft systems, and bioacoustic monitoring. There is no mention of a specific deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The references provided are mostly academic papers and reports, with a few links to websites and software tools, but none of them seem to be related to a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a code repository link as requested.
