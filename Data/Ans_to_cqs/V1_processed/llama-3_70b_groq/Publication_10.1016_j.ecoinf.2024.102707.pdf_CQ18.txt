Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context only reports the model's performance on the training, validation, and testing data, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during the training process.

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using the F1 score, which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. The context reports the F1 scores achieved by the model on different datasets, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
