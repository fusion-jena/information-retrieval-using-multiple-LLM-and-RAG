The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of various pre-trained networks, such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, in image classification tasks. It discusses the use of shortcut connections, bottleneck architecture, global average pooling, and skip connections in these networks, but does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
