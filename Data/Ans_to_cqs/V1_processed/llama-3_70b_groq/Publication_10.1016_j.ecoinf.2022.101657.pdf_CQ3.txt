Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include instance segmentation and bounding box annotation. This is evident from the mention of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation (Zhu et al., 2017) being used for optimizing instance segmentation of animal species in video clips. Additionally, the context mentions the use of bounding boxes, as indicated by the mention of the mean average precision (mAP) metric, which takes into account the intersection and union of ground truth bounding boxes and predicted bounding boxes.

Furthermore, the context suggests that the network outputs a belief score (b âˆˆ [0, 1]) for species identification, rather than a binary value, which implies that the annotation technique may involve assigning confidence scores to the annotated data.

However, it is important to note that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is possible that other techniques, such as image classification or object detection, may also be employed, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
