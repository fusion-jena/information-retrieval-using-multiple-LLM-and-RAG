The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions the use of 5-fold cross-validation for training and validating the SVM model, but it does not specify the stopping criterion for the training process. 

It is common in machine learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or maximum number of epochs to determine when training is complete. However, this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used in this case.
