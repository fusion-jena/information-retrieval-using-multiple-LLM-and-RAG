Based on the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through ground photographs taken by smartphones. The photographs are nadir photographs, which means they are taken directly above the ground. The photographs are collected at different field sites, including Pelican Mountain, Calling Lake, and Conklin, in the province of Alberta, Canada. The photographs are then used to train and test a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm to estimate percent ground cover and surface biomass loadings in forest ecosystems. Additionally, field measurements are also collected at the field sites, which include manual classification of fuel types and estimation of overstory composition and fuel loads. However, it is not clear if these field measurements are used as part of the raw data for the deep learning pipeline or if they are used for validation or other purposes.
