The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the post-processing phase, discussing the use of a risk threshold to tune the classification model and improve its accuracy. It also mentions the use of two independent datasets, T0 and T1, for model training and threshold tuning, respectively.

There is no mention of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the provided context which techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing.

In general, these techniques are commonly used to address data bias, but without explicit mention in the context, it is unclear which specific techniques are employed in this particular deep learning pipeline.
