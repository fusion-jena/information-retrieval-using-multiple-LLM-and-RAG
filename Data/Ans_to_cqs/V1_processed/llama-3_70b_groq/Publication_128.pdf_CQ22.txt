According to the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is the mean average (MA) top-1 accuracy. This metric measures the distance between predicting labels and labeled classes. The average accuracy is calculated by averaging the outcomes of multiple samples fed into the test model, where the prediction labels are determined by the highest score. The formula for calculating the average accuracy is provided in the context, which is:

Average = (1/n) * âˆ‘[L(F(xi) = yi)] 

where L(.) is a logic function to verify if the argmax index equals the instance label, and F(.) is a function to find the highest score of the classify output.

There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mean average top-1 accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study.
