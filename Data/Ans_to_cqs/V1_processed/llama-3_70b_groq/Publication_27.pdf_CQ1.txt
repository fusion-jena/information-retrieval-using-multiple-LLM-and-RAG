Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of characters, symbols, and numbers, which do not provide any meaningful information about data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not provide any relevant information about surveys, sensors, public datasets, or any other methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
