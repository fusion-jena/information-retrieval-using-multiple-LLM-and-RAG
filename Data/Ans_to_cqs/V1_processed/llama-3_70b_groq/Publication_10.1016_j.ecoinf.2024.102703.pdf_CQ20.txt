I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model was built using MATLAB R2014b, but it does not provide information about the underlying hardware used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
