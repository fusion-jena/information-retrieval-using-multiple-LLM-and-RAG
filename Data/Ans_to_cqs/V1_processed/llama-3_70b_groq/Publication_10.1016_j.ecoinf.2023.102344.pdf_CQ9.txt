I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture and performance of various deep learning models, including BivalveNet, and compares their accuracy in identifying the geographical origin of bivalve shells. However, it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
