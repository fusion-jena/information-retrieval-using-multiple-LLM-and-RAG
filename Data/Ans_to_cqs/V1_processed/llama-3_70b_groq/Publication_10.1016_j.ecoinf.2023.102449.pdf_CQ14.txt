The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the learning rate was "tweaked to an optimal configuration of Î· = 0.0005" and that it undergoes annealing by a factor of 100 using a cosine function over the duration of the training. This suggests that the hyperparameters were manually tuned or optimized through a trial-and-error process, but the exact method of optimization (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
