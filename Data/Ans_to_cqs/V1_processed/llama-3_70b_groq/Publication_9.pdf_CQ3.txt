Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is instance segmentation, specifically polygon mask contours directly around the fish body boundary. This is mentioned in the text as "we intentionally assigned all segmentation masks to create precise polygonal mask contours directly around the fish body boundary (i.e., where the foreground pixels of the target fish body meet those of the background)". This suggests that the annotation technique used is instance segmentation, where a precise boundary is drawn around the object of interest (in this case, the fish body) to create a mask. There is no mention of bounding box annotation in the provided context.
