Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, pseudo-labeling, and teacher-student structures in the training process. It discusses the limitations of previous studies, including the use of raw images with centimeter-level spatial resolution, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
