Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning in bioacoustic classification, particularly for marine mammals. It discusses the potential of deep neural networks for large datasets and the importance of significant sample sizes for all classes. However, it does not delve into the specifics of optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
