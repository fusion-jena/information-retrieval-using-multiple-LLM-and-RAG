I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses Land Surface Temperature (LST) retrieval, Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and artificial neural networks, but it does not provide information about a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
