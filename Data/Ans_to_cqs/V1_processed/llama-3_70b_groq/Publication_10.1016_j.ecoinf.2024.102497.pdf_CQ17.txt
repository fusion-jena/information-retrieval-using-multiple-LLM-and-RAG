The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context discusses various models used for bathymetry retrieval, including linear regression, CART, RFR, and SVM. However, it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipelines or regularization techniques.

In the context of CART and RFR models, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting are mentioned as fine-tuning specific model parameters. For CART, the parameters 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes' are set to 8, 5, and 20, respectively, to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error. For RFR, the model parameter 'n_estimators' is fine-tuned, but the specific value is not mentioned.

In summary, the context does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, but it does mention fine-tuning model parameters to prevent overfitting in CART and RFR models.
