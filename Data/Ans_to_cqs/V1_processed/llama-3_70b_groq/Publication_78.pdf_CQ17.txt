Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing various techniques and models used for image classification, particularly in the context of coral reef classification. It mentions different architectures such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3, but does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
