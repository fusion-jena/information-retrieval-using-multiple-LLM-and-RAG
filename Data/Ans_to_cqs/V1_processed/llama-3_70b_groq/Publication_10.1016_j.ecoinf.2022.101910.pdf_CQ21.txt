Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations using machine learning approaches, specifically BirdNET, and its performance in identifying bird species. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved in the model training process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
