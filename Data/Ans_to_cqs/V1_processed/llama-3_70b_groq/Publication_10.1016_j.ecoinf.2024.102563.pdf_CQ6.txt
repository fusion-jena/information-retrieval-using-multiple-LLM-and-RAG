Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on digital soil mapping, remote sensing, and classification algorithms, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of various classification algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). These algorithms may require different preprocessing steps, but the context does not provide specific details on these steps.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming the data to a specific range, such as -1 to 1, to improve model performance. Cleaning involves removing missing or noisy data, and feature engineering involves selecting and transforming the most relevant features for the model.

However, without specific information on the preprocessing steps used in the context, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
