I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on atmospheric correction algorithms for remote sensing imagery, specifically in aquatic environments, and does not discuss deep learning pipelines or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
