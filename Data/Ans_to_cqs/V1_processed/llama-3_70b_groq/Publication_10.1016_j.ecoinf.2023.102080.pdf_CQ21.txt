I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different covariate selection procedures and their impact on model accuracy and computation time. It discusses the results of the experiments, including the average computation time and model accuracy, but does not provide information on postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
