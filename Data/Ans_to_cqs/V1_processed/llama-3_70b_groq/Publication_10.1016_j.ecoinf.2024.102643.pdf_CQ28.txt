I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model on a specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be related to bioclimatic analysis, species conservation, and geospatial analysis, but it does not provide any information about the deployment of a deep learning model on a cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
