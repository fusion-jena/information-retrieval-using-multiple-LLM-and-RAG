I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of machine learning models, including deep learning, for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of HABs, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The acknowledgement section mentions the Clemson Computing and Information Technology (CCIT) and its Cyberinfrastructure Technology Integration (CITI) group, which suggests that the research may have utilized the university's computing resources, but it does not specify a particular cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
