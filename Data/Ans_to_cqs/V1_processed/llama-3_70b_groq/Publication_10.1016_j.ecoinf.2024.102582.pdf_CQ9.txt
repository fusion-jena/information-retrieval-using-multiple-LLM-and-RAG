I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for remote sensing data analysis, but it does not provide information about the availability of the deep learning pipeline or its data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
