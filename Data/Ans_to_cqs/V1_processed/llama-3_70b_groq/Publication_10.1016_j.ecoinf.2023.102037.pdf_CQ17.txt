Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on discussing the limitations of existing studies on insect image recognition, the importance of strict validation procedures, and the potential causes of misclassifications from both model-centric and data-centric perspectives. It also provides details on the imaging setup and data splitting and image tiling procedures. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
