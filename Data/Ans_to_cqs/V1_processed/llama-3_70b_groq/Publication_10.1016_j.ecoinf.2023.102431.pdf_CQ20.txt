I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a study on species and sex discrimination using footprints, and it mentions techniques such as discriminant analysis, predictor screening, and linear discriminant analysis. There is no mention of deep learning models or the hardware resources required to train them. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
