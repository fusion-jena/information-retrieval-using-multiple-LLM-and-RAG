I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context provides information about various research papers and studies related to deep learning and camera trap images, but it does not include a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a code repository.
