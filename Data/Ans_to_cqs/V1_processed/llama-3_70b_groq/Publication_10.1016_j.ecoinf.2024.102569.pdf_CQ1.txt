Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from public datasets, specifically from crowdsourcing platforms such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). These platforms provide data on species observations, which can be used as input for the deep learning pipeline. 

It does not seem that surveys or sensors are explicitly mentioned as methods for collecting raw data in this context. However, it is possible that the data collected from these crowdsourcing platforms may have originated from surveys or sensor data, but this is not explicitly stated.
