The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention "annotated data" and "data augmentation" as part of the training process.

Data annotation refers to the process of labeling or annotating the data with relevant information, which is used to train the model. Data augmentation, on the other hand, is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data.

While the context does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps, it is common practice in deep learning to perform these steps before training a model. Normalization involves scaling the data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves rescaling the data to a specific range, and cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, or missing values from the data.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps, it is likely that normalization, scaling, and cleaning are involved in the process, in addition to data annotation and augmentation.
