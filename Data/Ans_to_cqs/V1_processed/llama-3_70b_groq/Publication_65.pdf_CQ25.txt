The purpose of the deep learning models in this context is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the text, which states that the models "receive, as input, an image and return as output, another image, generally with the exact size of the input data with each pixel associated with one class." This description matches the definition of semantic segmentation, which involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. The models are being used to detect trees in urban areas, and the output is an image with each pixel labeled as either "tree" or "not tree".
