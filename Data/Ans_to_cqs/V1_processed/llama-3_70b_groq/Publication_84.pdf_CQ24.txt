Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in remote sensing for invasive species detection, specifically using phenological features to improve performance. It discusses the comparison of deep learning methods with traditional machine learning methods, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
