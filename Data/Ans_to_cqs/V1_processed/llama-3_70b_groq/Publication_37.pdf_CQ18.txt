The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation set to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy. The model is trained for 100 epochs and is checkpointed after each epoch. This allows the model to evaluate its performance on the validation set after each epoch and select the best-performing model.
