I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context discusses the use of ResNet-50 for feature extraction, the structure of the ResNet-50 model, and the training of an SVM classifier, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
