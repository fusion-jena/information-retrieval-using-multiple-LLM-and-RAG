The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. It only mentions that the experiments were performed on a computer running 64-bit Linux OS with two 2.3 GHz Intel 8-core processors. There is no mention of any specialized hardware for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
