Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of Unicode characters, mathematical symbols, and cryptic text, which does not provide any clear information about optimization techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. If you could provide more relevant information or context, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
