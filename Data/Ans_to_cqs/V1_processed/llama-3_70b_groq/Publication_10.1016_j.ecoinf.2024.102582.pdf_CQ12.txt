I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of random forest algorithm for land use type classification, but it does not provide information about the deep learning model used for individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests mentioned in the first reference (Lassalle et al., 2022).
