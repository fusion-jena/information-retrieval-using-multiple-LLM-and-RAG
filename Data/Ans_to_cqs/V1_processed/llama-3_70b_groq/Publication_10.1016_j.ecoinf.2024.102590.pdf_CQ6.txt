I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context discusses the supervised learning workflow, data collection, and land cover classification, but it does not provide information about preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
