Based on the provided context, it appears that the metric used to evaluate the performance of the model is the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The text states that "AUC close to 1 indicates high model quality, whereas 0 indicates low model quality" and that the authors used AUC to select the optimal hinge features and checked that all models used for species richness estimation reached at least a 0.75 AUC. 

There is no mention of other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall being used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, it can be concluded that AUC is the primary metric used for model evaluation in this context.
