I don't know.

The provided context does not mention model training or any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a study on animal vocalizations, where sounds are extracted based on signal parameters, and statistical analyses are performed using R and the "multcomp" package. There is no mention of machine learning or model training, which is typically where postprocessing steps like those mentioned would be relevant.
