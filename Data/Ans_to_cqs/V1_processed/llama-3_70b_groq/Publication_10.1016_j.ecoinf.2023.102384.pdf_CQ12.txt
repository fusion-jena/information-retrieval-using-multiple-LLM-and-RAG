The pipeline uses a Faster R-CNN model, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context as "Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2017), which is adopted in constructing the PCÎ¸ module." Faster R-CNN is a deep learning model used for object detection tasks, and it is a variant of the R-CNN model. It is not a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or a Transformer, but rather a CNN-based architecture.
