The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of AI image classifiers to social media image datasets for generating biodiversity observations and discusses potential biases in the data and the classification process. It does not delve into the technical aspects of the deep learning pipeline or random seed values.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
