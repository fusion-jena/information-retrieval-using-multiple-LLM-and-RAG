Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various aspects of machine learning, including classification performance, hyperparameters, and model preparation, but it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. 

However, it is worth noting that the paper by Tan et al. (2022) is titled "The impact of data augmentations on deep learning-based marine object classification in benthic image transects", which suggests that data augmentation techniques were used in their study. Unfortunately, the provided context does not include the details of their paper, so we cannot determine the specific techniques used.
