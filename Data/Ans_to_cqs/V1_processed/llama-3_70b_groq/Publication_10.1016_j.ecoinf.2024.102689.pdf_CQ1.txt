Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for deep learning pipelines in the field of fish recognition and monitoring is collected through various methods, including:

1. Underwater videos: Several studies mention the use of underwater videos to collect data on fish behavior, abundance, and species recognition (e.g., Spampinato et al., 2008; Tamou et al., 2018).
2. Electronic monitoring system videos: Tseng and Kuo (2020) use videos from electronic monitoring systems to detect and count harvested fish and identify fish types.
3. Real underwater fish data: Figure 1 in the context shows images of individual underwater fishes, suggesting that real-world data is collected through underwater observations or cameras.
4. Landings data: The study by Lu et al. (2020) uses data from harvested tuna and billfish to identify species using deep convolutional neural networks.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the context whether public datasets are used, but it is possible that some studies may utilize publicly available datasets for fish recognition tasks. However, the context does not provide specific information on the use of surveys or sensors for data collection.

Overall, the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines for fish recognition and monitoring appear to be primarily based on visual data from underwater videos and images.
