I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The text appears to discuss species distribution models (SDMs) and the effects of sample size and sampling bias on their performance. It mentions various approaches to correcting for sampling bias, but does not mention deep learning models or any related concepts. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
