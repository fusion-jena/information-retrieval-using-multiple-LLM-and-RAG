The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is 70% for training and 30% for testing. This is mentioned in the context as "The input of the training data was split into two sets; 70% of the samples were used for training and 30% for testing, to estimate the ability of the DNN algorithm to map burned areas in the study area."
