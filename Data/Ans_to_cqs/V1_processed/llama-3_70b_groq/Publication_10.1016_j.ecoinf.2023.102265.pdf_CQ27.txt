Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different ResNet models for feature extraction and their training times. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
