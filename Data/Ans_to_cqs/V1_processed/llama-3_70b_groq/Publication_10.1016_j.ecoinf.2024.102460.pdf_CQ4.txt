I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land use planning, ecological informatics, and optimization models, with discussions on LSTM models, Markov chain models, and multiobjective programming models. There is no mention of image processing or computer vision, which are typical domains where data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are applied. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
