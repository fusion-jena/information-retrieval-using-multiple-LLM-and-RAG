Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context discusses various CNN architectures such as DenseNet121, VGG16, ResNet-50, and a proposed model, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. It only mentions the Google Colab repository, which is a cloud-based platform for data science and machine learning, but it does not specify the framework used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
