I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or the hardware resources used for it. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, discussing variables such as temperature, humidity, and vegetation conversion efficiency, as well as data sources and spatial distributions of NDVI. There is no mention of deep learning models or hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
