The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, so it is not possible to determine what metrics are used to evaluate its performance. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are used to identify new ecoregions. The metrics mentioned in the context are related to the evaluation of redescriptions, such as accuracy (measured by the Jaccard coefficient) and support. However, these metrics are not used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.
