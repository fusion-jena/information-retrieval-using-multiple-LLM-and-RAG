I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context discusses fuzzy inference systems (FIS) and their implementation using the fuzzy logic toolbox in Matlab 2023b. It also describes the architecture of a tree-based FIS model, which is a hierarchical system of interconnected sub-FIS models. There is no mention of deep learning models or techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
