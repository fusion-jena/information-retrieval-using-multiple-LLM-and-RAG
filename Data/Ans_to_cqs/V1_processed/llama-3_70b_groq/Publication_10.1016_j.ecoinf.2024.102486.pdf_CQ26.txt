The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on particle filtering, Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and parallel computing, with no direct mention of deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

However, it does mention "data augmentation approaches" in the context of improving analysis on many-core CPUs and GPUs for animal audio classification. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of the training dataset, which can help address data bias. But it is not explicitly mentioned as a technique to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are not mentioned in the context.
