Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on performance metrics, data augmentation techniques, and different deep learning models used for plant disease classification. It does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
