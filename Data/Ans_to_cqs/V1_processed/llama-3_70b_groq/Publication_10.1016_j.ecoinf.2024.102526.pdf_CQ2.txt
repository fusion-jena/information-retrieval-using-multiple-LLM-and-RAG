Based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. There are multiple references to image-related metadata fields, such as image-camera-orientation, image-platform, image-illumination, image-scale-reference, and image-pixel-per-millimeter, among others. Additionally, there are fields related to image curation, annotation, and QAQC, which further suggest that image data is a central component of the pipeline.

There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context. However, there is a reference to yaml/json, which could potentially be used to store metadata or other types of data, but it is not clear if this is related to the deep learning pipeline.

There is also no mention of CSV (Comma Separated Values) as a data format in the provided context. 

In summary, based on the available information, it appears that image data is the primary format used in the deep learning pipeline, but it is unclear if other formats like audio, video, or CSV are used.
