I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and parameters used in the pipeline, including the learning rate, batch size, latent dimension, and loss functions, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
