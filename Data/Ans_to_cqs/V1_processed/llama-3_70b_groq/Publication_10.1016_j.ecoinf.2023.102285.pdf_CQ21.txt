Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

In Table 10, a detailed confusion matrix is presented, which outlines the true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), true negatives (TN), and false positives (FP) for each phase of the model evaluation. Additionally, the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC) are calculated and presented in the table.

There is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. It is possible that other postprocessing steps may be involved, but they are not explicitly mentioned.
