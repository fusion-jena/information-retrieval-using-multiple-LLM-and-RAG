I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological topics, with references to European Environment Agency, European Space Agency, and various research papers on habitat correlates, land cover, and conservation. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
