Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different basic models (ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7) and proposed ensemble methods on the IP102 dataset. It discusses the training strategy, hyper-parameters, and performance metrics, but does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
