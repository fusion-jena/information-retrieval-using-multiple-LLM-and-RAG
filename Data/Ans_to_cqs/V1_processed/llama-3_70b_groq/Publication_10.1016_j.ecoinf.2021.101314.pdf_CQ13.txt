I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any hyperparameters related to it, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which involves setting parameters for query complexity and accuracy, but it does not mention deep learning or neural networks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
