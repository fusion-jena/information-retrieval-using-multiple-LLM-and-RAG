Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the training phase of a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) and the optimization of hyperparameters. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that may have been performed on the data before feeding it into the model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular study. It is possible that the data was preprocessed in some way, but the context does not provide enough information to determine what steps were taken.
