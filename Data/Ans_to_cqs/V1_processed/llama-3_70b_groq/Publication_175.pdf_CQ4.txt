Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only mentions that data augmentation is a way to address the problem of limited data, citing references such as Wong et al. (2016) and Wang and Perez (2017). However, it does not provide details on the specific techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
