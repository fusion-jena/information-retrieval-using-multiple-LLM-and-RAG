Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of hyperparameters for Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree models using Optuna. It discusses the ranges of hyperparameters considered for optimization, the optimal parameters obtained, and the performance metrics of the models.

There is no mention of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given information.
