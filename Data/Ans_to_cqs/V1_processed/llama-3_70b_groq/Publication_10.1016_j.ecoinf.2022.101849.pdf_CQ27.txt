I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses various terms used to describe weakly supervised learning tasks, different types of noise in labeling processes, and a case study on predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. It also lists several references to other studies and papers, but none of them provide information about deploying a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
