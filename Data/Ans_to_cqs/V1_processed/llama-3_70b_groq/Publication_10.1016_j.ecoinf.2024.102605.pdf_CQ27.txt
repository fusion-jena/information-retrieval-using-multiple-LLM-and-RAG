I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental science, with no information about the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
