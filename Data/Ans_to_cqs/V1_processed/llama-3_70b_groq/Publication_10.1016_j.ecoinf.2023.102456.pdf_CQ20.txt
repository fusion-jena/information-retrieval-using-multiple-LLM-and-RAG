I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on machine learning concepts, such as backpropagation, neural networks, and the Gumbel-Softmax function, as well as forest fires and their impact on the environment. There is no mention of hardware resources like GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware components. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
