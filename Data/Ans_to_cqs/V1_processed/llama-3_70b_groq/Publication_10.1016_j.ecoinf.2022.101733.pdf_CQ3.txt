The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the classification process using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the analysis of different feature batches using the McNemar's test. It also discusses the challenges of gathering training and validation sample points in the field and the use of image interpretation for sample selection.

There is no mention of deep learning or annotation techniques in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given information.
