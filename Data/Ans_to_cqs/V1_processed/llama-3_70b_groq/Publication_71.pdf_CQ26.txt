The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does mention that augmenting the training dataset using different brightness levels, adding vertically and horizontally flipped versions, shifting, rotating, or adding noisy versions of the training images could be potential strategies to mitigate the issues when test data characteristics differ from the training data. This suggests that data augmentation techniques can be used to address data bias and improve the robustness of deep learning models.
