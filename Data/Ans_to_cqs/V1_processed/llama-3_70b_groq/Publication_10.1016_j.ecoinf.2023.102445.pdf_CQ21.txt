Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps include Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) as it is mentioned in the time metric calculation formula. 

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of metrics such as AP (average precision), mAP (mean average precision), and time metric, which suggests that these metrics are calculated as part of the postprocessing steps. 

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix as part of the postprocessing steps. Therefore, it can be concluded that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include NMS and metrics calculation, but the exact steps are not fully specified in the provided context.
