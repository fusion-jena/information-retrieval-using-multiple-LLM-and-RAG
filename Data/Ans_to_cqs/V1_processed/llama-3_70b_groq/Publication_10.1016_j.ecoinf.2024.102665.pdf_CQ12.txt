I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text mentions "a deep learning model" in the paper by Do and Tran (2023), but it does not specify the type of model used. The context also discusses other topics such as coral reefs, fish communities, and optimization algorithms, but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
