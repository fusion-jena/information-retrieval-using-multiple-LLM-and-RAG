Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, data collection, and training procedures for the CNN model, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

The context mentions the use of TensorFlow 2.5.0 for building and training the CNN model, but it does not discuss how the trained model was deployed or serialized for use in a production environment. Similarly, there is no mention of platform selection for model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
