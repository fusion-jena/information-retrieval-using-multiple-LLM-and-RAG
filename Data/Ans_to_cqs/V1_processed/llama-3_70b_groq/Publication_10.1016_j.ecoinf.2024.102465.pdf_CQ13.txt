I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only mentions the use of pre-trained models like ERNIE, LSTM-CNN, and HRNet, and provides information about the experimental setup, data processing, and indicator descriptions. However, it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in the models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
