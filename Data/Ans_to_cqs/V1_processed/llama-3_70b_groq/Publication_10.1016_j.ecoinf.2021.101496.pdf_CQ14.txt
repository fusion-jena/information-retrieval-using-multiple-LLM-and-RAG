The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it is mentioned that the fit of the ANN does not give the same output for each run because of a random number generator used for numerical optimization of the model. This suggests that the model may be using some form of random search for hyperparameter optimization, but the exact method is not specified. It is also possible that the hyperparameters were tuned manually or using some other method, but this information is not provided in the given context.
