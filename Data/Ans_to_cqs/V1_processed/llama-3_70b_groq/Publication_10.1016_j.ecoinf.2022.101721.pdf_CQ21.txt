Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the use of Bayesian statistics and ultrasound analysis for bat identification, and it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved in model training.

The context mentions that the full R-code for the analysis is provided in supplement S1, which includes the code for running the Bayesian algorithm and storing the results as a .csv file. However, it does not provide details on the postprocessing steps involved in model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
