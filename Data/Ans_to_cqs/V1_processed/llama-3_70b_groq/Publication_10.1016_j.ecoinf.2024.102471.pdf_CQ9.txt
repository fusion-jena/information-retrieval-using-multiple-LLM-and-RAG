I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various studies and models related to automatic speech recognition, bird species identification, and transfer learning, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
