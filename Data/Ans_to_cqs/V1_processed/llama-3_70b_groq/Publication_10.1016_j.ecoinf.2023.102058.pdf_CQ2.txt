The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the data format used is hyperspectral imagery, which is a type of image data. This is because the study involves the use of hyperspectral data from the EnMAP simulated data and AISA Eagle airborne imaging campaign to predict water quality parameters. The context also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms, including deep learning algorithms, to analyze this hyperspectral data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely to be image data, specifically hyperspectral images.
