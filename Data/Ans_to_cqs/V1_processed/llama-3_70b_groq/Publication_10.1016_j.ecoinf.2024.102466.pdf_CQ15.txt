I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text focuses on the performance of different object detection models (e.g., Cascade RCNN, FCOS, Faster RCNN) on camera trap images for bird recognition, and discusses their mAP scores, convergence rates, and suitability for the task. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training.
