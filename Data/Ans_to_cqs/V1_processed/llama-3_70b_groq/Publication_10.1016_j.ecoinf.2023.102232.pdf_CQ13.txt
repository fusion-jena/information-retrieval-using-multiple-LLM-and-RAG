I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The text discusses a hybrid algorithm that combines least squares methods with genetic algorithms and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to estimate model parameters from field data. It also mentions the computational tools used, including the DAFNE HPC scientific computing centre and the Python 3.6.8 package Ray. However, there is no mention of deep learning or any related hyperparameters.
