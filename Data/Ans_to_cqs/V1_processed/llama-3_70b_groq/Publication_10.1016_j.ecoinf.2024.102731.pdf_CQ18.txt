I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, ecosystem services, and urban planning, but it does not provide any information about a specific model or its training process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
