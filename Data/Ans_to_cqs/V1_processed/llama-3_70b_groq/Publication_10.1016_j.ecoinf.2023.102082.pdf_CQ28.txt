I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of Sentinel-2 optical images, LiDAR data, and deep learning approaches (convolutional neural networks) to estimate canopy height, but it does not provide information about the platform used for deployment.
