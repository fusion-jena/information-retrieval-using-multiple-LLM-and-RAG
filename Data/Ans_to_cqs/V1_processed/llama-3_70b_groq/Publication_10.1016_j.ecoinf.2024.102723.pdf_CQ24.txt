The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does discuss the importance of handling uncertainty in deep learning models, particularly in Bayesian Neural Networks.

In the context of Bayesian Neural Networks, the strategy employed to handle uncertainty is the use of probability theory to express uncertainty, especially in the prediction phase. This is achieved by placing a probability distribution over the model's parameters, which allows the model to quantify the uncertainty related to the data (aleatoric uncertainty) and the model itself (epistemic uncertainty).

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) and Variational Bayes Inference (VBI) approaches in the neural network architecture. These approaches can be seen as strategies to handle randomness and uncertainty in the model. Monte Carlo Dropout involves randomly dropping out neurons during training, which can help to prevent overfitting and provide a way to quantify uncertainty. Variational Bayes Inference is a method for approximating complex probability distributions, which can be used to handle uncertainty in the model's parameters.
