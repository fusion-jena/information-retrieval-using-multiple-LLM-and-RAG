I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research paper on seagrass detection in the Mediterranean using machine learning techniques, specifically supervised learning approaches. The paper discusses dataset integration and fusion, machine learning algorithms, and data mining, but it does not mention data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
