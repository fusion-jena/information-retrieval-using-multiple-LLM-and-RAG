The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The context does not mention any specific type of deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. It only mentions the use of an ANN with a single hidden layer, where the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate are determined using a trial-and-error method.
