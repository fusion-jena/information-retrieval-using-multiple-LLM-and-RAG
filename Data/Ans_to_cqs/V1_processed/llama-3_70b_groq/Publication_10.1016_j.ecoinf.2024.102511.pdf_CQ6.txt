Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning in bioacoustic classification, particularly in marine mammal research. It discusses the importance of automated classification routines, the potential of deep neural networks, and the need for significant sample sizes for all classes.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention data augmentation as a technique to enhance data or combine disparate datasets. This is mentioned in the context of addressing the issue of limited sample sizes for certain classes. Data augmentation is a preprocessing step that involves artificially increasing the size of a dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping.

While the context does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps, it is likely that normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important steps in preparing data for deep learning model training. These steps are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for model training.

In summary, the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, but it does mention data augmentation as a preprocessing technique. It is likely that other preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, are also important, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
