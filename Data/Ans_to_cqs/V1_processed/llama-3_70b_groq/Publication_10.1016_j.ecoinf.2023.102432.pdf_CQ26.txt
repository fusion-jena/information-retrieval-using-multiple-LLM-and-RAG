The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of using machine learning algorithms for ecology and conservation applications, particularly when dealing with imperfect training data.

However, it can be inferred that the MTMI-SMF approach is designed to work with imperfect data, which may include biased or unrepresentative data. The method groups pixels surrounding a training location that could have an invader, rather than relying on a single pixel to represent a training location. This approach may help to mitigate the effects of data bias, but it is not a specific technique used to address data bias during preprocessing.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
