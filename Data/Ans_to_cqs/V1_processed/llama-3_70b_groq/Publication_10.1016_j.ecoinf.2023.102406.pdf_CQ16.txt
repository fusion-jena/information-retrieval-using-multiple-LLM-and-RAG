The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the modeling approaches, variable reduction for correlation, and sample thinning, but it does not discuss the training process or the criteria for determining its completion.

However, it is mentioned that modeling package options enable automated tuning for parameters through resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final model configuration. This suggests that the modeling process may involve some form of iterative improvement until a satisfactory level of accuracy is achieved, but the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified.

In general, common criteria for determining when training is complete include convergence of the model's performance metrics, such as validation loss plateau, or reaching a predetermined number of iterations or epochs. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.
