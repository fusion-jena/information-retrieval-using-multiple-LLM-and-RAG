The provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. However, it does mention some related concepts and techniques.

For instance, the context mentions "Scaled-YOLOv4: Scaling cross stage partial network" (Wang et al., 2021), which is a deep learning architecture, but it does not specify the optimization technique used.

It also mentions "Searching for MobileNetV3" (Zhu et al., 2019), which is a paper about neural architecture search, but again, it does not provide information about the optimization technique used.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for image filtering and labelling, as well as instance segmentation of animal species in video clips, but it does not provide details about the optimization techniques used in these pipelines.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
