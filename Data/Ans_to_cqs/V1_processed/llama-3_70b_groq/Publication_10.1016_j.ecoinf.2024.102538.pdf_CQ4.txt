The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that data augmentation is performed on the fbank feature, and four examples of augmented data for the Acridotheres cristatellus sound are visualized in Figure 2.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide further details on the specific techniques used for data augmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
