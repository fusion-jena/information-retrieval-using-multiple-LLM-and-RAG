I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on natural language processing, word embeddings, and text analysis, with references to Word2vec, Skip-gram, and Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) architectures. It also discusses text preprocessing, tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal, but does not touch on deep learning pipelines or randomness handling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
