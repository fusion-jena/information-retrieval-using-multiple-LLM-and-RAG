Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the concept of deep learning, its development, and its application in ecological prediction, machine learning, and computational ecology. It does not delve into the specifics of data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
