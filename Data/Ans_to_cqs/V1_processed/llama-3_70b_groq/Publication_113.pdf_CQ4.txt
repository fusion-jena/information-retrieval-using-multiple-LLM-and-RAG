The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on active learning, dimensionality reduction, and transfer learning in the context of image classification. It discusses the use of a pre-trained detector model, embedding models, and query selection strategies for active learning. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
