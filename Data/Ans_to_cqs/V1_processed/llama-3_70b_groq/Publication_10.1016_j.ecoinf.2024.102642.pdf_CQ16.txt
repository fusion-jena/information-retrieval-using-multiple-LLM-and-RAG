According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is an early stopping method. The patience parameter is set at 10 epochs for all training phases. This means that the model training will stop when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving for 10 consecutive epochs. This is a common technique used to prevent overfitting and to determine when the model has converged.
