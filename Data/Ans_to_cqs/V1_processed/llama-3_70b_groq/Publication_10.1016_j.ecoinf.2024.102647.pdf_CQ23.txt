Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only discusses the evaluation criteria for the performance of machine learning models and briefly mentions feature selection, but it does not provide information on the methods used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
