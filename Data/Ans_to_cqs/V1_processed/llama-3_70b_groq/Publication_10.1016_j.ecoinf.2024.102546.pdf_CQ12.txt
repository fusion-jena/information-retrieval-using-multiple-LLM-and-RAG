The query asks about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. After reviewing the provided context, I found that the answer is not explicitly mentioned. However, I can provide some insights based on the context.

In the context, there are mentions of YOLO models, I3Net modules, and CNN-based modular spot sprayer. These suggest that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in some of the pipelines. Additionally, there are mentions of object detectors, which are often based on CNN architectures.

However, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline without more information. The context does not provide a clear answer to this question.

Therefore, I must conclude that I don't know the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
