I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where it can be found. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various machine learning techniques, including transductive propagation, active learning, and few-shot learning, and their applications in bioacoustic analysis. It does not provide any information about the implementation or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
