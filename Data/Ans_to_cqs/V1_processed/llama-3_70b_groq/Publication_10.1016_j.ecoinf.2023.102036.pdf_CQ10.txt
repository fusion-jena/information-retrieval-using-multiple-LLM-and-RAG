I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of deep learning techniques in ecology, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. The references cited are academic papers and do not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not available in the provided context.
