The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the WSGD dataset, which is specifically designed for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. This dataset is not a well-known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather a custom dataset created for this particular task. The WSGD dataset consists of 1764 image pairs, which were split into training (1232 image pairs), validation (176 image pairs), and testing (356 image pairs) sets.
