The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are Adam and RMSprop. These are specified as candidates for the optimizer parameter in the ANN algorithm. Additionally, the context also mentions the use of Optuna's LightGBM Tuner for hyperparameter fitting in the LightGBM models, but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the LightGBM pipeline.
