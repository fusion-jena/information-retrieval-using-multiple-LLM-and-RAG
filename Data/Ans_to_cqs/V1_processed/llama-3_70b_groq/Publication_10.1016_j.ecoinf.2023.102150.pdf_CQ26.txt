The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some insights into the data preprocessing and model training process.

From Table 1, we can see that the dataset is imbalanced, with a large number of images in the "Bad quality" and "Empty" classes, and a smaller number of images in the other classes. This imbalance could lead to biased model performance. However, the context does not mention any specific techniques used to address this bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

The only hint at addressing data bias is the mention of "refined training data" in the paper by Kavzoglu (2009), which suggests that the author may have used some technique to refine the training data to improve model accuracy. However, the exact technique used is not specified.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the query about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
