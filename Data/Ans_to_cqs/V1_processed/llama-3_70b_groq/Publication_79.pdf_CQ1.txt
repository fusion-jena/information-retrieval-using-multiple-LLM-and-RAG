The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that satellite imagery is used as a source of data, as mentioned in references 22, 24, 26, and 28. Specifically, it is mentioned that high spatial resolution satellite data is used in reference 26. Additionally, the context mentions the use of specific satellite bands, such as red, green, blue, and near-infrared (NIR) bands, which suggests that satellite imagery is a primary source of data.

It is also possible that the data is collected from public datasets, as reference 28 mentions a GitHub repository for deep U-net for satellite image segmentation. However, the context does not provide explicit information on surveys or sensors being used for data collection.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that satellite imagery is a primary source of data, and public datasets may also be used. However, the context does not provide explicit information on surveys or sensors being used for data collection.
