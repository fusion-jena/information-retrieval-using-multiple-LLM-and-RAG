I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The text only mentions that deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, were used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the available information.
