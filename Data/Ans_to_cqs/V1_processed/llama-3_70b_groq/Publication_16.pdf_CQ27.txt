Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, but it does not provide details on model deployment.

However, it can be inferred that the deployment and inferencing of the trained model in a test environment are discussed in Section IV (Evaluation and Discussion), but the specific details of the deployment process are not provided.

It is also mentioned that deploying trained models on edge devices for real-time inferencing will require consideration, but again, the specific process followed is not described.

Therefore, I don't know the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
