The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on active learning, dimensionality reduction, and neural networks. It discusses the active learning procedure, where a model is trained on a small, randomly selected labelled subset of data, and then the most informative unlabelled samples are selected for labelling. 

However, it does not provide information on how to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets, which is a crucial step in deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
