Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the concept of using deep learning for large-scale biodiversity monitoring, its benefits, and its potential applications. It does not provide any information about the implementation details, including the code repository. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
