The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention Microsoft COCO (Common Objects in Context) in the reference "Lin, T.-Y., et al., May 2014. Microsoft COCO: common objects in context." This suggests that the COCO dataset might be used in the pipeline, but it is not explicitly stated.

The context also discusses object detection models such as YOLOv5 and SSD, which are commonly used for tasks like object detection and image classification. These models are often trained on datasets like COCO, PASCAL VOC, or Open Images, but the specific dataset used in this pipeline is not mentioned.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the Microsoft COCO dataset might be used in the deep learning pipeline, but it is not explicitly stated. The exact dataset used in the pipeline is unknown.
