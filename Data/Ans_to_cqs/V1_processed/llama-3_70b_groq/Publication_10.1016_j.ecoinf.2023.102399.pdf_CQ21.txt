Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model selection, fish image collection method, and the results of the model evaluation. It discusses the performance metrics such as RMSE, MRE, and R2, but it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved, as the results of the model evaluation are presented in terms of RMSE, MRE, and R2. Additionally, the context mentions the identification of accuracy, which might imply the calculation of a confusion matrix. However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
