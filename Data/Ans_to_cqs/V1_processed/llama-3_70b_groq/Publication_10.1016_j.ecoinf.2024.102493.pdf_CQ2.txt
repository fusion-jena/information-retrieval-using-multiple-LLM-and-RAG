The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing data, specifically NDVI data from the MOD13A2 dataset, and various drivers related to climate, terrain, and human activity. The data formats mentioned in the context are related to these datasets, such as raster data (e.g., NDVI images) and CSV files (e.g., for storing driver data). However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or specific data formats used in such a pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
