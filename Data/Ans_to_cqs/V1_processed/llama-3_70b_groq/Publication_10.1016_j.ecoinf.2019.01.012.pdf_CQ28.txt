I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in ecological informatics, repeat photography, and landscape classification, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
