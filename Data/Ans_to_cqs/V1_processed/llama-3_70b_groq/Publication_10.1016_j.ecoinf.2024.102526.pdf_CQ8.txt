I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological monitoring, satellite and aerial images, and data collection, but it does not provide information about a code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
