The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics and results. 

The context mentions that the model had a true positive rate of 89.3% and a true negative rate of 91.9% using a standard acceptance threshold of 0.5. It also mentions that using a more conservative 0.1 acceptance threshold, the model had a 95.7% true positive rate and a 76.1% true negative rate. This suggests that some metrics calculation was involved, but the exact postprocessing steps are not specified.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these steps were involved in the postprocessing of the model.
