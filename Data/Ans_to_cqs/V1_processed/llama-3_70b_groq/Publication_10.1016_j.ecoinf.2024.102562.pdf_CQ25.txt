The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Mask-RCNN algorithm, is instance segmentation. This is stated in the context as "We adapted an instance segmentation algorithm based on Mask-RCNN." Instance segmentation involves identifying and segmenting individual objects or instances within an image, which in this case are bacteria. The model is trained to accurately segment bacteria within complex images, allowing for the quantification of bacterial populations and the detection of differences among bacterial communities from different locations.
