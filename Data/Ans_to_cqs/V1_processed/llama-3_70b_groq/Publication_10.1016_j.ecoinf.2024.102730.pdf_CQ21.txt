Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. SHAP values calculation: After training the MLP models, SHAP values were computed using the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method to understand which features are most important in predicting the start and (height of the) peak of the greening season.

No other postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context does mention the use of three standard metrics (MSE, MAE, and r2) for evaluating the model's performance, but it does not specify whether these metrics are calculated as a postprocessing step after model training.

It is possible that other postprocessing steps may have been performed, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
