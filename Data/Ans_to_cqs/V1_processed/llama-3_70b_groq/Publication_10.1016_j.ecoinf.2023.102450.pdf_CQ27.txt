I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training of the model using a Siamese network and few-shot learning, and provides details on the experimental setup, including the hardware and software used. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
