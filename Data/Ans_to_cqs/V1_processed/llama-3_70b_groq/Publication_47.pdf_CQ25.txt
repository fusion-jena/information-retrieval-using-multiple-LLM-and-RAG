The purpose of the deep learning model, IUC-NN, is classification. Specifically, it is designed to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species. The model takes in four groups of features (geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic) derived from digitally available occurrence records and outputs a prediction of the species' conservation status.
