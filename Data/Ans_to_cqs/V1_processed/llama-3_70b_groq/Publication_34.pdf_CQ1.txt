Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods to species distribution modeling and provides information about the dataset used, species selection, and environmental data. It does not provide details on how the raw data was collected.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the study is based on citizen programs in biodiversity sciences, which suggests that the data might have been collected through citizen science initiatives, such as crowdsourced observations or surveys. Additionally, the context mentions "finely geolocated plant species observations," which implies that the data might have been collected using GPS-enabled devices or other location-based technologies.

Despite these inferences, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
