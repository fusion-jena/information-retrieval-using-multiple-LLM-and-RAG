Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the model, including the SPPF module, Conv operations, and feature fusion techniques. It also discusses the application of deep learning models in pest detection and counting tasks, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
