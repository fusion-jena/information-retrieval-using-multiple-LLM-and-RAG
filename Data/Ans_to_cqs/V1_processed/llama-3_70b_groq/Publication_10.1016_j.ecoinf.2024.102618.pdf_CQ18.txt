The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the preprocessing step, the proposed model, and the use of class weights to handle imbalanced classes. It also presents the performance metrics used to evaluate the models, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
