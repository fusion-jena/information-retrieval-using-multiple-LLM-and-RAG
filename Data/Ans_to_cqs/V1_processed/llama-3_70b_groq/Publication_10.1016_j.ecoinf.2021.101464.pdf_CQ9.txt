I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the application of random forest models and suggests the use of big data theory and technology, neural networks, and other deep-level data mining methods to understand the influence of forest microclimate on NAI. However, it does not provide information about the availability of the data repository or the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
