I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the AutoML procedure, architecture, and performance of different models (ResNet, InceptionTime, LSTM, CNN) in case studies, as well as references to various papers on deep learning and ecology. There is no mention of data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks to label and prepare data for model training.
