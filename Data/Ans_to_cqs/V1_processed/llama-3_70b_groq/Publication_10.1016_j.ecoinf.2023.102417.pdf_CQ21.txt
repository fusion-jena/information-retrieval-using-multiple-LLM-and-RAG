Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model development, training, and evaluation process, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps.

However, it does mention the evaluation metrics, but it does not elaborate on the specific metrics used or how they are calculated. It only mentions that the model is trained to reach a high classification accuracy on the labeled biocrust images.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
