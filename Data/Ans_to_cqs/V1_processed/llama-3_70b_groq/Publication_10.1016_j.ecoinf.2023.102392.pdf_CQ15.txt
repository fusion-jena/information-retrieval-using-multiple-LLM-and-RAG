The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the ABC optimization technique in the context of an inference system, but it does not specify its application in the deep learning model. Additionally, it discusses the XGBoost model, which is an extreme gradient boosting model, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
