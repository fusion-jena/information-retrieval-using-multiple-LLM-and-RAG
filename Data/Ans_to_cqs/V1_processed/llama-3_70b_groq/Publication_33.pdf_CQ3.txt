The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification and species identification. It also mentions the use of a classification model, risk threshold tuning, and confidence thresholds. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

The context does mention the use of images and datasets (T0 and T1) for training and tuning the classification model, but it does not provide details on how the images were annotated or prepared for use in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in this context.
