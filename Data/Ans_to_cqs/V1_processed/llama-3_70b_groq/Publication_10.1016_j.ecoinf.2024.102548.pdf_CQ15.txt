Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context focuses on the architectures of different CNN models (EfficientNet, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2) and the use of transfer learning and RNNs, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
