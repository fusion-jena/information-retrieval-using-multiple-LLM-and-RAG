I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of research papers and articles related to environmental and ecological topics, with mentions of various machine learning and data analysis techniques, including deep learning. However, there is no reference to a specific code repository or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
