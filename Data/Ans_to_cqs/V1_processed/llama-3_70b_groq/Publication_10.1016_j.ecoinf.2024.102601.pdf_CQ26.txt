The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on optimizing data structures for ML classification, hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, and the challenges of using XAI techniques. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
