The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

1. Horizontal flip
2. Gaussian noise addition
3. Contrast reduction

These techniques were employed to increase the training set size fourfold, as the initial set of 290 training images was found to be insufficient to obtain satisfactory results.
