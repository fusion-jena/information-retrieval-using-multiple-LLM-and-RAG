I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the AlexNet model, its advantages, and its application in image scene classification tasks. It also discusses the use of CNN models in predicting water quality and algal blooms, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
