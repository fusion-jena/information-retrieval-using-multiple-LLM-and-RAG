I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses various machine learning and deep learning models used for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration, including LSTM, SVR, GA, PSO, BPNN, GRU, SVM, and ELM, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
