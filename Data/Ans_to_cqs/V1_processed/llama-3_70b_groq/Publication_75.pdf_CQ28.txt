I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the experimental setup, network architecture, and performance evaluation of various deep learning models for image retrieval tasks. It does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
