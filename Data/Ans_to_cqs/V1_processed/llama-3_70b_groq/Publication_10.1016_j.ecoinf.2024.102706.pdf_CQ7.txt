The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models. This suggests that the data was split into training and testing sets, but the exact proportions or criteria for this split are not specified. Additionally, there is no mention of a validation set. Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
