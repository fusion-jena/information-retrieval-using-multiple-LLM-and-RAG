The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is monitored through the loss rate and accuracy metrics. The context mentions that the proposed model is distinguished by a low loss rate and high accuracy, and that the model's performance is illustrated in Fig. 11, which suggests that the model's performance is being tracked and evaluated during training. Additionally, the context compares the performance of the proposed model with other models, which implies that the performance is being monitored and compared during training. However, the specific strategy or method used to monitor the model's performance is not explicitly stated.
