I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its performance evaluation metrics. The text discusses complex network measures, specifically the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL), and its application to analyzing the urban acoustic environment. It also mentions sound event classification using machine learning approaches, but it does not provide information about the performance evaluation metrics used for these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
