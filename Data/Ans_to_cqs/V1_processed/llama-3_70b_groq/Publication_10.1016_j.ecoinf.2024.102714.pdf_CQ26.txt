The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning pipelines or techniques to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does mention stratified random sampling points generated using QGIS' ACATAMa plug-in to account for bias associated with restricted inclusion probabilities that result from the pre-defined distribution of GMEP squares. This suggests that stratified random sampling is used to address bias in the data. 

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection techniques in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing.
