The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the evaluation of model performance using training scores and validation scores, as well as feature selection procedures like forward feature selection. It discusses the use of 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and spatial CV to calculate validation scores, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
