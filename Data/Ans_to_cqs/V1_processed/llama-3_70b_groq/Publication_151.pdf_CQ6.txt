The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the evaluation of DEPP on simulated data sets, training and parameter sensitivity, and the placement of query sequences onto a reference tree. It discusses the training process, loss function, and model selection, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
