I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. The context appears to be discussing redescription mining, a method that combines partitioning and modeling techniques to identify local patterns in data. It does not provide any information about addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
