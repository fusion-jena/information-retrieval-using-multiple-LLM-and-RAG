I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to mangrove tree segmentation using LiDAR data and an improved KNN algorithm, but it does not provide information about the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
