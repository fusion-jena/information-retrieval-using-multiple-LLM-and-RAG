I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline of BirdNET is available. The text mentions various sources such as Xeno-canto database and the Macaulay library of sounds, but it does not provide information about the repository of the BirdNET pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository where the data is available.
