I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the advantages of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, their performance, and the importance of dataset quality and quantity for training. It also references some studies and databases, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
