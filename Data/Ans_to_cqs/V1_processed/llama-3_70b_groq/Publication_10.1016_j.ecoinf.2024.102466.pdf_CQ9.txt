I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the study, its methodology, and its results, but it does not provide information about the data repository. The context mentions the dataset used in the study, which comprises 9717 images of 15 wild bird species acquired by camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park, but it does not specify where this dataset is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available.
