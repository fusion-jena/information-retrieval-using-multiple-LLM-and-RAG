Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, its application to computer vision tasks, and its comparison with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It discusses the self-attention mechanism, the use of a hybrid design combining ViT with a CNN backbone, and an improved SoftMax function to enhance robustness. However, it does not provide information on optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
