The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of a ResNet-50 network architecture, transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization method used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
