Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in the text as "the gap between training and validation accuracy is caused by using dropout on the training data only." Additionally, data augmentation is also mentioned as a technique used on the training data, which can also help prevent overfitting. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.
