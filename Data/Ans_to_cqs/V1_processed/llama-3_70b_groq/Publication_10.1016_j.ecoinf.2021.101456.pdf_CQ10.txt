I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a description of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their components, including the probabilistic encoder, decoder, and optimization objective. It also mentions the architecture of a VAE model and its application to a specific dataset. However, there is no mention of a code repository or a link to a specific implementation of the model.
