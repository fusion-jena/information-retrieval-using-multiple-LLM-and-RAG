I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the proposed hierarchical classification model, its practical deployment as a smartphone-based application, and various research papers related to plant species identification using machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, it does not provide information about the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
