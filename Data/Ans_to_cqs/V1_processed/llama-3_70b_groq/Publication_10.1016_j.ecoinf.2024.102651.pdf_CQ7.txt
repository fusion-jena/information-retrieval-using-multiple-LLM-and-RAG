Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the performance of different classification networks on a dataset, comparing their accuracy in classifying objects of different sizes. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
