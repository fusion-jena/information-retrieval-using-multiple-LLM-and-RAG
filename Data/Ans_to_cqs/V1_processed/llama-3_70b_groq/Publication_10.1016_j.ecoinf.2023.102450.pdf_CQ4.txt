I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to wildlife videos and deep learning techniques, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The references provided are related to object detection, tracking, and recognition in wildlife videos, but they do not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
