The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the text, it can be inferred that top-1 accuracy and top-5 accuracy are used as evaluation metrics. In the section "B. Deep Learning Experiment", it is mentioned that "Top-5 accuracy is almost a 100% with the biased dataset, while it drops to 51% with the unbiased dataset. Similarly, with top-1 accuracy the difference is around 50%." This suggests that top-1 and top-5 accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of the model. Other common metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are not mentioned in the provided context.
