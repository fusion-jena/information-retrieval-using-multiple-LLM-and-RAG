I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the performance of various deep learning models in plant disease classification tasks, comparing their accuracy and other metrics. It also mentions some techniques used in deep learning, such as hyperparameter optimization and feature extraction, but does not discuss handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
