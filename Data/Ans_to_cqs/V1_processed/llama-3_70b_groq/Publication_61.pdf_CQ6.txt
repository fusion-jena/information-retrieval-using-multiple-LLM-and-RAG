Based on the provided context, it appears that the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include resizing the images to 32 × 32 and normalization. This is mentioned in the section 5.1. Data augmentation accuracy, where it is stated that the patches are resized to 32 × 32 and normalized as a baseline for comparison with other data augmentation techniques.

It is not explicitly mentioned if any other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning are involved. However, it can be inferred that the images are not cleaned or preprocessed in any other way, as the focus is on comparing the effect of different data augmentation techniques on the model's accuracy.

It is also worth noting that the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps that might be commonly used in deep learning, such as feature scaling, feature selection, or handling missing values. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these steps are not involved, but rather that they are not mentioned in the provided context.
