The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the Res_AUNet network, is semantic segmentation, particularly for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. This is evident from the context, which mentions the model's performance metrics, such as Accuracy, F1-score, and IOU, which are commonly used to evaluate semantic segmentation models. Additionally, the comparison with other semantic segmentation networks, such as UNet, PSPNet, and HRNet, further supports this conclusion. The model's goal is to accurately identify and separate water sun glint regions from the rest of the image, providing valuable insights for eliminating water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.
