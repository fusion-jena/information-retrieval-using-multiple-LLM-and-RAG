I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, random seed values, or strategies to handle randomness. The context appears to be discussing dynamic data citations, repositories, and data aggregation, with a focus on supporting query-based data downloads and specifying subsets of data. It does not provide any information related to deep learning or handling randomness in pipelines. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
