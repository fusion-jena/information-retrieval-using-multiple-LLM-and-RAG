According to the provided context, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is the average training loss. The text states, "The average training loss was used to determine when to stop the training." This implies that the training process is stopped when the average training loss reaches a certain threshold or plateaus, indicating that the model has converged and further training is unlikely to improve its performance.
