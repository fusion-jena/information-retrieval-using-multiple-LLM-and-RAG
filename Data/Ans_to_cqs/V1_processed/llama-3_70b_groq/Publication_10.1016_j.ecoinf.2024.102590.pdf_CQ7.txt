The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the supervised learning workflow, specifically the Random Forest classifier, and the process of collecting and preparing the data for woody cover classification. 

However, it can be inferred that the data was split into training and validation points, as mentioned in Section 2.3.2, where the authors collected the training and validation points from the sampling plots within each vegetation type. The context does not provide information on how the data was split or what criteria were used for this split. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
