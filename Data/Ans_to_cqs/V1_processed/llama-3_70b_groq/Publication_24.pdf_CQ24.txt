Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning tools for urban ecoacoustic assessment, discussing the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other techniques for audio classification and biodiversity assessment.

While the context mentions the random selection of a dataset from remaining sites, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
