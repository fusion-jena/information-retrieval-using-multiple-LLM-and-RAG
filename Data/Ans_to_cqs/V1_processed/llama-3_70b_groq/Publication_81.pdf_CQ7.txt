I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically the ESK model, for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. It discusses the use of Elastic Net to address overfitting and improve generalization ability, as well as the employment of EN-SAE and KDE techniques for feature extraction and threshold determination. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for model training.
