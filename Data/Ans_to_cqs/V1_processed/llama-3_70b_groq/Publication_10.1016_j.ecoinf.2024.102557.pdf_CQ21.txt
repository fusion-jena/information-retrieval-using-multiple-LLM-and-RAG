The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training of random forest models for predicting mushroom productivity using the "ranger" R package and hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization. 

However, it does mention the use of environmental cross-validation with ten folds to evaluate the performance of the models, which implies that some form of model evaluation or metrics calculation might be involved. But the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps or confusion matrix, are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
