I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using different algorithms such as Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine, and compares their performance. It also mentions the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, but it does not provide information about the platform used to deploy the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
