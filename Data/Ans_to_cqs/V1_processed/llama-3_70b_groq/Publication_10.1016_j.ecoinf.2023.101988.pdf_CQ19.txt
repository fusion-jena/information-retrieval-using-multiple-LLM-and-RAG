I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of deep learning in acoustic monitoring and biodiversity modeling, but it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the deep learning model.
