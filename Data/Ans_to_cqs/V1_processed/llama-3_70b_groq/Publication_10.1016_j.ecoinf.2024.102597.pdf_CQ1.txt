The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite imagery from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Landsat satellites to estimate water quality parameters. It also mentions the use of measured data from 2017 to 2019 for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations in lakes. 

It can be inferred that satellite imagery and in-situ measurements are potential sources of raw data for the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide a comprehensive list of methods utilized for collecting raw data. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
