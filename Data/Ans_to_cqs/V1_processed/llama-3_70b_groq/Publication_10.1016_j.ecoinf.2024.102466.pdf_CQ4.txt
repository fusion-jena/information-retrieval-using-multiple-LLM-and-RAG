Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the dataset, the deep learning algorithms used for bird object detection, and the evaluation of their performance. It does not provide information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
