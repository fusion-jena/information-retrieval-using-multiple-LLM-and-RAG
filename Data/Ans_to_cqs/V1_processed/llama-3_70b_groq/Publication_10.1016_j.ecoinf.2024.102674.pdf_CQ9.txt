I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article that discusses various topics such as microclimatic challenges, climate relicts, species distribution models, and microclimate ecology. It cites several references and R packages, but it does not provide information about a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
