I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning techniques for classifying aquatic plant communities using remote sensing data. It mentions various algorithms and techniques, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and MARS, but does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
