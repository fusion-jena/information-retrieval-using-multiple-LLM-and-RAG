The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as a well-known dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the model is pre-trained on a broad dataset, specifically ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), which is a common practice in transfer learning. The actual dataset used for training and testing the model is a custom dataset consisting of multitemporal data from three environments, with images drawn from a three-month span (March, September, and October 2015). This dataset is expanded by tripling the image pool for each transect, resulting in a larger dataset for training and testing the deep learning models.
