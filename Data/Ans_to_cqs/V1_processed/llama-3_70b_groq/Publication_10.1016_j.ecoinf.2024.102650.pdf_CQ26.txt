The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on text processing, data cleaning, and theme perception technology using machine learning models, particularly the ERNIE model. It discusses data cleaning steps such as text filtering and Chinese text segmentation, but it does not address data bias or provide information on techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to this specific question.
