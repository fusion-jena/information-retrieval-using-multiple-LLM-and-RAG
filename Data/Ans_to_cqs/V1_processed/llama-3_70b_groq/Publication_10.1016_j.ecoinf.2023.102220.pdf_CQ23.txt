According to the provided context, cross-validation was used to ensure the generalizability of the model. Specifically, k-fold cross-validation was employed to choose the values of m, d* cluster, d* base, and Î±, such that the accuracy of the method is optimized. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability. The context only mentions that the implementation of the classification methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, and that the accuracy, true positive rate, and false positive rate were obtained using training-test splits of the time series.
