The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is prediction, specifically time series forecasting. The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is used to solve the prediction problem of time series data, particularly for long-term dependency and multivariate time series data. This is stated in section 4.3.3 of the provided context. The LSTM model is compared with the BP model and the Markov chain model, indicating that its purpose is to predict future values in a time series. 

Additionally, the LSTM model is part of a larger framework (LSTM-PLUS-FMOP) that aims to simulate future land use scenarios and optimize land allocation. The LSTM model is used for time series forecasting, which is then used as input for the PLUS model to analyze the driving mechanism of land expansion and explore the land conversion pattern.
