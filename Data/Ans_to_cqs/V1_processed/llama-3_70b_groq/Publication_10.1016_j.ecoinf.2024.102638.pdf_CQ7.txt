The context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset is divided into training sets, which comprise 80% of the data, and a test set representing the remaining 20%. This division is done by random sampling to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimize the risk of bias. There is no mention of a validation set, which is typically used in deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
