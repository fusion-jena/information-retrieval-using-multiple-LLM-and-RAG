The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of image augmentation techniques, which introduce randomness into the pipeline. 

Specifically, the context mentions the use of the keras image_data_generator function for image augmentation, which includes random assignment of the following: rotation 0–40, width and height shift range of 20%, shear range 0–0.2 rad, zoom range 0–0.2 scalar range, a horizontal flip, and a fill mode with the nearest pixel. 

While this does not directly address the question of handling randomness in the pipeline, it suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of introducing randomness into the training process to improve model robustness. However, the context does not provide further information on how randomness is handled or controlled in the pipeline.
