Based on the provided context, it appears that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are used in the pipeline. This is mentioned in the following references: 

* Kumar, A., Gorai, A.K., 2023. A comparative evaluation of deep convolutional neural network and deep neural network-based land use/land cover classifications of mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data.
* Meng, H., Zhang, J., Zheng, Z., Song, Y., Lai, Y., 2024. Classification of inland lake water quality levels based on Sentinel-2 images using convolutional neural networks and spatiotemporal variation and driving factors of algal bloom.

However, it is not clear if other types of deep learning models, such as RNN or Transformer, are used in the pipeline.
