The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are partially mentioned in the provided context. The learning rate is mentioned as 1e-3 for most networks, except for ResNet_v2, which has a learning rate of 1e-5. The batch size is set to 128, which means the model is trained with 128 images for each iteration. However, it is also mentioned that the batch size was initially set to 64 in the BatNet network. 

The optimizer is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It is also not clear what optimizer was used in conjunction with the mentioned learning rates.
