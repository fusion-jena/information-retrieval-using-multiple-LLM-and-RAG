The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the data splitting, model construction, hyperparameter tuning, and model performance evaluation. It discusses the use of GridSearchCV with cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
