I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of XGBoost to land use/land cover classification and forest type categorization using remote sensing data. It includes tables and figures presenting the results of the study, but it does not provide any information about the code used to implement the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
