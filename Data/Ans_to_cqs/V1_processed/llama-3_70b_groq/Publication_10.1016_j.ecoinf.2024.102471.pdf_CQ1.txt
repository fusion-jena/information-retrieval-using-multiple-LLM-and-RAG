Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method mentioned is the use of a digital recorder and a unidirectional microphone to record bird vocalizations by the Central Poultry Development Organization (CPDO) in Bhubaneswar, India. This suggests that audio recordings are collected in the field using specialized equipment.

No other methods of raw data collection are explicitly mentioned in the provided context, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. It is possible that other methods may be used in deep learning pipelines, but they are not mentioned in this specific context.

Therefore, the answer is that audio recordings are collected using digital recorders and microphones, but other methods are not mentioned.
