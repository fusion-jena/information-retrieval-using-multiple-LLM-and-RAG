I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses landslide vulnerability assessment using machine learning models, including ensemble techniques, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). It also mentions other machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and XGBoost. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
