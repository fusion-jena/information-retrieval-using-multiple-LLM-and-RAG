The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the experiments conducted to assess the generalization of models among different geographic sites and the sensitivity of the model to the number of hand-annotations. It discusses the different approaches to model training, such as within-site, cross-site, transfer learning, and universal models, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
