I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The text appears to be discussing gaping in bivalve species, metabolic functions, and data analysis in R. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
