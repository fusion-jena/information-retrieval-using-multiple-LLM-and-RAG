I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a study on Amur tigers, discussing the collection of trails and footprints, and the extraction of variables from footprint images. It also mentions references to various studies and papers on tigers and monitoring techniques, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
