Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses hyperparameter optimization, model evaluation, and the importance of experimentation in resolving uncertainty, but it does not provide specific information on techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
