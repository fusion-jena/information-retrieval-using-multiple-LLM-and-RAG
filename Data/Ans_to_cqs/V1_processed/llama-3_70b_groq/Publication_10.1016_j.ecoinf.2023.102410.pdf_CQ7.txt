I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to acoustic tracking and data analysis, discussing the tracking of vocalizations and the use of TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) to determine likely tracks. There is no mention of deep learning or data splitting for model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
