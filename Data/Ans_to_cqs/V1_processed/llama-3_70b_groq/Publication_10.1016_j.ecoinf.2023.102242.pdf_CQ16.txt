I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are concepts typically related to machine learning model training. The context appears to be discussing remote sensing image classification, object-based image analysis, and species classification, but it does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
