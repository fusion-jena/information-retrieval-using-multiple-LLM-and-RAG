Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from various sources, including:

1. Monitoring network: The frequency of data collection from this source is weekly, and the granularity is at the level of a "monitoring task".
2. Satellite images: Data is collected every 2-3 days, with a granularity of 100 km2 granules.
3. Weather: Daily data collection is performed, with a granularity of 25 km2 cells.
4. Environment: Yearly data collection is performed, with a granularity of "environmental element".

It is not explicitly mentioned that surveys are used for collecting raw data. However, the context suggests that the monitoring network and weather data might be collected through sensors or other automated means. The satellite images are likely collected through satellite imagery. The environmental data might be collected through a combination of sensors, surveys, or other methods, but the exact method is not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions CASE, which appears to be a system that collects data from users (on-field operators) through questionnaires or tasks. This data is stored in a relational database and is used to provide a customized and efficient user experience.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this pipeline include satellite imagery, weather sensors, and monitoring networks, as well as data collected through questionnaires or tasks from users. However, the exact methods used for collecting environmental data are not specified.
