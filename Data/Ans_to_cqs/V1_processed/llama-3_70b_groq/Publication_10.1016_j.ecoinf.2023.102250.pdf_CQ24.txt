Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a DR-ACGAN model, specifically the generator structure and its components, including residual blocks and attention mechanisms.

However, it is common in deep learning to employ strategies to handle randomness, such as:

1. Fixing the random seed value: This ensures reproducibility of results by setting the random seed to a fixed value, allowing for identical random number generation across different runs.
2. Using random number generators: Libraries like NumPy provide random number generators that can be used to generate random numbers in a controlled manner.
3. Data shuffling: Shuffling the training data can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process.

These strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, but they are common practices in deep learning.
