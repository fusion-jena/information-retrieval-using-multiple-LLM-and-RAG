I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning model, including CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The text discusses the use of remote sensing data from various sources, including Google Earth Engine, and the processing of NDVI data. It also mentions the authors' contributions to the study, but there is no mention of a deep learning model being used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
