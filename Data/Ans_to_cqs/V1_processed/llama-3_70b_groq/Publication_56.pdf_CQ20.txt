The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the methodology and results of the training process, including the use of 70% of the data for training and 30% for validation, the evaluation of interpretability, and the performance of the model. There is no mention of GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware resources. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
