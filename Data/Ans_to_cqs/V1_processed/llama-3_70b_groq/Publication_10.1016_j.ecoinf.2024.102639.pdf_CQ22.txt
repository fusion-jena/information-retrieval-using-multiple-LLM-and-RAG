The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in classifying left and right movements of zebrafish and rats in a T-maze environment.

Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances. F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances among all instances.

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, including KNN, SVM, and PCA-SVM, in classifying the movements of zebrafish and rats. The results show that the PCA-SVM approach achieved remarkable accuracy rates of 98.07% for zebrafish and 98.15% for rats, highlighting its exceptional capability in interpreting complex behavioral data with minimal error.
