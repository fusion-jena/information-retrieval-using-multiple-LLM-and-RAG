I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the performance of different machine learning models, including XGBoost and random forests, on habitat variables datasets. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository as it is not available in the provided context.
