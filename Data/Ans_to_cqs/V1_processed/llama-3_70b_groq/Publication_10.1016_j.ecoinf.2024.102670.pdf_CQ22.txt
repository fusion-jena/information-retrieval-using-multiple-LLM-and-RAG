According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Average precision
2. Recall
3. F1-measure
4. MMC (no further explanation is provided about what MMC stands for)

These metrics are mentioned in Section 2.5.1, where the authors computed them for the three different sets of fungal images.

Additionally, in Section 2.5.2, the authors use Lin's Concordance Coefficient (œÅc) to assess the strength of agreement between the gold standard method (manual tracing) and the proposed automated method measuring the mycelium length.

No mention of accuracy is made in the provided context.
