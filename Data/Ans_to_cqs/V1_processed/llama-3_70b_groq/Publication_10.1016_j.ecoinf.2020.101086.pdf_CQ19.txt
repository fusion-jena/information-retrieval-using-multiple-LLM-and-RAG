I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and the challenges of building these models with limited data, including sampling bias and a low number of presence sites. It also references a paper by Wisz et al. (2008) on the effects of sample size on the performance of SDMs. There is no mention of deep learning or any specific frameworks used to build such models.
