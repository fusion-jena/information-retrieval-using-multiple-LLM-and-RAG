I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context only mentions that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model was used to generate synthetic connectivity data, and it provides a brief description of how GAN models work. However, it does not provide any information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
