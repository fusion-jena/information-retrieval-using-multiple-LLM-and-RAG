I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to a study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using Random Forest and spectral indices, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
