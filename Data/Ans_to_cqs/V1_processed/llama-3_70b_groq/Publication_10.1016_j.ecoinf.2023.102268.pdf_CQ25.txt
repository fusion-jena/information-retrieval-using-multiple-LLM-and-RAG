The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the ResNet-50 CNN, is for classification. The model is used to classify candidate detections into 'boatwhistles' or 'other' signals. The activations from the fully connected layer (fc1000) of the ResNet-50 are used as feature vectors for each detected signal, which are then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify the optimal decision boundary to differentiate between the two classes. The classification model is trained on a labeled dataset, and the performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix on the test data.
