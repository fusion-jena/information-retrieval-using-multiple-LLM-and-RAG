I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a model or determining when training is complete. The context appears to be discussing the validation of an Apis-FIS model, which is a fuzzy inference system used to predict the suitability of different factors for bee habitats. The validation process involves comparing the model's predictions with field estimations, but it does not provide information about the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
