I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to tree species identification using remote sensing and machine learning techniques. None of the references or citations provided include a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
