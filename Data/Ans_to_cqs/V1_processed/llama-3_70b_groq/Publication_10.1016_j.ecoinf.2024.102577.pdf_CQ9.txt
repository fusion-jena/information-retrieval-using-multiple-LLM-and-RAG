I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article or paper that discusses the use of machine learning in sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. The context mentions various references and citations, but it does not mention specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
