The provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the software tools and libraries used, such as Python, fastai, R, sf, raster, ggplot2, rasterVis, cowplot, Shiny, Leaï¬‚et, and Plotly. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
