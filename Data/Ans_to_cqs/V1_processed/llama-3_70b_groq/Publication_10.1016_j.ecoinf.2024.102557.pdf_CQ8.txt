I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts related to ecology, conservation, and environmental science, with some mentions of machine learning and deep learning. However, there is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
