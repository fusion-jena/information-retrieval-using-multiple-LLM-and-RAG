The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Precision, Recall, F1, GIoU, and mAP. These metrics are used to measure the model detection performance. Precision measures the accuracy of the model in making positive predictions, Recall measures the proportion of true objects that were detected, F1 is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, GIoU measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth, and mAP measures the average precision of the model in detecting objects.
