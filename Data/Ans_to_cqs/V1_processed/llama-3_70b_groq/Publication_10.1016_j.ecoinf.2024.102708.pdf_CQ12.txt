The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Specifically, the object detection models used are YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN), and variants of YOLOv5 such as YOLOv5 small, YOLOv5 medium, and TPH-YOLOv5, which is a modified variant of YOLO with a Transformer Prediction Head (TPH).
