The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers. This is explicitly stated in the context as "a combined architecture is proposed where by the CNN layer is embedded with the long short-term (LSTM) memory layer". This model is referred to as a CNN-LSTM model.
