The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework is used to build the model. However, it does mention several deep learning frameworks in a different context. In the first citation, the authors compare the performance of different deep learning frameworks, including Theano, Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow, and deeplearning4j. This suggests that these frameworks are being considered or used in some capacity, but it does not specify which one is used to build the model in question. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
