The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to perform end-to-end classification, learning features from an input dataset, and presenting increasing complexity through the layers of the network" in the provided context. Additionally, the context also mentions U-net, which is a type of CNN architecture, specifically designed for image segmentation tasks.
