I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, and machine learning algorithms, including random forests, support vector machines, decision trees, and artificial neural networks. While it mentions the use of vegetation index feature datasets, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
