Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors took measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model by splitting the data on the sticky plate level. This means that individual insects that belonged to the same sticky plate image were kept together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). This approach allows the model to be validated in a practice-oriented way, emulating how it will be used in real-world scenarios. 

However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability. The authors do mention that they avoided weak validation procedures like random data splitting, which suggests that they were aware of the importance of robust validation methods. 

It is also worth noting that the authors mention their previous research (Kalfas et al., 2021; Kalfas et al., 2022) where they showed that model performance can be highly overestimated when weak validation procedures are followed. This suggests that they have considered the importance of robust validation methods in their previous work, but the specific details of these methods are not mentioned in the provided context.
