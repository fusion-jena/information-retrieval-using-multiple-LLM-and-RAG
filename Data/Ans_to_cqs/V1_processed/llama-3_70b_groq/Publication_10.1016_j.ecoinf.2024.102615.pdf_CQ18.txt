The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the R value of the validation set is used as the performance indicator during the optimization process, and the goal is to maximize the R value using the grid search method. This implies that the model performance is evaluated on the validation set during the training process, and the hyperparameters are tuned to achieve the best performance on the validation set.
