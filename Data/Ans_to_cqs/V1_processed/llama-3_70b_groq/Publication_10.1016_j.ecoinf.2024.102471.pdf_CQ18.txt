The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using certain metrics during the fine-tuning phase.

In the fine-tuning phase, the model is trained on a labelled dataset to predict particular words or phonemes, and the performance is evaluated using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for the Automatic Speech Recognition task.

Additionally, during the evaluation of the proposed model, classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for each bird species with respect to different training-testing split ratios. This suggests that these metrics are used to monitor the model performance during training.

However, it is not clear what specific strategy is implemented to monitor the model performance during the pre-training phase.
