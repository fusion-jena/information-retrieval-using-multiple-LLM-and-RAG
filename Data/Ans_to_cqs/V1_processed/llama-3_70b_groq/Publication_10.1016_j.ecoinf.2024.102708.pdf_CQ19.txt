I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context only discusses the different object detection models used, including YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and their variants, but it does not provide information about the underlying frameworks used to implement these models.
