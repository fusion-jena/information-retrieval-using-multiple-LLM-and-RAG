The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. This is evident from the description of the model architecture, which consists of multiple dense layers with ReLu activation functions, batch normalization layers, and dropout layers. The model does not involve convolutional or recurrent layers, which are characteristic of CNN and RNN models, respectively. Additionally, there is no mention of self-attention mechanisms or encoder-decoder structures, which are typical of Transformer models. The focus on dense layers and batch normalization suggests that the model is a type of feedforward neural network, specifically an MLP.
