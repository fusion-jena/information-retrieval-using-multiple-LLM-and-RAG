Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning methods in bioacoustic classification tasks, but it does not delve into the specifics of data splitting criteria.

However, it is a common practice in machine learning to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets to evaluate the performance of the model. The typical split ratios are 60-70% for training, 15-20% for testing, and 15-20% for validation. But these ratios can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset size, and model complexity.

In the absence of specific information in the provided context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
