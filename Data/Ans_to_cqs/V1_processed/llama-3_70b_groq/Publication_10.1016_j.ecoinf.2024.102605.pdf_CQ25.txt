The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the 1D-CNN model, is for classification. It is used to construct a pest hazard class classification model, which identifies the degree of damage to forest trees by EJD (European Jumping Dwarf) in different months (June, August, and September). The model uses sensitive spectral vegetation indices as input and outputs a classification result indicating the level of damage.
