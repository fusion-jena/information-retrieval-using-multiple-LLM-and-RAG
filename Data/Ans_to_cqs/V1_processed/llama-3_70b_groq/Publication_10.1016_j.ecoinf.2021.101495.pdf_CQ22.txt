Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the training infrastructure, search strategy, and training duration for both neural networks, as well as the classification model's ability to learn with better accuracy when using data augmentation. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
