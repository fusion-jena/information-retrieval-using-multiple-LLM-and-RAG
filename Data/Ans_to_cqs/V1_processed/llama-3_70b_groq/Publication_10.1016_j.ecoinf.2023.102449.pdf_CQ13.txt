Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, including the use of residual networks, convolutional neural networks, and the encoder-decoder setup. It also discusses the pre-processing block, signal coarsening, and the output of the encoder. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
