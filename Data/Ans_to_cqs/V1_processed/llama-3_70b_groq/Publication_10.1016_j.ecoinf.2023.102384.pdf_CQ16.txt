Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context focuses on the data collection and curation phases, patch creation, augmentation strategies, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
