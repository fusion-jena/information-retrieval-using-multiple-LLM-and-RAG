I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be describing a package called "covsel" for species distribution modeling, and provides information about the functions and arguments available in the package. There is no mention of a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
