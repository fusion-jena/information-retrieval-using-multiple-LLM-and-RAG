The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are correct identification rate and processing time. The correct identification rate is used to measure the accuracy of the model in identifying species, and it is reported as a percentage. For example, in Challenge 1, the overall correct identification rate was 94.3%, and in Challenge 3, it was 94.1%. The processing time is also considered as a factor to find the optimum number of training steps. However, other common metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
