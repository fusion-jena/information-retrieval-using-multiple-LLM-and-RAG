Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in the deep learning pipeline is through images and videos acquired with drones. The context mentions that the study approached the problem of detecting and counting NBSB through images and videos acquired with drones. Additionally, it is mentioned that a public image dataset of NBSB in soybean fields was used, and a novel dataset with more images was added. There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for data collection. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary method of raw data collection is through drone-acquired images and videos.
