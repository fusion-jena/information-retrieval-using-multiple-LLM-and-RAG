I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, dropout, or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing species distribution modeling, kernel density, and model evaluation metrics such as AUC, TPR, TSS, and Kappa. It does not provide any information about deep learning pipelines or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
