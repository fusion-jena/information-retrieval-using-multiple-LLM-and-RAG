I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a repository where the deep learning pipeline code is available. The context appears to be a list of references and descriptions of various machine learning and deep learning models, but it does not include information about the availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
