Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image classification tasks, including the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. It provides details on the constitutive layers, tensor/vector shapes, and shapes of the input and output data. However, it does not discuss data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
