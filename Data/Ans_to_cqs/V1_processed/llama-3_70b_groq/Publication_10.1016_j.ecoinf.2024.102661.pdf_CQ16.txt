The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that the model undergoes a training process comprising 10,000 iterations, and during each iteration, the model logs the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values. However, it does not specify a stopping criterion such as validation loss plateau, convergence of the loss function, or a specific accuracy threshold. Therefore, it is unclear what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
