The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context mentions the use of machine learning and species distribution models, but it does not specify the framework used. 

Instead, it mentions the use of Weka (Frank et al., 2016) for implementing the CFS cross-validation and SUS. Weka is a machine learning software that provides a collection of algorithms for data mining tasks, but it is not typically used for building deep learning models. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) as one of the methods tried to build the classification model, which is a traditional machine learning algorithm, not a deep learning framework.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as the context does not provide information about the use of deep learning frameworks.
