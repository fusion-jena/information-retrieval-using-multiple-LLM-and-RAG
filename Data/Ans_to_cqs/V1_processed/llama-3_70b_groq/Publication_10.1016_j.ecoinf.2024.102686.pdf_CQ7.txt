The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to be focused on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for zoning and clustering, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
