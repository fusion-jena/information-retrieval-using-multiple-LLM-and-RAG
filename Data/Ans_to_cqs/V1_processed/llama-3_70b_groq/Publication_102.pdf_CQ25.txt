The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression, specifically count regression. The model is designed to predict the count of objects (e.g., elephants) in an image. The model takes an input image and produces an output density map, which is then used to estimate the count of objects by integrating the density distribution over the region. This is evident from the description of the UNet model, which is used to overcome potential information loss, and the Model-2, which uses an EfficientNet feature extractor to predict the count of objects.
