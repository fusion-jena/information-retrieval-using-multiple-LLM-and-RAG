Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the model's architecture, performance evaluation metrics, and training process, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
