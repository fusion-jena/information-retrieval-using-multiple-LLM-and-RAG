I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate, optimizer, or others. The context only mentions that a hyperparameter tuning methodology using grid search was employed to obtain the optimal values of various hyperparameters, but it does not specify what those hyperparameters are. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
