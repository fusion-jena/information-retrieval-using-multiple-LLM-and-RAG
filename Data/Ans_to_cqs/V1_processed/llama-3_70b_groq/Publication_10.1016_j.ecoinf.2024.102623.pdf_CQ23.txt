The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is designed to handle diverse datasets, which implies that the dataset used for training is diverse. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using multiple random seeds, which suggests that some form of cross-validation or random sampling is used to ensure the model's robustness. 

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these specific measures were taken.
