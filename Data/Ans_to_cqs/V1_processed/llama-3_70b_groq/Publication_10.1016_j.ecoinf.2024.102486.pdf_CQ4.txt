I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, particle filters, and parallel computing, with references to epidemiological models, animal audio classification, and state-space models. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision-related topics, which are typically associated with data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling.
