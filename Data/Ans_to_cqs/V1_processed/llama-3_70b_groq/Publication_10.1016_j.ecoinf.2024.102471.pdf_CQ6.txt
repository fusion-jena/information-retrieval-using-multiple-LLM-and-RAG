Based on the provided context, it appears that the preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model like Wav2vec is normalization. According to the text, "The waveform is normalized before passing through the convolutional layer..." This suggests that normalization is a preprocessing step applied to the audio data before it is fed into the feature encoder.

No other preprocessing steps like scaling or cleaning are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is possible that other preprocessing steps may be involved, but they are not mentioned in the given text.

It's worth noting that the context primarily focuses on the architecture and training objectives of the Wav2vec model, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of preprocessing steps. Therefore, it's possible that additional preprocessing steps may be necessary, but they are not discussed in the provided context.
