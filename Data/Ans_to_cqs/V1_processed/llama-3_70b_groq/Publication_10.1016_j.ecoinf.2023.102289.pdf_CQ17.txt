Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the LaDeco tool, its functionality, and the underlying models and technologies used, such as Deeplabv3 and Resnet269. It also discusses the importance of GPU for computational efficiency but does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
