The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data splitting, machine learning algorithms, and model evaluation. It discusses the splitting of data into training and testing datasets with an 80% and 20% ratio, respectively, but does not provide information on addressing data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are not discussed in the context.
