I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and text related to machine learning, river health, and ecological data, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
