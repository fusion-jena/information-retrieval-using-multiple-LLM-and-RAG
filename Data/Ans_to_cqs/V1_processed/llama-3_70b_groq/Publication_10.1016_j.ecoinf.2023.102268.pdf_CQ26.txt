The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the workflow of extracting features from spectrogram images using a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN, and then using a SVM classifier for classification. It also mentions splitting the labeled dataset into training and testing datasets (70/30) and holding out 50% of the training data for validation. However, it does not discuss any specific techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
