Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training parameters of the ResNet50V2 model, data augmentation, and validation strategies. It does not provide information on regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
