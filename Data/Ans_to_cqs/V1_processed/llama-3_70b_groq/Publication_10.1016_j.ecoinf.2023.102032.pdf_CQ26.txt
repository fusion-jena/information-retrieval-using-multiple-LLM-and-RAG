Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the use of Sentinel-2 data for wetland use intensity analysis in East Africa, and it mentions the robustness of the approach, but it does not provide specific information on data bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
