I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and results of a study on automated cataloging of oyster toadfish boatwhistle calls using template matching and machine learning, but it does not provide information on where the data or code is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
