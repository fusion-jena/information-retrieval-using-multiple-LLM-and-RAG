Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification of voice-recorded data, particularly mosquito sounds. It discusses the generation of spectrograms as a visual representation of sound data and the implementation of CNN models with various parameters. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
