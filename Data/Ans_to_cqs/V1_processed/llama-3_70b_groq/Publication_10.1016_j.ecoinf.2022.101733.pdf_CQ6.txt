Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, agriculture, and sample selection strategies, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it's worth noting that the context does mention the importance of carefully checking and correcting samples in the post-supervision step, which suggests that some form of data cleaning or quality control may be involved. Additionally, the context mentions the use of support vector machines (SVM) and morphological parameters, which may imply some form of feature scaling or normalization. However, these are indirect hints and do not provide a clear answer to the query.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
