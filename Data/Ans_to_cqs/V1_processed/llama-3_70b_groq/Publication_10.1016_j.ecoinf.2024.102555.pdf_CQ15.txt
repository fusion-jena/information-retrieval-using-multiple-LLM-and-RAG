I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to various research papers in the fields of hydrology, ecology, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
