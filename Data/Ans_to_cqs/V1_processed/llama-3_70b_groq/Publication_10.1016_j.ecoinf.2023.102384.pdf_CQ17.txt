Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation strategies, but it does not discuss regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
