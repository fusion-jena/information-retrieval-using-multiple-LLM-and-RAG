I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the study was partially funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and that a Microsoft Sponsorship supported Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org. However, it does not provide information about where the code repository is hosted. It is possible that the code is not publicly available or is hosted on a private repository.
