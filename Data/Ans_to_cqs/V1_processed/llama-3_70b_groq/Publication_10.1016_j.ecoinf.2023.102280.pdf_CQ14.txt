The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the methods are "manually tuned to maximise the evaluation metrics", but it does not provide further details on the optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization (e.g., grid search, random search).
