Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. 

In the text, it is mentioned that "The combined impact of this improvement in urban and mining accuracy led to an increase in the overall accuracy of the map from 84% to 91%." This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

Additionally, the text provides a table with various accuracy metrics, including overall accuracy, water accuracy, forest accuracy, bare soil accuracy, mining accuracy, and urban accuracy. For each of these categories, both producer accuracy and user accuracy are reported. For example, "The CART LULC map showed overall accuracies of 84%, 86%, and 81% for 1997, 2009, and 2019, respectively... The average overall accuracy across all years was 84%, with the highest accuracies coming from the water (99% producer accuracy, 94% user accuracy) and forest classes (100% producer accuracy, 93% user accuracy)..."

There is no mention of precision, recall, or other evaluation metrics in the provided context.
