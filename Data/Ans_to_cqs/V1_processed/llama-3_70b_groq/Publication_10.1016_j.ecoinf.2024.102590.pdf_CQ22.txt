The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics of a deep learning model. The context discusses the use of a Random Forest classifier with GLCM texture metrics for land cover classification, and the evaluation metrics used are Overall accuracy, Producer's accuracy, and User's accuracy. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the Random Forest classification workflow.

There is a mention of deep learning methods, specifically CNN, in the context, but it is only mentioned as a potential methodology for future LULC analysis, and no evaluation metrics are specified for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not provided in the given context.
