Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for detecting alates on sorghum leaves and classifying pests. It discusses the splitting ratio of the dataset, characteristics of deep learning models, and the potential of CNNs in automating tasks in entomology.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data consists of images, as the context mentions the input resolution of the images and the use of CNNs for image processing. It is likely that the images were collected through some form of visual observation or imaging technology, but the specific method is not mentioned.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit information on the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
