The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only discusses the process of determining the structure and hyperparameters of the model by assessing the effectiveness of validation data forecasts. The context focuses on the selection of the solver for training the network and the input time series length, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
