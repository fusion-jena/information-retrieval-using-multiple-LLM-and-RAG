I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the development of novel deep learning models for fish detection in turbid waters, the creation of a weakly-labeled fish dataset, and the use of transfer learning and ensemble techniques to improve model accuracy. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is hosted.
