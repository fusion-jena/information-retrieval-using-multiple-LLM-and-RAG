I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or splitting data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to a study on soil degradation and land-use types, and it discusses data collection, factors affecting soil degradation, and limitations of the study. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning models, and therefore, it is not possible to determine the criteria used to split the data for model training.
