According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is a ratio of 1:9 for the training set and test set, respectively. This is mentioned in Section IV, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION, where it is stated that "we split the labeled pixels of UAV hyperspectral image into the training set and test set with the ratio 1:9." This means that 10% of the labeled pixels are used for training the model, and 90% are used for testing its performance. There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context.
