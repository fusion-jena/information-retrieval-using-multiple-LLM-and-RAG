I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context only discusses the data collection, preparation, and validation process for a random forest classification model, but it does not provide information on the deployment of the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
