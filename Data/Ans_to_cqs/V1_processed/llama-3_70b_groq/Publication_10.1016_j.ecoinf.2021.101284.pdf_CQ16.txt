I don't know. The provided context does not mention training or validation loss plateau, which are typically concepts related to machine learning model training. The context appears to be discussing data preprocessing and analysis, specifically standardization of data, and later mentions COVID-19 data and population classification. There is no mention of training or criteria for determining when training is complete.
