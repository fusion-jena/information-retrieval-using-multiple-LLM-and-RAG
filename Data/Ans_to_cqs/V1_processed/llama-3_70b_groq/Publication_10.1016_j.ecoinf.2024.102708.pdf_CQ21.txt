The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention that "result metrics were calculated using Padilla et al. (2021) for each DL model" and that a positive detection is identified when the Intersection over Union is greater than 0.5. This suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved.

Additionally, the context provides tables with metrics such as F-score, Precision, Recall, and their corresponding standard errors and confidence intervals. This implies that these metrics were calculated as part of the postprocessing steps.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these were involved in the postprocessing steps.

In summary, based on the provided context, metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training, but it is unclear whether saliency maps or confusion matrices were used.
