Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text discusses the training process, including the loss function used (mean scaled absolute error), batch size, input image resolution, and learning rate, but it does not specify when to stop training. 

Common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, validation accuracy threshold, or a maximum number of epochs. However, these are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this case.
