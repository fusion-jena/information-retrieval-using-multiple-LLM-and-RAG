According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the CNN-based models are precision, recall, and F1-measure. These metrics are calculated using the following equations:

Precision = True positives / (True positives + False positives)
Recall = True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
F1-measure = 2 × Precision × Recall / (Precision + Recall)

These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in classifying tree cover classes. The F1-measure provides a balance between precision and recall, and a higher F1-measure indicates better model performance.
