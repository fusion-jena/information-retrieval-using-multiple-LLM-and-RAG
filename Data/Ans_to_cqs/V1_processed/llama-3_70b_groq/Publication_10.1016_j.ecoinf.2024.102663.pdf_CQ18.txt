I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different regression models, including their training and prediction times, variance, R2 scores, and Mean Absolute Errors (MAE). It does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
