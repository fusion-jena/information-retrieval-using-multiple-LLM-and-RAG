The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of learning and loss curves to diagnose the learning performance of the models over time. These curves provide insights into how the model is learning and generalizing. 

It can be inferred that the training process might be stopped when the validation accuracy curve reaches a plateau or when the validation loss curve starts to increase, indicating overfitting. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Therefore, the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified in the given context.
