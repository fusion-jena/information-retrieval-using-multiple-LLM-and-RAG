Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The text mentions datasets such as PlantClef2015, MS COCO, Places2, and LeafSnap, which are all image datasets. The context also discusses feature extraction and visualization techniques specifically designed for images, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and feature maps.

There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. The focus is solely on image classification and feature learning using CNNs. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
