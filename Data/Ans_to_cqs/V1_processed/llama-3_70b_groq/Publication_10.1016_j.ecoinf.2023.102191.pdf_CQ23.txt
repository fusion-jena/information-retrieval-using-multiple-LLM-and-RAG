I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing a monitoring program for the dive community, using a mobile app to collect data on marine taxa, and conducting a trial to test the viability of the program. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning models, datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
