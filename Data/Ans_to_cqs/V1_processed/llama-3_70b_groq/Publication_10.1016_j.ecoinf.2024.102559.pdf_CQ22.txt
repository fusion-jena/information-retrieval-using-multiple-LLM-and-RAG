The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it appears to be discussing the evaluation of classification models for iceplant and other vegetation classification. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models include:

* Overall Accuracy
* Producer's Accuracy
* User's Accuracy
* True Positives (TP)
* True Negatives (TN)
* False Positives (FP)
* False Negatives (FN)

These metrics are commonly used in classification problems to evaluate the performance of models. However, precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It is possible that these metrics may be calculated from the provided values, but they are not directly mentioned.
