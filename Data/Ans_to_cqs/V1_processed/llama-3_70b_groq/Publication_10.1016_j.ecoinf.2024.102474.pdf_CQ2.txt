The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "video prediction" and "guided video prediction task" in the context, it can be inferred that video data is likely used in the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions "datacubes" which are often used to represent 3D or 4D data such as satellite or climate data. Therefore, it is possible that the data format used is a 3D or 4D array-like structure. However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to determine the exact data format used in the pipeline.
