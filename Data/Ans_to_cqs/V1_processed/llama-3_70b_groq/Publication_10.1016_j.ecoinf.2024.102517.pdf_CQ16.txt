Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the audio classification loss network, the noise reduction network, and the calculation of the loss function. It also provides some experimental results in terms of SNR and Î”SNR values, but it does not discuss the training process or the criteria for determining its completion.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It is possible that the authors of the study used a validation loss plateau or another criterion to determine when training is complete, but this information is not mentioned in the given context.
