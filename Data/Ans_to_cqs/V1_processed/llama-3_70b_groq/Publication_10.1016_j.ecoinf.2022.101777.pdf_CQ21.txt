I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to image classification, remote sensing, and training data requirements, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
