The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only mentions "neural networks" as a potential method to distinguish between minima and maxima in a rainbow color palette, but it does not provide further details on the implementation or the frameworks used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
