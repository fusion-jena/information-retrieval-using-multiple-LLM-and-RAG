I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and characteristics of different deep learning models, such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetv2, and InceptionV3, and their potential applications in developing a traceability model. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
