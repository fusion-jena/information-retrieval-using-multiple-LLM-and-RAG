Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The text mentions "raw bivalve images" being used as inputs to the pre-trained networks, and the architectures mentioned (EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, and InceptionV3) are all convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are typically used for image classification tasks. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
