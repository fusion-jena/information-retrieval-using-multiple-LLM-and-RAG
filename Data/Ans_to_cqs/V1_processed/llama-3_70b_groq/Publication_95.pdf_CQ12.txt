The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of "deep convolutional neural network" in the first paragraph and the use of ResNet50V2 models in the training procedure described in section 5.1.1. ResNet50V2 is a variant of the ResNet architecture, which is a type of CNN.
