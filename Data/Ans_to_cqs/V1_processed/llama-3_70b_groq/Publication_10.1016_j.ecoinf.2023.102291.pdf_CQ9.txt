I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that supplementary data can be found online at a specific DOI (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102291), but it does not specify the repository where the data is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the exact repository where the data is available.
