Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on image classification algorithms, object detection methods, and datasets related to pest species identification. It discusses various techniques, such as YOLOv3, YOLOv5, and CSPNet, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
