Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to data analysis of vocalizations, providing a table with the number of tracked vocalizations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole data set. There is no mention of deep learning models, normalization, scaling, cleaning, or any other preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
