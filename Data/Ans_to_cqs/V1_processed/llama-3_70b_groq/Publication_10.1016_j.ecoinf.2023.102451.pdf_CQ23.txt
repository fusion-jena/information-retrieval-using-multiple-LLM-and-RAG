Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It only mentions that the performance of the model on the test set demonstrates how well the model can generalize, but it does not provide details on how this generalizability was achieved. It is possible that the dataset used, EMDS-6, is diverse and representative of the problem domain, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting being used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
