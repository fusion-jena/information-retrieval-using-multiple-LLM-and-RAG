Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology and architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, its performance evaluation, and comparison with the BIOCLIM model. It does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
