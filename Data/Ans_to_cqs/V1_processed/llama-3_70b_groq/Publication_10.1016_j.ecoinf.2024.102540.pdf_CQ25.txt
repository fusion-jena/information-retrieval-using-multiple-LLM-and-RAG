The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, is object detection. These models are designed to detect objects in images, which is a key component of the monitoring process in entomology. The YOLO models are single-stage detector models that can accurately detect objects in images, making them useful for tasks such as species detection and classification.

In the context of entomology, the purpose of deep learning models like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) is to identify species, classify, and detect pests in images. This can aid or even replace humans in key scouting activities, such as manual identification and counting, by automating these tasks using imagery.

Overall, the purpose of deep learning models in this context is to automate tasks related to object detection, classification, and identification, which can expedite the monitoring process and reduce the need for manual labor and time.
