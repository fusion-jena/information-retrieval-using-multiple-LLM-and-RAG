Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different classifiers, including SVM and deep learning models like VGG-19, ResNet-50, and others, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
