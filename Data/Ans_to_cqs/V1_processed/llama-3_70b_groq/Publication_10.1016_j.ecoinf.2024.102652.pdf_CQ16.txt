According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is an early stopping function that halts the learning process if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. This is mentioned in the training process section (2.6.3), which states that "The 100 epochs are used with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs." This implies that the training process is considered complete when the model's accuracy plateaus and does not improve for 20 consecutive epochs.
