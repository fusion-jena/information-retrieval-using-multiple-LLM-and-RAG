Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is instance segmentation. This is evident from the fact that the analysts annotate each fish by delineating and assigning each fish to a class, resulting in 975 individual fishes (segments) from 100 images. This suggests that the annotation process involves segmenting each fish instance from the rest of the image, which is a characteristic of instance segmentation. There is no mention of bounding box annotation or any other annotation technique in the provided context.
