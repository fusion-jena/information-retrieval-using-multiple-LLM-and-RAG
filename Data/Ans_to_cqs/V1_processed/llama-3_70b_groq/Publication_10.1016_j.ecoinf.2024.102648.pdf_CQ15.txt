Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting CLCuD (Cotton Leaf Curl Disease) incidence, but it does not provide details about the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
