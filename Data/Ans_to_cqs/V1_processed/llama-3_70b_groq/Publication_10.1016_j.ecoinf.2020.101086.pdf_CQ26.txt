The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on species distribution models and addressing sampling bias in the context of ecological data. 

However, it does mention four approaches to transforming model input data to address sampling bias, categorized by the dataset concerned with the transformation (presence sites or background sites) and the implementation space of the transformation (geographical or environmental space). These approaches aim to modify the distribution of the presence dataset to tend towards a uniform distribution or build the background set according to a selection bias that reflects the same sampling bias.

It does not mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
