Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the training process, performance evaluation, and results, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for training.

However, based on common practices in machine learning, it is likely that the training process was stopped when the model's performance on the validation set plateaued or reached a desired level of accuracy. This is a common approach to avoid overfitting and to ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.

In this case, the context mentions that the training process took around 10 hours on the CPU and reached an accuracy of 95% on 140 epochs. It is possible that the training was stopped after 140 epochs because the model's performance on the validation set had plateaued or reached a desired level of accuracy. However, this is only an inference, and the actual stopping criteria used are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
