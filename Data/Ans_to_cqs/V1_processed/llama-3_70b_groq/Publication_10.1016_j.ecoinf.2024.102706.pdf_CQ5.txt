The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on vegetation indices, forest canopy cover, and machine learning approaches for predicting canopy cover from satellite images. It mentions the use of nadir photographs, L-band SAR data, and LiDAR data, but does not reference any of the commonly used deep learning datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
