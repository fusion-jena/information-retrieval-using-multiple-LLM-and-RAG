Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors and optical methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions the use of crop sensors, Google Glass, and thermal-RGB imaging systems for gathering in-field data on crops. Additionally, the context references the use of canopy reflectance indices and discriminant analysis to evaluate wheat nitrogen status, suggesting that remote sensing methods may also be employed for data collection.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of a SPAD-502Plus device, which is a handheld chlorophyll meter that measures the chlorophyll content of leaves. This device is likely used to collect raw data on plant chlorophyll content.

It does not appear that surveys or public datasets are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, based on the provided context. The focus seems to be on using sensors and optical methods to collect data directly from crops.
