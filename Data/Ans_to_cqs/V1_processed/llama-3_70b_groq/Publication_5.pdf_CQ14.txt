The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using an iterative grid search parameter tuning method. This is mentioned in the context as "After iterative grid search parameter tuning, using a small subset of our data, 5 hidden layers (𝐇𝑗,𝑗=1,2,⋯,5) were used, and the number of neurons (n) in..."
