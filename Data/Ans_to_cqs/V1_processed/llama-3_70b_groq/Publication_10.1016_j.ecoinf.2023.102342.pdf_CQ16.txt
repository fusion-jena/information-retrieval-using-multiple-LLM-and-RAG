I don't know.

The provided context does not mention training or validation loss plateau, which are concepts typically related to machine learning model training. The context appears to be discussing the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, data mining, and association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm. It does not provide information about determining when training is complete or any criteria related to validation loss plateau. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
