The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that images have been processed through the use of the DL model coupled with human manual interpretation steps, referred to as the Semi-Automated Deep Learning (SADL) model. It does not provide details on how the images were annotated for training the DL model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
