Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-Score are calculated to evaluate the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net model on unseen test sets of the datasets (mentioned in section 3.4.f).

There is no mention of postprocessing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix. It is possible that these steps may be part of the overall workflow, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
