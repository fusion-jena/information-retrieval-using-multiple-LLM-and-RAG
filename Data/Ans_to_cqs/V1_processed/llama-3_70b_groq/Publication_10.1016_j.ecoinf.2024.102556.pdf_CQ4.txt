Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the Res2Net module, its application in the Deep SORT algorithm, and its advantages in feature extraction. It also references various papers and conferences related to computer vision and object detection, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
