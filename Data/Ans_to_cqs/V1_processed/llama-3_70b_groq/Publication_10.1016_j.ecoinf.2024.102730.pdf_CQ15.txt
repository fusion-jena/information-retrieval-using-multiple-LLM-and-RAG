According to the provided context, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Adam. This is mentioned in Table 2, which displays the optimal values for the three different regression tasks. The solver for weight optimization is listed as "adam" for all three tasks. There is no mention of SGD or any other optimization techniques being used in the pipeline.
