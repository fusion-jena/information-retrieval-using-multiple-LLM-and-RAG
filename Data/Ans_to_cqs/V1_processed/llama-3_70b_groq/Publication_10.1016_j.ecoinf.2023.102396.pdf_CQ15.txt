I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique used for comparing and aligning time series data. It explains how DTW works, including the calculation of the accumulative cost matrix and the search for the least cost path. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
