I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. It discusses the MI's metadata repository, known as the Data Catalogue, which is operated through Drupal and has a custom module called IFBA for storing datasets related to fish scales and otoliths. It also mentions the FAIR data principles and various existing standards, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
