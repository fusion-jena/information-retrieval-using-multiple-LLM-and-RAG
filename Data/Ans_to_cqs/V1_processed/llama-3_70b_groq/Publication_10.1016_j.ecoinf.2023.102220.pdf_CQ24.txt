The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on comparing the performance of the PBP method with other machine learning algorithms, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and discussing the implementation of the PBP method.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of random noise terms in the Ricker recurrence equation, which is a mathematical model used to simulate population dynamics. In this context, the random noise terms are drawn from a normal distribution, and if the addition of the random noise term yields a negative population size, a new random noise value is drawn until a positive population size is obtained. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of handling randomness in their modeling approach, but it does not provide insight into strategies employed in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common strategy to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, as it ensures reproducibility of results. However, this is not mentioned in the provided context.
