The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on water quality and dissolved organic matter in lakes and rivers. It describes field sampling and sample collection methods, including the use of clean polyethylene bags, Whatman GF/C and GF/F filters, and 0.2 Î¼m Millipore filters to collect and prepare water samples for analysis. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
