Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through remote sensing using Landsat images. The study utilizes Google Earth Engine, which is a platform that provides access to a large repository of remote sensing data, including Landsat images. The context does not mention surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data. It is likely that the Landsat images are used as the primary source of data for training and testing the deep learning models.
