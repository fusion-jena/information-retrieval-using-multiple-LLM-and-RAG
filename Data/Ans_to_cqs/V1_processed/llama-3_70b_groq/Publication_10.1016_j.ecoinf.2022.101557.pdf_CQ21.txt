The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does describe the post-processing steps involved in transforming the result of the CNN into an easily accessible GIS resource.

The post-processing steps mentioned in the context are:

1. Rounding the pixel predictions from the CNN, where predictions with a value larger than 0.5 are considered wetlands and those below are non-wetlands.
2. Converting the raster representation into a vector representation to minimize storage space and make it easier to distribute.

These steps are primarily done to produce and refine the material covering southern Sweden and make it easily accessible for further analyses.
