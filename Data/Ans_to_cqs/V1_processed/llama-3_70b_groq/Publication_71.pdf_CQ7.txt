Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ and discusses the challenges of incorporating a NIR band in addition to RGB bands in the model. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without specific information about the dataset and model in question, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used for data splitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
