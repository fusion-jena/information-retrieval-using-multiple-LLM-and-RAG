The purpose of the machine learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mention of predicting WQI (Water Quality Index) and using WQPs (Water Quality Parameters) as inputs, it can be inferred that the model is likely used for regression or prediction tasks, specifically to predict the Water Quality Index.
