I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and data processing techniques, but it does not discuss deep learning or annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
