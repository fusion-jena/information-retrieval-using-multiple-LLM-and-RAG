Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of various metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

The context mentions the calculation of top-1, top-2, top-3, top-4, and top-5 accuracy, as well as macro recall and macro precision. These metrics are likely calculated after model training to evaluate the performance of the models.

Additionally, the context mentions a confusion matrix, specifically for the InceptionV3 model, which shows the number of test images for each prediction. This suggests that the creation of a confusion matrix is another postprocessing step involved after model training.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether these steps are involved or not.
