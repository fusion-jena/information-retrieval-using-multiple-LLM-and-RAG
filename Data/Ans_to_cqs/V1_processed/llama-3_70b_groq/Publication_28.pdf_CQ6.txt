The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the VAE model includes a series of operations such as pre-processing, EfficientNet based feature extraction, IKHO based parameter optimization, and VAE based classification. 

Although the context does not provide specific details about the preprocessing steps, it implies that some form of preprocessing is involved before training the VAE model. However, the exact steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
