Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy. The text states that "The accuracy obtained reaches 95% on 140 epochs" and "the proposed CNN-LSTM performs better in classifying plant species than the conventional CNN as it attains the accuracy of 95.06%". There is no mention of precision, recall, or other evaluation metrics. Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context.
