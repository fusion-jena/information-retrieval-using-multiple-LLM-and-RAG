The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the BERT model, is for text classification. This is evident from the context, which mentions "long document classification" and "classification tasks" multiple times. The model is being used to classify web articles and social media posts based on certain criteria, such as the presence of bat-related or exploitation-related terms. The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated based on its performance on this classification task.
