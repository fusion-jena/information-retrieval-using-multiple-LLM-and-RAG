Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+ and the challenges of incorporating a NIR band into the model. It discusses the need for significant GPU power and larger batch sizes for efficient model training, as well as the requirement to adjust the DeepLabV3+ architecture to accommodate four-channel input images. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
