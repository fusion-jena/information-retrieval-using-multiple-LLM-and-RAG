The purpose of the machine learning models (not deep learning models) in this study is to predict species distribution. The models are used to generate a species distribution model, which is then used as input data for the IFM-LCONS (Integrated Framework for Metapopulation-Landscape Connectivity Analysis). The models analyze environmental variables and species data to predict the likelihood of species occurrence in a given area. The goal is to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution and to identify areas with high landscape connectivity, which is essential for species conservation.
