Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing is keeping the integrity of events during data splitting. This means that all images of an event are put into the same dataset to prevent poor generalization of the DCNN model. This is specifically mentioned in the context of the SS and LSM datasets, which are camera trap image datasets where images within the same event are significantly similar to each other.

There is no mention of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing in this specific deep learning pipeline.
