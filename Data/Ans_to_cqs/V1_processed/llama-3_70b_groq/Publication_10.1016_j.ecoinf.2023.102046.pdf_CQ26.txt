The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention that dataset imbalance was dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function. This suggests that the authors used class weighting as a technique to handle class imbalance in the dataset, but it does not provide information on other techniques that may have been used to address data bias during preprocessing.
