The context mentions that the deep learning model was tested separately in 30 forest plots situated in the northern Italian Alps, in 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein (Germany), and successively in all the 130 plots through a cross-validation analysis. This suggests that cross-validation was used to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting. The model was trained on Sentinel-2 optical images, but it is not clear if the dataset was diverse in terms of geographical location, forest type, or other factors. Therefore, it can be concluded that cross-validation was used to ensure generalizability, but it is unclear if other measures such as diverse dataset or stratified splitting were taken.
