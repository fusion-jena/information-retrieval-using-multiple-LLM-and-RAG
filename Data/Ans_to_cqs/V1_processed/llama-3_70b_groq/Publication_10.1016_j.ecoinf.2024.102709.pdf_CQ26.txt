The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model's performance, dataset description, and the tools used for image preprocessing and model building. 

However, it can be inferred that the ideal train-test split was used, which resulted in an accuracy of 97.3% when applying the model to images of the extracted clusters from the color recognition. This suggests that the split was done in a way that minimized bias, but the exact technique used is not specified.

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
