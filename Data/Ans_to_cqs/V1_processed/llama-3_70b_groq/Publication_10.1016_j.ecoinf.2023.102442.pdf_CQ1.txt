Based on the provided context, it appears that satellite imagery is a primary method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is mentioned as a cloud processing platform that provides a public catalog containing petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. This suggests that satellite imagery from GEE is used as input data for the deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 based multispectral data for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana, which further supports the idea that satellite imagery is a key data source.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets (other than satellite imagery) being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it can be inferred that satellite imagery is the primary method for collecting raw data in this context.
