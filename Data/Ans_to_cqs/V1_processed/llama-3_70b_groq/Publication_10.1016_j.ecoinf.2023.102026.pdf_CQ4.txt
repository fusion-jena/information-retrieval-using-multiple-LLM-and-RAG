The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text discusses scaling hypotheses in the context of ecological informatics and species distribution models (SDMs), but it does not relate to data augmentation techniques in deep learning. 

The text mentions resampling techniques, specifically bootstrapping, which is a method for estimating the variability of a model's performance, but it is not a data augmentation technique. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
