I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer. The context discusses Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, including logistic regression and generalized additive models (GAM), as well as random forest, but it does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model based on the provided context.
