The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on spatial sampling methods and their applications in thematic map evaluation, rather than deep learning pipelines.

However, it can be inferred that the context is related to spatial data, and the methods mentioned are related to sampling strategies for collecting data in a spatial context. The context mentions stratified sampling, simple random sampling, systematic random sampling, and clustered sampling methods.

It does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or the specific methods used for collecting raw data in such pipelines. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct answer to the query based on the provided context.

If you are looking for information on methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, you may need to refer to other sources that specifically focus on deep learning and data collection methods.
