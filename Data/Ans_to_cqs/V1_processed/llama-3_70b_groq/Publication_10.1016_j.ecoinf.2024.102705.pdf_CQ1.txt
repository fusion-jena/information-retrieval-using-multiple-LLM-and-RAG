Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Camera traps are described as a popular, non-invasive, and cost-effective method for gathering observational data on wildlife. They are used to capture images of wild animals in their natural habitats, which can then be used to train deep learning models for tasks such as image processing and species identification.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the context whether surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data. However, it is mentioned that camera trap images are passively captured in any environment where wild animals may appear, which suggests that camera traps are the primary method of data collection in this context.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information on whether the camera trap images are used as-is or if they are combined with other data sources, such as surveys or sensors, to train the deep learning models.
