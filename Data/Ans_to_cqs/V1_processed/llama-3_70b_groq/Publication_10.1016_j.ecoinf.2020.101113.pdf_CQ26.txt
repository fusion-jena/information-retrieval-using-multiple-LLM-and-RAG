The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a potential method to increase the training data size for rare species, which could help mitigate data bias. Additionally, the context notes that previous studies have found data augmentation to significantly improve performance, but it is unclear if this was used in the current study.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these techniques were used or not.

In summary, the only technique mentioned in the context that could potentially address data bias is data augmentation, but it is unclear if it was actually used in the study.
