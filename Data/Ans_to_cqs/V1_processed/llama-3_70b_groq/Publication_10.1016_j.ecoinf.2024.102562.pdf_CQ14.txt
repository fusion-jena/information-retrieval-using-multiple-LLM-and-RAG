I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It provides information about the model's performance on different benchmarks, the minimum detection confidence scores, and the IoU threshold used. It also mentions various research papers and experiments related to image analysis and deep learning, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I cannot determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
