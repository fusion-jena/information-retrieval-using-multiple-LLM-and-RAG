I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, specifically decision tree-based models, and their application to remote sensing and geospatial data. It discusses tuning parameters such as 'numberOfTrees', 'minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and 'seed' to prevent overfitting, but it does not mention deep learning or regularization methods specific to deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
