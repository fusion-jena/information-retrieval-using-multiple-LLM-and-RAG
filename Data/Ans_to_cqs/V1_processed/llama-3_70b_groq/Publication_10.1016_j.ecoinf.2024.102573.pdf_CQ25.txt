The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is classification, specifically bird species recognition. The model is trained to classify bird species based on their vocalizations or audio recordings. The input to the model can be the raw waveform or a time-frequency representation of the audio signal, such as the Constant-Q Transform (CQT) or Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT). The model learns to extract relevant features from the input data and classify the bird species accordingly.
