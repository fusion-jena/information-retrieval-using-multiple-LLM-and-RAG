I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to machine learning, remote sensing, and land use/land cover classification, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
