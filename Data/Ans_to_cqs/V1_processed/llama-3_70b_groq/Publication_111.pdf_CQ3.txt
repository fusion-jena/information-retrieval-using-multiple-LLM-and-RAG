I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on predicting SST and SWH using machine learning, deep learning, and statistical models, and it discusses the architecture of the proposed GRU-DNN model and the methodology used. However, it does not provide information about data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
