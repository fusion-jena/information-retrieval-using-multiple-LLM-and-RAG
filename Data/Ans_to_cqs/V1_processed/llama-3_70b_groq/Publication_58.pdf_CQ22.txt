The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), User Accuracy (UA), and the F1-score. 

The Overall Accuracy (OA) is calculated by taking the sum of the diagonal of the confusion matrix. The Producer Accuracy (PA) is calculated by taking the number of well-ranked individuals divided by the sum of the column in the confusion matrix. The User Accuracy (UA) is calculated by taking the number of well-ranked individuals divided by the sum of the line. Finally, the F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which allows calculating the accuracy of a model by giving an equal importance between the PA and the UA.
