The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture of the proposed model, which follows a VGG style network, and mentions the use of Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10âˆ’4, and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. However, it does not specify any regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
