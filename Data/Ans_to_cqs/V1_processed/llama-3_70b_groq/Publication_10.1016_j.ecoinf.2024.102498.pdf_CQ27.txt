Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for LULC classification, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. It only discusses the training and validation process within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
