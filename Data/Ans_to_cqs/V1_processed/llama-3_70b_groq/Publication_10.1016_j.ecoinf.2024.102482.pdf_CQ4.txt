I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts related to various applications of deep learning in ecology and environmental science, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
