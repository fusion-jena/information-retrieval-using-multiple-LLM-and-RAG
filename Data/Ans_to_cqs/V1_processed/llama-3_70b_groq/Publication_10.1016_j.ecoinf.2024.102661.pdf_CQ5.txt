I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to forecast agricultural carbon emissions in China. It discusses the use of the Tree-structured Parzen estimator Bayesian optimization (TPEBO) algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in the pipeline.
