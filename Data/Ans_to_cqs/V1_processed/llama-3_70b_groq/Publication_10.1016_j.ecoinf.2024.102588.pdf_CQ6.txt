The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention batch normalization, which is a technique used to normalize the input data. Specifically, it calculates the mean and standard deviation of the batch normalization layer to avoid covariate shifts.

Other than batch normalization, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or feature engineering. It primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the deep learning models, including CNN, autoencoder, ANN, SVM, and RF.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that batch normalization is one of the preprocessing steps involved, but the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps.
