Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the model's architectural complexity, total parameters, and total layers, as well as the experimental setup and model performance evaluation. It also provides information about the EfficientNet and ResNet-50 models, but it does not provide details on the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
