Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model is built using TensorFlow. This is inferred from the mentions of TensorFlow-specific modules and functions, such as `tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16` and `tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet_v2.ResNet152V2`. Additionally, the context mentions `tfhub.dev` which is a TensorFlow hub for pre-trained models. There is no mention of PyTorch or any other deep learning framework.
