The provided context does not explicitly mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on bioacoustic classification, particularly in the context of marine mammals, and discusses the application of deep learning methods to this field.

However, it does mention that deep neural networks typically require significant sample sizes for all classes, and that there are tools to enhance data or combine disparate datasets. It also references a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning, but does not specify the datasets used in that survey.

Therefore, I don't know the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline in the context of bioacoustic classification, as this information is not provided in the given context.
