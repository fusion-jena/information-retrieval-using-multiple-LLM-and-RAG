According to the provided context, the performance of the cluster analysis function of Kaleidoscope (recognizer) is evaluated using two metrics: precision and recall rate. These metrics are commonly employed for assessing bird recognizer performance. Precision is estimated by dividing the number of true positives (Nighthawk vocalizations) by the total number of candidate sounds within the cluster “Nighthawk”. The recall rate is obtained by dividing the total number of true positives detected by Kaleidoscope by the total number of Nighthawk vocalization on the validation dataset. There is no mention of accuracy as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context.
