I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to biomass estimation, machine learning algorithms, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
