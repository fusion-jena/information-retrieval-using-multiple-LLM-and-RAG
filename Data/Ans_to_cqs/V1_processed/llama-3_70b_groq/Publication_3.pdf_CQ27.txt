I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the calibration of models for classification challenges, the results of the challenges, and the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
