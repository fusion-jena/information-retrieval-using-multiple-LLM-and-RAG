The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The model selection procedure is described, where the model with the highest performance on the validation data set (data partition Av) is selected and trained on the full training data (data partition Bt) for up to 30 epochs. However, it does not specify how the optimal number of epochs is determined. 

It is mentioned that validation data (data partition Bv) is used to determine the optimal number of epochs to train the selected candidate model, but the specific criteria used for this determination are not provided. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
