According to the provided context, the labeled dataset was split 70/30 into training and testing datasets. Additionally, 50% of the training data were held-out for validation. This implies that the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are:

* 70% of the data for training
* 30% of the data for testing
* 50% of the training data (which is 35% of the total data) for validation

This split allows for model selection and parameter optimization using the validation set, while the test set remains unseen during training to evaluate the final model's performance.
