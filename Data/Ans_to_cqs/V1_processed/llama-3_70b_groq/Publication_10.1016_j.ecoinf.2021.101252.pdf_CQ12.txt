The pipeline uses a combination of different deep learning models, including CNN, ResNet, InceptionTime, and LSTM. These models are used as candidate models in the AutoML procedure, where their architectures and hyperparameters are selected at random from a prespecified range of values. The specific details about the components and structure of each architecture are given in van Kuppevelt et al. (2020).
