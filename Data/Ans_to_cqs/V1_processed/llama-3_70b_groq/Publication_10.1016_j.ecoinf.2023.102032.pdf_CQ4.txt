I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article about using machine learning for cloud detection and wetland use intensity analysis in East Africa, and it provides information about the datasets used, spatial resolutions, acquisition periods, and other details. However, it does not mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
