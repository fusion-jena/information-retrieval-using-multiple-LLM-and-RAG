Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. AP (Average Precision): A higher AP value indicates improved accuracy across various object classes.
2. AP0.5: AP calculated at a 50% IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold.
3. AP0.5:0.95: AP calculated over an IoU range from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05.
4. mAP (mean Average Precision): The mean of all AP values.
5. FPS (Frames Per Second): Measures the model's speed, encompassing preprocessing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds, providing an overall assessment of the model's efficiency in real-time applications.
6. FLOPs (Floating-Point Operations Per Second): Quantifies the computational complexity of the model, calculated considering the convolutional kernel size, the number of input and output channels, and the feature map's height and width.
7. Parameter amount: The number of parameters in the model, calculated as k2.Cin.Cout.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, speed, and computational complexity.
