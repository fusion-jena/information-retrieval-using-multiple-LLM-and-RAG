I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model hyperparameters or their optimization. The text appears to be discussing the analysis of filamentous organisms, specifically the Rhizophagus irregularis fungus, and presents various visualizations and metrics for characterizing its morphology and network structure. There is no mention of a model or its hyperparameters, let alone how they are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
