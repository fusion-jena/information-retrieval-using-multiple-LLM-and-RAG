Based on the provided context, it appears that online shared videos are used as a method for collecting raw data. Specifically, videos containing wild bird species are used, with a wide range of species richness (from 1 to 106 species). This suggests that the data collection method involves extracting data from online videos.

It is not explicitly stated whether surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data. However, it is mentioned that methods based on questionnaires, surveys, or interviews may not reflect the benefits from ecosystems as well as other methods. This implies that surveys may not be the primary method used for collecting raw data in this context.

No mention is made of sensors or public datasets being used for data collection. Therefore, it can be concluded that online shared videos are the primary method used for collecting raw data, but the use of other methods cannot be ruled out entirely.
