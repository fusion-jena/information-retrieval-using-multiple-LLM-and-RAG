The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to log the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values during each iteration of the 10,000 iterations training process. This systematic recording aims to pinpoint the hyperparameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the calculations.
