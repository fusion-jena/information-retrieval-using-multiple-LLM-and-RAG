I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the optimization of machine learning models using Optuna and the performance of different algorithms, but it does not provide information about the data repository or a link to access the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
