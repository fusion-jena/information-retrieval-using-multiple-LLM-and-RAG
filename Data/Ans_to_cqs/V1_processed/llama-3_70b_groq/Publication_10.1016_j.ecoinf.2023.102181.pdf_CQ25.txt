The purpose of the machine learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as a deep learning model, but rather a bagging model for predicting soil classes in semi-arid landscapes. The model is used for classification, specifically to predict the value of the response over the full extent of the environmental data to produce maps of predicted distributions.
