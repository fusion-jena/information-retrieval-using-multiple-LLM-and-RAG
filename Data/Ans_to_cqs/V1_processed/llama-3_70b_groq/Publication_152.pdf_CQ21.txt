Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the methodology of collecting and preprocessing the image data, training the U-Net model, and achieving the results. It mentions the calculation of the F1 score and Jaccard index as performance metrics, but it does not elaborate on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
