The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a fully convolutional network (FCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. This is evident from the description of the network architecture, which mentions the use of 2D convolutions, batch normalization, and Leaky-ReLU activation functions. The encoder consists of 5 blocks, each with a convolutional layer followed by a residual block, which is a common pattern in CNN architectures. The decoder also uses transposed convolutional layers to upscale the feature maps. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
