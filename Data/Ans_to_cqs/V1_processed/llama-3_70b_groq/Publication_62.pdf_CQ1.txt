The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to digitized natural history collections, but it does not specify how the raw data is collected. It mentions that digitization efforts are being made to compile specimen data and images, but it does not provide details on the methods used for data collection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
