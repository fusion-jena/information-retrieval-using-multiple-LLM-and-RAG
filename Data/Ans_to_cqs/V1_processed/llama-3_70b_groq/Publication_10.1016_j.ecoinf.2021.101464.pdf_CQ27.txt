I don't know. The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on a random forest model, its parameter optimization, and its performance evaluation using metrics such as R2 and RMSE. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
