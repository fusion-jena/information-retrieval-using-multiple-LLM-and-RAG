The context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention "CPU mode", which suggests that the training was performed on a Central Processing Unit (CPU) rather than a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).
