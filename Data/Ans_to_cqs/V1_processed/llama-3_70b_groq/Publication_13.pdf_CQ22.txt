The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "target accuracy" and "classification error" which suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used. Additionally, it mentions "AccT" and "Î”Acc" in the context of between-datasets classification, which could be related to accuracy, but the exact meaning is not clear.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a scaled confusion matrix to visualize classification error, which implies that the model's performance is being evaluated in terms of its ability to correctly classify samples. However, it does not provide explicit information on the specific metrics used, such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, but the exact set of metrics used is not clear.
