The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the performance statistics of different models in predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps and the evaluation criteria used for machine learning models. However, it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
