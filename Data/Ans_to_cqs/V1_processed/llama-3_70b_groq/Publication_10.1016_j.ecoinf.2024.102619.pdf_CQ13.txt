The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (CNN) are:

* Batch size: 32 images
* Loss function: Cross-entropy loss
* Optimizer: Adam learning rate optimizer
* Initial learning rate: 1e-03 (which is automatically adjusted during training)

These hyperparameters were chosen based on preliminary work, which showed that common default parameters were suitable for the data. The Adam optimizer was chosen for its computational efficiency and ease of use. Additionally, early stopping was enabled to stop training when the validation error (loss) did not reduce for 10 epochs, which helped identify the suitable number of epochs for each dataset.
