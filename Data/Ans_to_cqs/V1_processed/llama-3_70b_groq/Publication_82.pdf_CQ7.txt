The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are the train-test set distributions. The paper mentions that the experiments were run across a whole range of train-test set splits, namely:

* 80% of the whole dataset used for training, and 20% for testing (80-20)
* 60% of the whole dataset used for training, and 40% for testing (60-40)
* 50% of the whole dataset used for training, and 50% for testing (50-50)
* 40% of the whole dataset used for training, and 60% for testing (40-60)
* 20% of the whole dataset used for training, and 80% for testing (20-80)

There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context. The experiments seem to only consider training and testing sets.
