I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, and it discusses various aspects of data collection, laboratory analyses, and remote sensing. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
