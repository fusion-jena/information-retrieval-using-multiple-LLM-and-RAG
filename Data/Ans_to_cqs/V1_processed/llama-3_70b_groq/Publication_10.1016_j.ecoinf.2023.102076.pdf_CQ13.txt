I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing steps, model selection, and experimental design. It discusses the use of BERT, a pre-trained language model, and its application to text classification tasks. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during the fine-tuning process.
