The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The paper focuses on the classification process, feature extraction, and experimentation results, but it does not discuss the postprocessing steps in detail.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that some form of metrics calculation is involved, as the paper reports the accuracy of the model in the experimentation results (Table II). But it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
