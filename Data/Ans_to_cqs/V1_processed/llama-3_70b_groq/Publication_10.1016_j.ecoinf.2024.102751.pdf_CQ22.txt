The query asks about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, the provided context does not mention a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) used for estimating soil moisture (VWC) on a reclaimed spoil heap.

The context provides the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the GAM model:

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 4.1%, which indicates that the prediction model deviates 4.1% from actual VWC.
2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 5.6%, which is slightly higher than MAE because it squares the errors before averaging, giving more weight to larger errors.
3. R-squared (R2): 0.49, which shows that the model explains 49% of the variance in the observed VWC values.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the GAM model, but not a deep learning model. If you are looking for metrics to evaluate a deep learning model, common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error, among others. However, these metrics are not mentioned in the provided context.
