The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be discussing image classification and segmentation in the context of ecological informatics, using tools like eCognition and ArcGIS. It mentions techniques like multi-resolution segmentation, multi-threshold segmentation, and the use of GLCM texture measures, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
