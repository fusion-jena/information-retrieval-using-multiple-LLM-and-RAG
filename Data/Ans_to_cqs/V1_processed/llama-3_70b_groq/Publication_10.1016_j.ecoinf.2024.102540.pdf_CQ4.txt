Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the splitting ratio of the dataset, the characteristics of the deep learning models, hyperparameters, and training aspects, as well as the evaluation metrics of the trained models. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
