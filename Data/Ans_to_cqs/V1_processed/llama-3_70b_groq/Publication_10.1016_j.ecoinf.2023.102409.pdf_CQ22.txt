According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Intersection over Union (IOU): determines the proportion of intersection to union between true labels and predicted values.
2. Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU): computes IOU for each category separately and then averages the results across all categories.
3. Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA): assesses the accuracy of pixel-level categorization by measuring the ratio of correctly categorized pixels to the total number of pixels.
4. Accuracy: represents the proportion of accurately predicted data points from the whole dataset.
5. Precision: ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better discrimination between negative samples.
6. Recall: ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better identification of positive samples.
7. F1 score: ranging from 0 to 1, reflects the model's robustness, with higher scores indicating better performance.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the context of semantic segmentation tasks.
