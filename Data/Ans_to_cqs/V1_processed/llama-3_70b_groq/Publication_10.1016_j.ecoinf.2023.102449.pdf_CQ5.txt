I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to describe a soundscape VAE (Variational Autoencoder) model architecture, discussing the encoder and decoder components, residual networks, and layer normalisation. However, it does not provide information about the datasets used to train or test the model.
