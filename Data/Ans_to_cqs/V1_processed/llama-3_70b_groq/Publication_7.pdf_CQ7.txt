Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the classification process, pre-processing, and results of the experiment, but it does not provide information about the data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
