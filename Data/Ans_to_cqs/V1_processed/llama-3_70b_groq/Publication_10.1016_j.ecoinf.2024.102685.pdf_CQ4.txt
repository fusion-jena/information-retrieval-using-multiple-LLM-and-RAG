The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the workflow for data acquisition, preparation, and setting up random forest (RF) models for seagrass species classification. It discusses the removal of non-vegetated and mixed pixels, the collection of field data, and the use of satellite images with coarse spatial resolution. There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
