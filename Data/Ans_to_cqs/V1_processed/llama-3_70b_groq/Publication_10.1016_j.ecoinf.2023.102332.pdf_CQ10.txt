I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a research study that uses the Wikiloc platform and word embedding techniques, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
