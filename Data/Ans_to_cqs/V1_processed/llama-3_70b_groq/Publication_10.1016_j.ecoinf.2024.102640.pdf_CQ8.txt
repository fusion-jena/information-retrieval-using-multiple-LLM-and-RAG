I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the GreenCam project, the SegFormer model, and its training process, but it does not provide information about where the code is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
