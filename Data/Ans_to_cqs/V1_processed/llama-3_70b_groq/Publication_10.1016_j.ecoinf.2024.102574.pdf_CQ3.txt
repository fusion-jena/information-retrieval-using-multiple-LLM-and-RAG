I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, LiDAR, and forestry, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision tasks, but they are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
