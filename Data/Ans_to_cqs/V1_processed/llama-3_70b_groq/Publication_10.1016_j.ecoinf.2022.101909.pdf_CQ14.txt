I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of mAP (mean Average Precision) as a metric to evaluate the model's performance, and the use of F1 score and its variations to find an optimal balance between precision and recall. It also mentions the use of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction and visualization, and the application of a deep neural network for passive acoustic monitoring of bird communities. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.
