Based on the provided context, it appears that bounding box annotation is one of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the mention of "bounding box instances" in the context, specifically in the description of the CropAndWeed dataset and the Eden Library. For example, the CropAndWeed dataset has 5,764 bounding box instances, and the Eden Library has 7,853 bounding box annotations (441 for crops and 7,442 for weeds). 

However, there is no explicit mention of instance segmentation as a data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that other annotation techniques may have been used, but they are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot confirm the use of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques beyond bounding box annotation.
