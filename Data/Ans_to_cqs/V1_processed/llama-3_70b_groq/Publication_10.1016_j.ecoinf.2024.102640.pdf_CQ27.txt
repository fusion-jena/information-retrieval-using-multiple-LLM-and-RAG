Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the training process, including the model architecture, training dataset, optimizer, and loss function. It also mentions that the model is trained on a server with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3090 GPU, but it does not provide information on how the model is deployed or serialized for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
