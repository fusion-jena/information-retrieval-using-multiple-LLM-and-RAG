The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context only mentions that the data were not divided into training and validation sets due to short time sequences, and instead, 5-fold cross-validation was used for model evaluation. The performance of the model was evaluated using RMSE and R2. However, it does not provide information on when to stop training based on certain criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
