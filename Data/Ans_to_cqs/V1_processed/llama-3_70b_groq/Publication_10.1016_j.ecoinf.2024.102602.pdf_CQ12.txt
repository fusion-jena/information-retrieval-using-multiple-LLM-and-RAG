The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the deep learning model. Specifically, six open-source CNNs were selected for the classification task: VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. Additionally, the object detection mode uses Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 and ResNet101 as the backbone networks.
