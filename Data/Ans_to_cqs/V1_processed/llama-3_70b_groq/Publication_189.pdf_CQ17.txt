Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to Mask R-CNN training and provides loss values for different components of the model, as well as references to various papers and tools related to computer vision and deep learning. However, it does not discuss regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
