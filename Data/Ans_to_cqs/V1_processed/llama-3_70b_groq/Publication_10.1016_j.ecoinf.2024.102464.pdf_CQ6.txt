The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context discusses the use of machine learning models for species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it does mention that a correlation analysis of the variables was conducted before model implementation to enhance the predictive performance of the model and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This suggests that some form of feature selection or engineering may have been performed, but the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
