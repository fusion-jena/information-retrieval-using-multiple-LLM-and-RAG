I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the architecture and performance of different deep learning models, including transformer-like models and CNN-like models, and provides tables comparing their performance on a specific dataset. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
