The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses model evaluation, including experiments to assess generalization among sites, and presents a sample evaluation plot. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

The context focuses on evaluating the performance of the models under different scenarios, including within-site, cross-site, and transfer-learning setups. It presents a visual evaluation plot (Fig. 6) that shows the predicted tree conditions, but it does not provide details on the postprocessing steps involved in generating this plot.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
