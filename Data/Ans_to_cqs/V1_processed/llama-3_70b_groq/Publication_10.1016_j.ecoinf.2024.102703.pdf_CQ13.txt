The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions the architecture of the neural network, including the number of layers, neurons, and maximum training times, as well as the training error. It does not provide information about the optimization algorithm or learning rate used to train the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
