Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning results, the architecture of the U-net model, and the evaluation metrics used. It does not provide information on the dataset used, whether it was diverse, or if cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey, which might have provided a representative dataset. But without explicit information, it is difficult to determine the measures taken to ensure generalizability.

In summary, the context does not provide sufficient information to answer this query, and it is unclear what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
