The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "data augmentation" in [27] as a technique used to improve the performance of a fine-tuned CNN model. Data augmentation can be seen as a way to address data bias by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset and making it more diverse.

Other than that, the context does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. It does mention that the dataset will be created from scratch and annotated for custom training in the proposed system, but it does not provide details on how data bias will be addressed during this process.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only mention data augmentation as a technique that might be related to addressing data bias, but I do not have enough information to provide a more comprehensive answer.
