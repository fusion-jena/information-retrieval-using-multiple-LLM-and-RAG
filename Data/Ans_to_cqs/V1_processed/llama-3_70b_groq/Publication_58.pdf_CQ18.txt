The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the validation set. The data is split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training, and the test set is used to compute the final confusion matrix and quality metrics. 

Additionally, the learning rate is adjusted every 20 epochs, which suggests that the model's performance is being monitored and adjusted accordingly. The learning rate is divided by 10 until it reaches 10^(-6), which is a common strategy to reduce the learning rate as the model converges. However, the specific metrics used to monitor the model's performance during training are not mentioned in the provided context.
