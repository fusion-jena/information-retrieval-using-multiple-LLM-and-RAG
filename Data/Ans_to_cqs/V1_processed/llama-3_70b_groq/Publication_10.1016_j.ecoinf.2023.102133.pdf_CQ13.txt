The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (Multi-Layer Perceptron or MLP) are:

* Solver (optimizer): Adam
* Number of neurons in the hidden layers: 10
* Regularization factor “alpha” (L2 penalty): 10
* Activation function: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
* Learning rate: constant

These hyperparameters were selected after comparing the performance scores of all possible combinations of hyperparameters using a grid search technique.
