The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to machine learning and image-based species identification, it can be inferred that image data formats might be used in some cases. Additionally, the mention of "high dimensional data" in the context of random forests suggests that CSV or other tabular data formats might also be used. However, there is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
