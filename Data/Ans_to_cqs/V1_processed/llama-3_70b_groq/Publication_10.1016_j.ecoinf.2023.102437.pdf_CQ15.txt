Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep neural networks (DNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) in environmental science, particularly in land cover/land use classification and ENSO forecasting. It also discusses the use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and Random Forest (RF) models. However, it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
