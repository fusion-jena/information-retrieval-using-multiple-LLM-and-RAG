Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the GreenCam system, its functionality, and the user study conducted to evaluate its performance. It discusses the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and R2 metric) for the EPDNet model, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
