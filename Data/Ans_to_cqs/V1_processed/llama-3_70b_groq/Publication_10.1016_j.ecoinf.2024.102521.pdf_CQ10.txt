I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context provides references to various research papers and articles related to deep learning and computer vision for ecological research, but it does not include a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not available in the provided context.
