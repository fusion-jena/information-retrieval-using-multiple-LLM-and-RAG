The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the implementation of the CNN classifier, the use of transfer learning, data augmentation, and dropout techniques to enhance model robustness. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
