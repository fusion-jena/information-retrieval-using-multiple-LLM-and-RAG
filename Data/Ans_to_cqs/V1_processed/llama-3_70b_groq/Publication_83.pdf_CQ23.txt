Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, the input features, and the classification performance. It does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
