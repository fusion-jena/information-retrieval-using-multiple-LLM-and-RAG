Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily related to time series data, particularly in the context of hydrology and environmental applications. There is no explicit mention of image, audio, or video data formats. 

However, it can be inferred that CSV (Comma Separated Values) files might be used, as the context mentions short-term streamflow forecasting, rainfall-runoff models, and signal classification, which often involve time series data stored in CSV files. Additionally, the context mentions wavelet transforms, Fourier transforms, and spectral analysis, which are commonly used in signal processing and time series analysis.

It is also possible that other data formats, such as numerical arrays or matrices, might be used in the deep learning pipeline, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
