The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The "Data availability" section only states that "Data will be made available on request", but it does not specify a particular repository where the data can be found. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the data is available on Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
