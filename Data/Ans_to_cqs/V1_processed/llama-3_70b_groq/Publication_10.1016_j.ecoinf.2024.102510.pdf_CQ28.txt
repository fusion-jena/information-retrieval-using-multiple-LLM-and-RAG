I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance comparison of different deep learning models, their architectures, and their accuracy in bird species recognition tasks. It does not provide information about the deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
