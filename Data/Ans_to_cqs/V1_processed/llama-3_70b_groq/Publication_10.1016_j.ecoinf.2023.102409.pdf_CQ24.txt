Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on image segmentation, fractional vegetation coverage, and ecological restoration in arid regions, with a emphasis on deep learning models like Unet, Pspnet, and Deeplabv3+. 

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to handle randomness by setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as random initialization of model weights, random shuffling of training data, and random dropout. By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers can ensure that their results are reproducible and comparable across different runs.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide specific information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
