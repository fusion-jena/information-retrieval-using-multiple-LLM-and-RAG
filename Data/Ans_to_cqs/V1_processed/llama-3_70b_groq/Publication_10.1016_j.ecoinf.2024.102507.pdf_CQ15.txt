Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context focuses on the overall process of data processing, model building, and training, but it does not provide specific details about the optimization techniques used.

However, it is mentioned that the deep learning parameters were automatically adjusted according to the set number of epochs during the training process. This suggests that some optimization technique was used, but the specific technique is not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
