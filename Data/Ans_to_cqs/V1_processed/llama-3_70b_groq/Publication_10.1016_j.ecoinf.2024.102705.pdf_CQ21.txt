The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the training protocol, data augmentation techniques, and evaluation metrics such as Average Precision (AP), but it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. 

However, it is common in deep learning model development to calculate evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, after training. These metrics can be calculated from the confusion matrix, which is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. Saliency maps, on the other hand, are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in predicting the output. 

In this case, the context does not provide enough information to determine if these specific postprocessing steps were involved.
