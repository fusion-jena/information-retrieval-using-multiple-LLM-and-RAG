I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the dataset used is a publicly available dataset of environmental microorganisms called EMDS-6, but it does not provide information about where the dataset or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
