Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context primarily focuses on the application of the BirdNET deep learning model for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations and the analysis of the results. It does not provide details on the deployment process of the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
