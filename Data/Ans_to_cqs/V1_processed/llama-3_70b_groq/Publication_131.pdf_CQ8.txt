I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. It discusses the structure of the CNN, the training process, and the cyber-physical system used for anuran call classification, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
