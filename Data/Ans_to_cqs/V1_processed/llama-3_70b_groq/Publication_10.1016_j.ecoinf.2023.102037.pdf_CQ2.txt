Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The context mentions "images" and "image classification" multiple times, and it also references specific image-related techniques such as object detection and image tiling. Additionally, the figure illustrations (Fig. 5) show images being processed and tiled for training and testing.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Similarly, there is no mention of CSV (Comma Separated Values) files being used, which are typically used for tabular data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer is that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
