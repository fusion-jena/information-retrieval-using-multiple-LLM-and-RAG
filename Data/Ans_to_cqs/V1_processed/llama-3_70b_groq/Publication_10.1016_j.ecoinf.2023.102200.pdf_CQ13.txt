I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context primarily focuses on the LiDAR data, its parameters, and its application in tree segmentation and classification tasks. It mentions various algorithms and techniques, such as BEV Faster R-CNN, marker-controlled watershed algorithm, and SLIC, but does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
