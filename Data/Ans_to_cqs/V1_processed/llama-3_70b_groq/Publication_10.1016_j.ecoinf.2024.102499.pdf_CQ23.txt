To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors took several measures. Firstly, they performed a 5-fold cross-validation, where they randomly selected 80% of their dataset (Videoclips) to train their model and 20% to test it. This helped to assess the robustness of their method. 

Secondly, instead of splitting directly images from the frame dataset, they split videos rather than images. This was done to ensure full independency between images of the training set and testing set, as images from the same videos were very alike, which could lead to a model with low generalization capacity.

These measures were taken to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a specific subset of the data and can generalize well to new, unseen data.
