The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the hyperparameters used for training, such as momentum, weight decay, gamma, and batch size. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm used, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
