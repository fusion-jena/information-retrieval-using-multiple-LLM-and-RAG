Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image-based, specifically LiDAR and UAV point clouds, as well as high-resolution RGB images. The context mentions the use of Pix4Dmapper software to process UAV photogrammetry images and generate high-resolution DOM, DSM, and DTM datasets. Additionally, the context mentions the use of hyperspectral data in one of the references (Qin et al., 2022). 

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV files are also not explicitly mentioned, but it is possible that they may be used as an intermediate format for storing or processing data, although this is not explicitly stated.

It's worth noting that the context is focused on remote sensing and geospatial applications, which often involve working with image and point cloud data. Therefore, it's likely that the deep learning pipeline is designed to process and analyze these types of data formats.
