I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or provide a link to a specific repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research article or paper discussing the use of machine learning and deep learning methods to estimate CO2 and water fluxes in a semi-arid model plantation. It provides information on the authors, affiliations, and references, but does not include any information about a code repository. Therefore, I am unable to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
