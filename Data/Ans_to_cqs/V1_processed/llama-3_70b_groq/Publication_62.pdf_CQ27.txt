I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image classification, the training datasets, and the importance of metadata curation for machine learning projects. It also provides information about the computational resources used and acknowledgments. However, it does not provide any information about model deployment, serialization, or platform selection.
