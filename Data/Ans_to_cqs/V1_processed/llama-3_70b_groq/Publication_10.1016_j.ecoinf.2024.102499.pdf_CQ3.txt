According to the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. The context states that the authors "annotated sharks and the 19 non-shark species present in the frames with bounding boxes." This indicates that the authors used bounding box annotation to label the objects of interest (sharks and non-shark species) in the images. There is no mention of instance segmentation or any other annotation techniques being used.
