The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using Random Forest and spectral indices, with discussions on dataset preparation, sampling strategies, and classification methodology. 

However, it can be inferred that the authors are aware of the importance of representative sampling, as they mention the need for at least 50 pixels per thematic class and the use of simplified random sampling to capture variability within each class. This suggests that the authors are attempting to ensure that their training data is diverse and representative of the classes of interest.

It is also worth noting that the authors do not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used in this specific context.

In summary, while the context does not provide direct information on techniques used to address data bias, it suggests that the authors are taking steps to ensure representative sampling and diversity in their training data.
