Based on the provided context, it appears that cross-validation was used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Specifically, it is mentioned in Section 2.2.5 that a k-fold (k = 5) cross-validated fine grid-search was performed on the training data to optimize the hyperparameters of the SVMs. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on multiple subsets of the data, which can help to prevent overfitting and improve generalizability. 

However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability. It is possible that these measures were taken, but it is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
