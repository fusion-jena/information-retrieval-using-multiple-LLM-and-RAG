Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of deep learning approaches in remote sensing, particularly in tree species classification, and presents a flowchart for identifying tree species using deep learning. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
