I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to a study on drought propagation and its relationship with land cover types, and it discusses the methodology used for model training, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
