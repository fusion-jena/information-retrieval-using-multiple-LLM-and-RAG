The provided context does not specifically mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of Random Forest (RF) modeling, which is a type of ensemble learning method. 

In the context of RF modeling, it is mentioned that the dataset was randomly divided into two subsets, with 75% of the data used for model training and 25% for testing. This suggests that some form of splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance. However, it does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting.

Additionally, the context highlights the robustness of RF algorithms to randomly receive training data from subsets and establish models with high predictive capacity. This implies that the RF model is resilient to data noise and can generalize well to new data. However, it does not provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
