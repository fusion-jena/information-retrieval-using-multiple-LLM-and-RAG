I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the development and evaluation of the model, including the active learning framework, CNN model development pipeline, and model evaluation. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
