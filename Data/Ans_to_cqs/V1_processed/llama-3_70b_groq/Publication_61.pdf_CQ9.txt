I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology for building a dataset for cactus recognition in aerial images, the performance of the proposed approach, and the potential for improvement. However, it does not provide information about where the dataset or the deep learning pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
