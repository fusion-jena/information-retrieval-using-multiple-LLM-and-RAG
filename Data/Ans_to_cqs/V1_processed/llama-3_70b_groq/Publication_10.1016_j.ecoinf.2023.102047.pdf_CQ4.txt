The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

1. Random cropping
2. Horizontal/vertical flipping
3. Image rotation
4. Image translation
5. Zooming
6. Brightness adjustment
7. Contrast adjustment
8. Hue and saturation adjustment
9. Gaussian noise
10. Random erasing

These techniques were applied to both models during training to increase the size and variability of the dataset, helping to avoid overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities.
