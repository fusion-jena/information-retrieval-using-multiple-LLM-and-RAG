The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only provides the values of the hyperparameters used for training each model, such as batch size, learning rate, optimizer, and loss function, as summarized in Table 2. However, it does not describe the process of hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
