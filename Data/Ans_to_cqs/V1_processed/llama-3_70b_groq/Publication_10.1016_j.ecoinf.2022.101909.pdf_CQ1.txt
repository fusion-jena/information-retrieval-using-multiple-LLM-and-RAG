Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development of a method for passive monitoring of bird communities using UMAP and a deep neural network, and it discusses the application of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with the ResNet50 model.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data might be in the form of audio recordings, as the context mentions the use of spectrograms and acoustic activity of bird species. Additionally, the mention of the BirdNet application, which allows for the identification of over 3000 bird species, suggests that audio recordings might be collected through mobile apps or other devices.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
