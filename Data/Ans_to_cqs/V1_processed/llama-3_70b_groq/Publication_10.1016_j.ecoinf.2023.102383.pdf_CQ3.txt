The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide an example of deer annotation in Fig. 10, where 72 deer in the left image are annotated by ImageLab as shown in the right image. This suggests that instance annotation or instance segmentation might be used, where each deer is annotated as a separate instance. 

However, it does not provide information on whether bounding box annotation is used or not. The context focuses more on the object detection model architecture and the challenges of detecting small objects in thermal images, rather than the annotation techniques used. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that bounding box annotation is used in this specific pipeline.
