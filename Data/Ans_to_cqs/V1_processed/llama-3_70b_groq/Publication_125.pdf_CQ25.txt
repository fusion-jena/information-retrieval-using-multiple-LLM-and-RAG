The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the context where it is mentioned that "a semantic segmentation is conducted using our previous works [51â€“53]" to obtain the dataset. Additionally, the dataset is divided into four classes - urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road - which further supports the idea that the model is intended for semantic segmentation.
