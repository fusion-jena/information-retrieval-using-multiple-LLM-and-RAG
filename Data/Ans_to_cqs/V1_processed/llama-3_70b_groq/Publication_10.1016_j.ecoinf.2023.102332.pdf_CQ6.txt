The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does provide some information on the preprocessing steps involved in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

In the context of text mining, the preprocessing steps mentioned include tokenization, lemmatization, and English stop words removal based on a predefined list of common English words. Additionally, the text data is translated into English using DeepL before preprocessing.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or cleaning steps that are typically involved in preprocessing data for deep learning models. These steps may be necessary to prepare the data for training a deep learning model, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context. If you are looking for information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I recommend consulting a more general resource on the topic.
