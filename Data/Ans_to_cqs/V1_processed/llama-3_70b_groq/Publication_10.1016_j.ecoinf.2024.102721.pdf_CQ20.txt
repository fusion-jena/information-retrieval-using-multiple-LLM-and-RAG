I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the structure of the LSTM model, Bayesian optimization, and scenario analysis of oasis NDVI, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
