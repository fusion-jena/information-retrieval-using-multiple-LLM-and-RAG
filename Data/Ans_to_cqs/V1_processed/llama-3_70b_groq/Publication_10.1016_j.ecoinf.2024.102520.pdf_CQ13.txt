I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be discussing geostatistical models, such as Gaussian, spherical, exponential, and linear models, and their performance metrics, including MAE, MSE, R2, and RMSE. There is no mention of deep learning or its associated hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
