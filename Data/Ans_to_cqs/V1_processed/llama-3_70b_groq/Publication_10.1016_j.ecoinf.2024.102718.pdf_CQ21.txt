The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the calculation of various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC during the training phase. It also mentions the use of callbacks such as ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping, which suggests that the model is being evaluated and saved based on its performance on the validation set.

Additionally, the context provides the definitions of various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which are typically calculated after model training. However, it does not mention the calculation of a confusion matrix or the generation of saliency maps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it is unclear whether saliency maps or confusion matrices are calculated as part of the postprocessing steps.
