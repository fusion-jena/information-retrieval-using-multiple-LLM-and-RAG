The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This is inferred from the mention of ResNet269, which is a 269-layer ResNet neural network, and Deeplabv3, which is a semantic segmentation algorithm developed by Google. Both of these models are variants of CNNs, commonly used for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
