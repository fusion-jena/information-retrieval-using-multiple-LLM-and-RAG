The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the experimental analysis, fine-tuning of pre-trained models, and hyperparameter optimization, but it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
