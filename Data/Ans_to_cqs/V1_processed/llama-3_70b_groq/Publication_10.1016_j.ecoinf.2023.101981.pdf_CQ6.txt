Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for detecting ungulate vocalizations, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
