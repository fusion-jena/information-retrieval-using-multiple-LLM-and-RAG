The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the calibration of models for classification challenges, the results of the classification tasks, and the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used. It discusses the optimum number of training steps, correct identification rates, and processing times, but does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
