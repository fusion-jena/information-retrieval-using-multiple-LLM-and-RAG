The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context, are random changes of RGB channels of the original images and random vertical and horizontal flips. The random changes for each RGB channel did not exceed 0.1 by absolute value and were applied simultaneously to all channels. Additionally, small random rotations were considered, but they did not improve the network performance, so they were not used in the final pipeline. There is no mention of scaling in the provided context.
