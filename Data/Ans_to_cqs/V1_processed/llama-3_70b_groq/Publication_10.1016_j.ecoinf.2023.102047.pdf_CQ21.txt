The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The methodology section (3. Methodology) only mentions the four steps involved in the proposed approach for H. ovalis detection, which are: dataset description, dataset processing and labelling, model training, and performance evaluation. However, it does not elaborate on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, as this information is not provided in the given context.
