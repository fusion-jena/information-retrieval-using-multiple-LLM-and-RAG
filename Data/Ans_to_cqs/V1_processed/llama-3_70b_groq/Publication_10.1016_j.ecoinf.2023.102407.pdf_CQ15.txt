I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses species distribution modeling, machine learning methods, and their applications, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning pipeline optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
