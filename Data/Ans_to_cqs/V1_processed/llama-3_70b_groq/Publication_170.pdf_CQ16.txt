The criteria used to determine when training is complete is when the loss rate of the model is less than a preset threshold ε (i.e., ε = 1.0 × 10^(-4)). This is mentioned in the context as the iteration termination condition of the model, which is the same in each round of training. There is no mention of validation loss plateau or any other criteria being used to determine when training is complete.
