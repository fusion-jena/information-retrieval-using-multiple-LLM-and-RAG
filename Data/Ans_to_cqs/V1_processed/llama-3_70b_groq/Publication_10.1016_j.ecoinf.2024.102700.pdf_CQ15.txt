I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text only mentions the use of deep learning strategies, specifically neural networks, in a few studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide details on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
