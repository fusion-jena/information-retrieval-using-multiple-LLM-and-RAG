I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where it can be found. The text discusses the approach and methodology used in the study, including the use of pre-training with additional acoustic reference data and fine-tuning with ROI data, but it does not provide any details about the code implementation or where it is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the code repository.
