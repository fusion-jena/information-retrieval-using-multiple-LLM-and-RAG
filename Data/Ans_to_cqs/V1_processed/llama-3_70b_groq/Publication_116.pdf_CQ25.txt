The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. This can be inferred from the context, particularly in the section "IV. EXPERIMENTS" where it is mentioned that the model is used for "imagenet classification" and "plant classification". Additionally, the context also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are commonly used for image classification tasks. The model is designed to learn discriminant visual features from raw image pixels to classify images into different categories.
