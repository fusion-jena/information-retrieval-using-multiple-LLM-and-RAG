The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are partially mentioned in the provided context. Specifically, it is mentioned that the model uses a SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer with a learning rate that is 10 times smaller than the initial learning rate. However, the initial learning rate is not specified. Additionally, the batch size is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that "small batch sizes improve models' generalization capability" and that "eight pictures are being provided to the model each time", which suggests that the batch size is 8. No other hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs, dropout rate, or regularization strength, are mentioned.
