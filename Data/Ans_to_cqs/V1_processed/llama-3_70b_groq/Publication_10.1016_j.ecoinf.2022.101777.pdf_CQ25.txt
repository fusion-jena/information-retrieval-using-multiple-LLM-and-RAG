The purpose of the Random Forest (RF) model is classification. The model is used to classify images, where each pixel is classified according to the majority vote of the decision trees. The RF model is trained on a dataset of 5000 samples and uses 500 trees to classify the images. The classification task involves categorizing complex regions with many categories, and the model is used for large-scale classification.
