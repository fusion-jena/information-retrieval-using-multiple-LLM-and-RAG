The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text discusses the model's capabilities, limitations, and potential improvements, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
