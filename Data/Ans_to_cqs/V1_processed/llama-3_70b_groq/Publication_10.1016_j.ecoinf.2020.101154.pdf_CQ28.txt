I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be discussing the tuning of hyperparameters for Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for some dataset, but it does not provide information about the deployment of these models. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
