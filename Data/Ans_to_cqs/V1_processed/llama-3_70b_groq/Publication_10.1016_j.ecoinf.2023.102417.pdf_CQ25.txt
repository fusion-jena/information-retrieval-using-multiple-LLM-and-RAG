The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation, which involves classifying every pixel of an image into a specific class or category. This is mentioned in the context as "pixel-wise classification is called semantic segmentation". The model is trained to achieve a suitable biocrust coverage estimation, which requires accurate classification of each pixel in the image.
