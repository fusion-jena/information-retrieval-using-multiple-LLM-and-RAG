Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily focuses on air quality, pollution, and related studies, with some mentions of machine learning models like LSTM, but it does not delve into the details of optimization techniques used in these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
