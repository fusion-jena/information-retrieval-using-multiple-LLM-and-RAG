The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of heavy augmentation for training the ResNet-101 network, which includes various image transformations such as multiply, linear contrast, sharpen, emboss, flip in horizontal and vertical directions, rotations, and affine transformation. These augmentations can be considered as a form of preprocessing to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's robustness.

However, it does not provide information on other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, it is unclear whether these steps were performed or not.
