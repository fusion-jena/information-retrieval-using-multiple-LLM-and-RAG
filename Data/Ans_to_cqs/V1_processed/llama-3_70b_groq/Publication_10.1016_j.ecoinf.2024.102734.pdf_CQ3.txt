The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset was automatically generated by an annotator, and each segment has been manually reviewed by a human. Additionally, it references a paper by Fallgren et al. (2019) titled "How to Annotate 100 Hours in 45 Minutes", which suggests that the annotation process is efficient and rapid. 

It can be inferred that the annotation technique used might be related to audio annotation, possibly involving labeling or categorizing audio segments as possum vocalizations or noise sources. However, the specific technique used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, is not mentioned in the provided context.
