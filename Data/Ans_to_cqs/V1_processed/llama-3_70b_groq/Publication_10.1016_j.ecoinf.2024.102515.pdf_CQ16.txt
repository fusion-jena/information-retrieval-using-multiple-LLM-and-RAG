The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the methodology used to collect and filter tweets for biodiversity observations and the limitations of the approach. It discusses the use of the Twitter API, the twarc2 library, and the filtering process, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
