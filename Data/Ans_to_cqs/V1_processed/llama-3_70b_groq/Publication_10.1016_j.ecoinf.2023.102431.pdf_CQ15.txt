I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The text appears to discuss a different type of analysis, involving feature extraction, predictor screening, and discriminant analysis, but it does not mention neural networks or deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
