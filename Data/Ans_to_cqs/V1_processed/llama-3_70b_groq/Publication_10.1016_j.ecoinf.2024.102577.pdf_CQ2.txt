I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article about sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, and it lists various variables and references related to fisheries oceanography and species distribution models. There is no mention of deep learning or data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
