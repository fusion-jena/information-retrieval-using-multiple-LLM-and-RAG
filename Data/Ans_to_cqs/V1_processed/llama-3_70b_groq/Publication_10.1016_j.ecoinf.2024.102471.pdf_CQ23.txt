Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training process of the Wav2Vec model, as well as its application to bird species classification. It does mention that the model has a general understanding of phonemes present in human speech and demonstrates good generalization ability in classifying bird species. However, it does not provide specific details on the measures taken to ensure generalizability.
