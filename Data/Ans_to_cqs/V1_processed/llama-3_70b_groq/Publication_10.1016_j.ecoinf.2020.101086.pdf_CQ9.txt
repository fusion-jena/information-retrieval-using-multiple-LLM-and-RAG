I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. It appears to be related to species distribution modeling and correcting sampling bias, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
