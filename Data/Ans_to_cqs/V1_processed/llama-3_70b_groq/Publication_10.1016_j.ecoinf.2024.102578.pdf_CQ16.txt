Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the performance metrics of the image quality model, the camera trap setup, and data collection. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Typically, in machine learning, the criteria used to determine when training is complete may include validation loss plateau, convergence of the model, or reaching a desired level of accuracy. However, this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
