Based on the provided context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically, it is used for automated monitoring of marine mammals and fish habitats through computer vision. The model is trained to discriminate between different belugas, which suggests that it is a classification task. Additionally, the use of a contrastive loss function and the goal of minimizing the distance between similar images (of the same beluga) while maximizing the distance between dissimilar images (of different belugas) further supports this conclusion.
