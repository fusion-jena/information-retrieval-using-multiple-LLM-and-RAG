Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep-learning enhanced fusion methods for improved NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study, as well as the evaluation metrics used to assess the accuracy of the predicted images. It does not provide information on the model's training process or the steps taken to ensure its generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
