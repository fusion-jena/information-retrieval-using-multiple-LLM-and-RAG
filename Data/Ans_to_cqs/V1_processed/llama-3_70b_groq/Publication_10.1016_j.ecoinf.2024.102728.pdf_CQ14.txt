I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The text appears to be discussing a methodology for classification and reclassification of thematic spectral classes, and it references various papers on unrelated topics such as wine production, ecosystem dynamics, and image processing. There is no mention of a model or its hyperparameters, let alone how they are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
