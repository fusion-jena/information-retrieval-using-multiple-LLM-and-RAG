The code repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the CNN-based architecture used is EfficientNet, and the implementation is available on GitHub through the link https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet. This link provides the implementation of EfficientNet, but it is not a custom repository for the specific deep learning pipeline used in this project.
