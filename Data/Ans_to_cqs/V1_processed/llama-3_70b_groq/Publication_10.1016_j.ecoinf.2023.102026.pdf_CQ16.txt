I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on evaluating the performance of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Random Forest algorithms using various metrics, including Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), Percent Correctly Classified (PCC), sensitivity, specificity, and True Skill Statistic (TSS). It also discusses the use of bootstrapping and random forest techniques, but it does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
