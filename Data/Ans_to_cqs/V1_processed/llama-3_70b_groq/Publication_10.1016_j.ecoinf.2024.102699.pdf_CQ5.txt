The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used is related to birdsong classification, as the context mentions classifying 397 different bird species. Additionally, the context references the DCASE challenge and the bird audio detection dataset (BAD), which suggests that these datasets might be used in the pipeline. However, it does not mention popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks.
