Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of remote sensing data from Sentinel-2, as mentioned in Fig. 2, which shows a Sentinel-2 false color composite image. Additionally, the study uses field plots with above-ground biomass values, suggesting that field measurements were also collected.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of the Global WD database, which was used to calculate WD values. This database is likely a public dataset. The study also utilizes SoilGrids250m, a global gridded soil information database based on machine learning, which is another public dataset.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for raw data collection in the provided context. However, it is possible that field measurements were collected using sensors or other equipment, but this is not explicitly stated.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline appear to involve the use of remote sensing data from Sentinel-2, field measurements, and public datasets such as the Global WD database and SoilGrids250m.
