Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is evident from Figure 2, which shows samples of training objects' bounding boxes, with icebergs in the top row and ships in the bottom row. Additionally, the text mentions that the initial objects are outlined as vectors in the given Sentinel-1 images and are converted into the darknet annotation format with text files containing information on the label class of objects and positions in the image. This suggests that the annotation technique used is bounding box annotation, where objects of interest (icebergs and ships) are annotated with bounding boxes to provide location and class information to the model.

There is no mention of instance segmentation as an annotation technique used in this pipeline.
