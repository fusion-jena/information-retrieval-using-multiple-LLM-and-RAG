The context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). However, it does mention that the utilized predictive models were implemented in the Python programming language version 3.8.5, and the deep learning model (i.e., GRU-DNN) implementation is performed using a custom model architecture. Therefore, it can be inferred that a Python-based deep learning framework is used, but the exact framework is not specified.
