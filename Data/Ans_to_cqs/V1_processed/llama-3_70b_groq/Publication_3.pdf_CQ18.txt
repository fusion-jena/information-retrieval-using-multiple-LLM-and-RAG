The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the leave-one-out cross-validation technique. This is mentioned in the context as "we used a leave-one-out cross validation technique (Molinaro et al. 2005) to evaluate model performance in Challenges 1, 3, and 4." This technique is used to evaluate the model's performance during training by leaving out one sample at a time and using the remaining samples to train the model.
