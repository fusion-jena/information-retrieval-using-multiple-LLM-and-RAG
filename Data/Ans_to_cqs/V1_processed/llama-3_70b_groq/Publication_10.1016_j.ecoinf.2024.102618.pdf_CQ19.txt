The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The text only discusses the different architectures used, such as EfficientNet, InceptionResNet, ResNet, and DenseNet, but does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
