I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be related to geographical analysis, vegetation indices, and spatial data analysis. It discusses the use of the kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) and the geographical detector (Geodetector) for analyzing vegetation growth and spatial patterns. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods, so I cannot provide an answer to the query.
