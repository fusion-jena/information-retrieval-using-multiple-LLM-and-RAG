Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. To Tensor: This step is mentioned in the context, which suggests that the data is converted into tensors before training the model.

2. Normalize: The context provides the mean and standard deviation values used for normalization, which are [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and [0.229, 0.224, 0.225], respectively.

Additionally, the context mentions data augmentation techniques, including:

1. Gaussian Noise
2. Speckle Noise
3. Random rotation with a degree of 30
4. Random changes in brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue with specified values.

These preprocessing steps are applied to the dataset before training the BEiT model. However, it does not mention any specific cleaning or scaling steps.
