I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a data repository or a specific platform where the data is stored. The text appears to be a research article discussing the use of machine learning methods, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF), to model net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The article presents the results of the models, including statistics and performance metrics, but it does not provide information about the data repository or where the data can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
