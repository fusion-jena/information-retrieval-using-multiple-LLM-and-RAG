The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset with a large number of samples (over 1.7 million samples in the Amazon database) and multiple tiles (15 tiles in the Amazon database and an unspecified number in the Cerrado database). This suggests that the dataset may be diverse, which could contribute to the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a validation set, which is typically used to evaluate the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting. This could be seen as a form of cross-validation, where the model is evaluated on a separate set of data not used for training. However, it is not clear if k-fold cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

Overall, while the context provides some hints about the dataset and validation process, it does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
