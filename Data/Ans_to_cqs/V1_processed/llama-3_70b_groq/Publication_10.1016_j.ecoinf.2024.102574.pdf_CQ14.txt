I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The text appears to be discussing the use of UAV-derived datasets to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) in a forest, and it presents various equations and results related to this task. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of a model were optimized, such as through grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
