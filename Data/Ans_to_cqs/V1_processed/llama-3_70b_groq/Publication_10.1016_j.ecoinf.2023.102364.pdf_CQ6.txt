Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research study on Short-billed Gulls using geographic information systems (GIS), machine learning ensemble predictions, and socio-economic data. It discusses the use of various datasets, feature importance, and model diagnostics, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of machine learning ensemble predictions, which may involve preprocessing steps such as feature scaling, normalization, or encoding categorical variables. Additionally, the context mentions the use of various datasets, including US Census data, which may require data cleaning and preprocessing before being used in a machine learning model.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, feature encoding, data augmentation, and handling missing values. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved in this particular study.
