I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be related to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and land use/land cover classification, with discussions on membership functions, pixel sizes, and data sources. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques, such as dropout or L2 regularization, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
