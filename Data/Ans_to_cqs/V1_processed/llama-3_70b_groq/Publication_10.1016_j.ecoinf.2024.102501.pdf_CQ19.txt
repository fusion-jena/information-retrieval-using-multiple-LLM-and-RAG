The context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. It only mentions that the programming language used is Python 3.7 (64-bit) and the integrated development environment is Anaconda 3. However, it does mention that the sklearn package is used for support vector regression, but it does not provide information about the deep learning framework used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
