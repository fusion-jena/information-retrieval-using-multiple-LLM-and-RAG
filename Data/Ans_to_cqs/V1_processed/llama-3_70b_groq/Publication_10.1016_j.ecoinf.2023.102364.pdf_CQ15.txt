The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to traditional machine learning algorithms, specifically ensemble methods like RandomForest, CART, and TreeNet, which are used for classification and regression tasks. These algorithms are not typically associated with deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
