I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or random seed values. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which involves setting parameters and controlling the complexity of queries. The method is used for analyzing climatic and dental variables, and the context provides examples of queries and how they are used to select localities that satisfy certain conditions. There is no mention of deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
