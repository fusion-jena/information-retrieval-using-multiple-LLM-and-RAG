I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It discusses various deep learning architectures such as RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and their applications in time-series prediction, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
