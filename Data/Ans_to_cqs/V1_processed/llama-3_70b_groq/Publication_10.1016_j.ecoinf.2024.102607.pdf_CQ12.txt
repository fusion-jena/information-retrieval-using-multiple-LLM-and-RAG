I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RFs), Decision Trees (DTs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping, but it does not specify the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The context also provides information about the feature variables of the satellite data, but it does not mention the type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
