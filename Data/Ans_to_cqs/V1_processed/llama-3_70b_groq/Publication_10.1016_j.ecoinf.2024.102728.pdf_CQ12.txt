Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Deep Convolutional Network (CNN). This is inferred from the paper by Cohen and Shashua (2017) titled "Inductive bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry", which suggests that the model is a type of CNN. Additionally, the paper by Mohedano et al. (2017) titled "Object retrieval with deep convolutional" also implies the use of a CNN. However, it is important to note that the context does not provide explicit information about the specific pipeline being referred to, so this answer is based on the available information and may not be definitive.
