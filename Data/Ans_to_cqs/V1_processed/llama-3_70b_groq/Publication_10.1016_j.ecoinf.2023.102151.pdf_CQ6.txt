Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to soil science, irrigation, and visualization, with references to various research papers and techniques. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

However, in general, common preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numerical features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming features to have similar magnitudes, often using techniques like standardization or feature scaling
* Feature selection: selecting a subset of relevant features to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance
* Data transformation: converting data types, handling categorical variables, and performing feature engineering

These steps are crucial to ensure that the model is trained on high-quality data and can learn meaningful patterns. However, without specific information about the deep learning model and the dataset being used, it is difficult to provide more detailed guidance on preprocessing steps.
