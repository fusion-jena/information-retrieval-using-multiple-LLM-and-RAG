I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training process of deep learning models for algal bloom forecasting, including the adjustment process of the solver for training the network and the input time series length for all models. It also mentions the division of collected data into training, validation, and testing sets, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
