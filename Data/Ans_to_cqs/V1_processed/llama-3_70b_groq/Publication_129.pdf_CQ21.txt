Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the agricultural pest recognition system, including the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer, fully connected layers, classification layer, and regressor branches. It also discusses the system's functionality, such as generating region proposals, calculating probabilities, and providing the IoU index.

However, it can be inferred that the system involves metrics calculation, as it mentions the IoU index, which is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of object detection models. Additionally, the context does not provide information about saliency maps or confusion matrices, which are common postprocessing steps in deep learning-based systems.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, as the context does not provide sufficient information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
