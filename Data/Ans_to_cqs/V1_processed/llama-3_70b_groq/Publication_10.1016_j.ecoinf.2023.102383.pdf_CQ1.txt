Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through drone thermal imagery. Specifically, the context mentions "deer survey from drone thermal imagery" and "UAV thermal image", suggesting that thermal images captured by drones are used as the raw data for the object detection task. 

However, it does not provide information on whether surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data. The context only focuses on the use of drone thermal imagery for deer survey and object detection. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to the query without additional information.
