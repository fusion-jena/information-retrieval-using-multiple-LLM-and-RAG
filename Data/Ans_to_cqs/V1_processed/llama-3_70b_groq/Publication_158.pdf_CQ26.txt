The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to enhance sample variation. The data augmentation techniques used include rotation, reflectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image. This suggests that the authors attempted to increase the diversity of the training data to mitigate potential biases. However, it does not provide information on other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. Therefore, it is unclear if these techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
