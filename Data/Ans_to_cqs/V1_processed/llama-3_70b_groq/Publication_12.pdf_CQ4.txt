The provided context does not explicitly mention traditional data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does describe a method to increase the number of images for rare species, which can be considered as a form of data augmentation. This method involves rescaling signals exponentially and shifting the window slightly either side of the call to change background noise. This approach helps to rebalance the representation of rare species in the dataset.
