I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The text appears to be discussing forestry and ecological informatics, and the equations and formulas provided are related to statistical estimation and sampling methods, not deep learning. There is no indication of a pipeline or any machine learning model being used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
