Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including data normalization and standardization, batch size, optimizer, learning ratio, and loss function. It does not provide information on how data bias is handled.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. It is possible that the authors may have addressed data bias in their preprocessing pipeline, but this information is not mentioned in the given text.
