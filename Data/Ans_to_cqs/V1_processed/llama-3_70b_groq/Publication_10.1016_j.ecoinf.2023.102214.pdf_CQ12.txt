Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text mentions "deep learning methods" and "deep convolution neural networks" in a reference to another study (El Abbadi, N.K., Alsaadi, E.M.T.A., 2020), but it does not specify the type of model used in the snow leopard identification pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
