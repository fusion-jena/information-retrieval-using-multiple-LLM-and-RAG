The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, BirdNET-Analyzer, are precision and recall. According to the text, the average recall was 29.7% ± 3.9 SE, and the average precision was 80.9% ± 3.8 SE. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to correctly identify bird species from their vocalizations. The precision and recall values are calculated for each species, and the confidence threshold is adjusted to achieve a balance between false positives and missed detections.
