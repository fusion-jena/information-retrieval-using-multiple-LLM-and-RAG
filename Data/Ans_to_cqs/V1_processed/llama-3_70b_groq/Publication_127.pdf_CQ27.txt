I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of research papers and conference proceedings related to deep learning, along with some tables comparing the performance of different deep learning architectures. There is no information about model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
