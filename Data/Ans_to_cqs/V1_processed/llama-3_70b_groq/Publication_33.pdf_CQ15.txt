Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), their application in species identification, and the concept of back-propagation for parameter optimization. 

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, which supports various optimization algorithms, including SGD and Adam. But without explicit mention, it is unclear which optimization technique is used in this specific pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
