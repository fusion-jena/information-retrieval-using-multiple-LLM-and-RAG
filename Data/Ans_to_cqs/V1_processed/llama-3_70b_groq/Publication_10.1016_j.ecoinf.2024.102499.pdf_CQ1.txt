Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS). This is mentioned in the conclusion section of the text, where it is stated that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective in extracting ecologically significant indicators from BRUVS. Additionally, the text mentions that the training data included 8 shark species and 19 non-shark species commonly associated with sharks on baited underwater videos, which suggests that the raw data is collected through video recordings. 

It is not clear from the provided context whether surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data. However, it is evident that video data from BRUVS is used as the primary source of raw data for the deep learning pipeline.
