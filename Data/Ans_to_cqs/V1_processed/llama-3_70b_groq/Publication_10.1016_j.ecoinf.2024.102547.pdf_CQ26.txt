The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on functional data analysis (FDA) and its applications in oceanography, rather than deep learning or data preprocessing techniques.

The context discusses dimension reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), and supervised and unsupervised methods that consider spatial dependencies within extensive datasets. It also mentions aggregated data modeling, empirical functional mean, and empirical covariance function. However, it does not mention techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
