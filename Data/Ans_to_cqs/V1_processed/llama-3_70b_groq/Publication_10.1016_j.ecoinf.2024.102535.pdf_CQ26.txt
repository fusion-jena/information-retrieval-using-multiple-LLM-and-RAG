The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the issue of class imbalance and its potential impact on the performance of the classifier. It states that if not considered explicitly in the training procedure, class imbalance can introduce undesirable bias that may affect the performance of the classifier.

Although the context does not specify the techniques used to address class imbalance, it implies that the authors of the text have taken steps to deal with this issue. Unfortunately, the details of these steps are not provided.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
