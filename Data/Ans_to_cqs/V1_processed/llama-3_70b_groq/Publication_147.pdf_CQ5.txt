The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the inputs used by the CNN model are a set of remote sensing features, including:

1. ARI
2. Band 2
3. Band 3
4. Band 4
5. DEM
6. NDVI
7. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)
8. Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI)
9. REIP
10. TPI
11. Topographic Roughness Index (TRI)
12. TWI
13. VBF
14. VH

These features are used to classify wetland areas in Alberta, Canada, and are not typical image classification datasets.
