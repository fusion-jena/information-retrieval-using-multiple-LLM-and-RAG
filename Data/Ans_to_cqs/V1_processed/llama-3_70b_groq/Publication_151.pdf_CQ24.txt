Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of DEPP on simulated data sets, training and parameter sensitivity, and placement of query sequences onto a reference tree. It discusses the training process, loss function, and hyperparameters like batch size, but it does not address randomness or random seed values. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
