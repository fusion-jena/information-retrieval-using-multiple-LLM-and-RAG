I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or specify the data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and earth system research, discussing data filtering, image collections, and spectral indices. It does not provide information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
