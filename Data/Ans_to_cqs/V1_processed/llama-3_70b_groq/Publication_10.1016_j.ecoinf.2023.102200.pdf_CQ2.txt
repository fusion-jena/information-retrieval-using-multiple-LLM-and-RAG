Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image-based. Specifically, the papers mention the use of:

* Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery
* Airborne LiDAR data
* Terrestrial LiDAR data
* Polarimetric SAR imagery
* UAV-LiDAR data
* BEV (Bird's Eye View) images

These data formats are used for various applications such as wetlands classification, mangrove crown diameter measurement, tree canopies segmentation, individual maize segmentation, and individual tree detection and extraction.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are not explicitly mentioned, but it is possible that they may be used as an intermediate format for storing and processing data.

It's worth noting that the context provided is focused on remote sensing and computer vision applications, which often rely on image-based data formats.
