Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only describes the architecture of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, including the number of neurons in each layer and the activation functions used. It does not provide information about the hyperparameters used for training the models.
