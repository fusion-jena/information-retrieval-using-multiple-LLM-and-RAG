The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It does not mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. 

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained and validated on separate datasets, as the context mentions training accuracy and validation F1-score separately. This suggests that some form of data splitting was used, but the specifics are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was prone to overfitting when using large architectures with many parameters, and that more training data was needed to mitigate this issue. This suggests that the dataset used may not have been sufficiently large or diverse to ensure generalizability.

Overall, without more information, it is difficult to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
