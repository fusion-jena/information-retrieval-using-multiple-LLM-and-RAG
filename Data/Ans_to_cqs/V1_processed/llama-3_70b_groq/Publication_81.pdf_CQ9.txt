I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the application of a novel deep learning method, called ESK model, for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. The context provides information about the methodology, results, and advantages of the ESK model, but it does not provide information about the data repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
