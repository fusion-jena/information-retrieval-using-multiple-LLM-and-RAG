The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. The models mentioned are LightGBM (LGBM), Gradient Boosting (GB), Decision Tree, and Random Forest (RF). These are all traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models.

The hyperparameters mentioned for these models are:

* For LGBM: max_depth, min_child_samples, subsamples, reg_lambda, n_estimators, learning_rate, and random_state.
* For GB: no specific hyperparameters are mentioned, but it is mentioned that the hyperparameter settings were carefully chosen to enhance the model's performance.
* For Decision Tree: maximum depth and minimum number of samples required to split a node.
* For RF: the number of trees was experimented with to find the optimal fit.

There is no mention of a deep learning model or its associated hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc.
