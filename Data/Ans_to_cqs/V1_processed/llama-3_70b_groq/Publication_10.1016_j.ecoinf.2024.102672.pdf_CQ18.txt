The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the loss curves during training. The text mentions that "the number of epochs was maintained in 500 as it proved to guarantee the stabilization of the loss curves during the training." This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored by tracking the loss curves, and the number of epochs is adjusted to ensure that the loss curves stabilize, indicating convergence of the model.
