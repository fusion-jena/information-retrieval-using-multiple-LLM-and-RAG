Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of machine learning methods, including random forest models, in various domains such as wastewater treatment, soil heat flux estimation, and remote sensing. However, it does not provide information about the data formats used in these applications.

The context does mention "remote sensing observations" and "data streams," which suggests that the data formats might include image or raster data, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the context cites papers that use machine learning methods for tasks such as detecting time-delay water quality indicators and estimating soil heat flux, but it does not provide details about the data formats used in these studies.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
