The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention some metrics that are related to speech quality and noise reduction, such as Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). These metrics might be used to evaluate the performance of the model, but it is not explicitly stated. 

It is also possible that the authors used other metrics that are not mentioned in the provided context. Without more information, it is not possible to determine the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
