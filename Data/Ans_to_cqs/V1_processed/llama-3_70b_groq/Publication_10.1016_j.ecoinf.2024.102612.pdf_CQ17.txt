Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics used, such as Mean IoU (MIoU), and the training process of the SoftGroup architecture. It also discusses the use of different kernel configurations and the number of convolutional layers and filters. However, it does not provide information on regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
