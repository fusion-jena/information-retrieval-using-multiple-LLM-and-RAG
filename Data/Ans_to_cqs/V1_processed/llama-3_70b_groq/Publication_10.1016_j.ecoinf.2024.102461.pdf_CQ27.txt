I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on the use of remote sensing data and various modeling techniques, including deep learning, for fire risk mapping in forest ecosystems. It discusses the methodology of fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a trained deep learning model.
