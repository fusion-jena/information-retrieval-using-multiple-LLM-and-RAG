Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does mention that "small values of sampsize were selected to improve computational performance, but large values of ntree were used to obtain models with stable classification results". This suggests that the hyperparameters sampsize and ntree were tuned, but it does not specify the method used for optimization (e.g., grid search, random search). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
