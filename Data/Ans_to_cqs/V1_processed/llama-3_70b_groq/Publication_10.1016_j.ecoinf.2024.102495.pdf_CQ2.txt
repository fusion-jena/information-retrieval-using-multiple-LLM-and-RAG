The context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "voice feature extraction" and "sound data" in the context, it can be inferred that audio data is likely used in the pipeline. Additionally, the context discusses the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is commonly used for image and signal processing tasks. However, there is no explicit mention of image or video data formats. It is also possible that CSV files may be used for storing or processing the extracted features, but this is not explicitly stated.
