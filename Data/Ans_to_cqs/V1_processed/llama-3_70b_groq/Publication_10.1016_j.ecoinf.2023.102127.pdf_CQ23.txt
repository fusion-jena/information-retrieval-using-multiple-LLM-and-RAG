The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of model evaluation in the context of species distribution modeling, highlighting the importance of considering all available data, dealing with biases and sampling methods, and accounting for environmental and niche parameters.

It does mention that withholding parts of the training data for validation can lead to both training and testing data suffering from the same spatial and environmental biases. However, it does not provide information on specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to this query.
