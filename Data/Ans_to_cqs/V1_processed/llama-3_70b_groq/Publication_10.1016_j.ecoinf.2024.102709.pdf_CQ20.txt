The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it does mention that the training time was taken on a Lenovo Legion Y520 with a Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon Edition operating system. This suggests that the training was likely done on a laptop with a CPU, but it does not provide information about the presence or use of specialized hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I don't know the exact hardware resources used for training the model.
