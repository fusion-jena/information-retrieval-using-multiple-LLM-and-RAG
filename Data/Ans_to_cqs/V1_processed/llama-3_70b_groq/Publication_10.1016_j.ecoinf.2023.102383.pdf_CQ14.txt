Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the feature map selection criterion, the definition of the bounding box regression, and the value of Î», but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization method used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
