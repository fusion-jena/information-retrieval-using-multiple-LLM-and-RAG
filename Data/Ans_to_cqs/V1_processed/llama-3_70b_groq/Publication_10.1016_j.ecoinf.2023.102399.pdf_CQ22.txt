Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Estimated accuracy (%): This metric is used to evaluate the proportion of correctly identified instances.
2. Estimated efficiency (/min): This metric is used to evaluate the speed or efficiency of the model in processing images.
3. Estimated weight (g): This metric is used to evaluate the model's ability to estimate the weight of fish.
4. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE, g): This metric is used to evaluate the difference between the predicted and actual weights of fish.
5. Mean Relative Error (MRE, %): This metric is used to evaluate the average relative difference between the predicted and actual weights of fish.
6. R2: This metric is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model.

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, such as DL-YOLO and YOLOv5n, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for fully automatic biomass estimation.
