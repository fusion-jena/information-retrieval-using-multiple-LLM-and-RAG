According to the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the STARdbi pipeline is through sampling flying insects with sticky traps, which are then covered with transparent acetate sheets. The traps are then scanned at high resolution using an office scanner, and the scanned images are uploaded to the STARdbi database along with their metadata (such as time of placement and removal, location, scanning resolution, etc.). This method allows for the collection of raw data in the form of images of insects, which can then be used for automatic detection and analysis using machine learning models.
