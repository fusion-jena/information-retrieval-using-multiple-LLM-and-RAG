Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and testing of the model using synthetic and real MS point clouds, as well as the discussion on the importance of data augmentation and the potential of deep learning models in fuel model retrieval. It does not provide information on the deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
