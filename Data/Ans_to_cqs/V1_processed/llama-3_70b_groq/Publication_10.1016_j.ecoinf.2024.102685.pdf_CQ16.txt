The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the statistical analysis using random forest classification, including the selection of the number of trees, the Gini Index for best split selection, and the use of repeated cross-validations to select the number of variables used for each node. It also discusses the evaluation metrics used, such as overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy.

However, it can be inferred that the training process involves repeated cross-validations with a specified number of folds and repetitions to select the optimal model parameters. The context does not provide information on when to stop the training process or what criteria to use to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
