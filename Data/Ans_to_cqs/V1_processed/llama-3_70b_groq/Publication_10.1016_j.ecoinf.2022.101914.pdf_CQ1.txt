The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the subsetting of background points, training individual models, and ensemble models. It discusses the approach used to select background points, the spatial blocking technique for dividing the study area into blocks, and the use of internal cross-validation during model training. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected in the first place. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
