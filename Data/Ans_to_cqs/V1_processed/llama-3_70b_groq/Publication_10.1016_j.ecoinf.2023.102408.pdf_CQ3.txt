I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be discussing artificial neural networks (ANNs) and random forests (RF) for modeling complex phenomena and developing nonlinear regression, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
