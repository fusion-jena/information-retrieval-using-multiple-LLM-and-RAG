Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is object annotation, specifically pixel-wise classification or semantic segmentation. This is evident from the mention of the COCO dataset, which has 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. The context also mentions that the model is used for semantic segmentation to locate and delineate artificial and natural objects in photos.

There is no explicit mention of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the object annotations in the COCO dataset might include bounding box information, as it is a common practice in object detection tasks. But this is not explicitly stated in the context.

It's worth noting that the focus of the context is on semantic segmentation, which involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, rather than bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to refine the object boundaries and capture fine details also suggests that the annotation technique used is pixel-wise classification or semantic segmentation.
