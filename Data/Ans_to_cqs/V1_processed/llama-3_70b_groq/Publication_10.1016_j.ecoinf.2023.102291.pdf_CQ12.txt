The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the text, which mentions a "customised CNN" and a pre-trained ResNet152V2 architecture, which is also a type of CNN. The architecture of the customised CNN is described in detail, including the number of convolutional layers, kernel size, activation functions, and other components.
