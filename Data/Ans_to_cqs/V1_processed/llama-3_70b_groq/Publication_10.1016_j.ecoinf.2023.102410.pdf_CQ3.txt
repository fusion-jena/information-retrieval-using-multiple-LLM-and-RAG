I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research paper on ecological informatics, and it discusses song structures and vocalizations, but it does not provide any information about deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
