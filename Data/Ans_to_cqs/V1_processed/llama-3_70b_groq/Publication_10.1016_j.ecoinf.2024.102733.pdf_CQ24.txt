The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of dropout as a regularization technique, which can help reduce overfitting and introduce randomness in the model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of noise scaling (cnoise(Ïƒ)) in the ODE solver, which could be related to handling randomness. 

However, it does not provide a clear answer to the question of how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in this context.
