I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the use of satellite images, machine learning techniques, and cloud computing for land use and land cover classification, forest fire detection, and carbon emission quantification. It discusses the use of Sentinel-2 satellite photos, cloud platforms, and Google Drive for data storage, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
