Based on the provided context, it appears that L2 regularization is used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. This is inferred from the presence of "Regularization_coefficient" and "kernel_parameter" in the context, which are typical hyperparameters used in L2 regularization. However, there is no explicit mention of dropout as a regularization method in the provided context. It is possible that other regularization methods may be used, but they are not specified.
