I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the concept of transfer learning, its application in predicting GDP using carbon emission data, and the proposed methodology of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL). It does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
