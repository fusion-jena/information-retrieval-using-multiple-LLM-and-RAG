I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various deep learning techniques and algorithms for object detection and feature extraction, but it does not provide information about a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
