Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing step involved after model training is the calculation of SHAP values. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a technique used to explain the output of a machine learning model. It assigns a value to each feature for a specific prediction, indicating its contribution to the outcome.

The context does not explicitly mention saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix as postprocessing steps. However, it does describe the calculation of SHAP values, which can be used to identify the most salient predictor, revealing the variables that significantly influence the model's inferential capacity.

The SHAP values are calculated using the Shapley values formula, which compares the prediction with and without each feature, averaging over all possible subsets. This allows for the identification of the most important features contributing to the model's predictions.

It is possible that other postprocessing steps, such as metrics calculation or confusion matrix, may be involved, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
