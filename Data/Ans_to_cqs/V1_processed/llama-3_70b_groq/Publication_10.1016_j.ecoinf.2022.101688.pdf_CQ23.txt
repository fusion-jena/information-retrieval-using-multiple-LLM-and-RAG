Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the input size of the CNNs, the characteristics of the vocalisations, and the comparison of different network architectures and dataset configurations. It does mention that the results are averaged across 13 unique executions, but it does not provide further information on how these executions were performed or if they were used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
