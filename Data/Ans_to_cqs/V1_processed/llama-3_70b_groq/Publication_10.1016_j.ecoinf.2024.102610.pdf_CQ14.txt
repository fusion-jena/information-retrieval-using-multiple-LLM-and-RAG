I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the importance of selecting appropriate parameters for model tuning, the use of variable elimination methods such as RFE and VSURF, and the evaluation of their impact on model performance. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
