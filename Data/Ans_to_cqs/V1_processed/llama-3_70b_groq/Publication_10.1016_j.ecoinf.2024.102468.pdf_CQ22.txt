The performance of the proposed WT-HMM is evaluated using accuracy and F1-score metrics. Additionally, precision and recall are also used to provide more insights into the model's performance. 

Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's detection and classification by calculating the ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances. Precision focuses on the correctness of positive detections and classifications and helps evaluate the model's ability to avoid false positives. Recall measures the proportion of true positive detections and classifications among the actual positive instances in the dataset. 

The F1-score provides a balanced measure of the model's performance, considering both precision and recall. A higher F1-score (close to 1) indicates better model performance, while a low F1-score (close to 0) suggests that the model may struggle to accurately classify positive instances and/or may miss a significant number of positive instances.
