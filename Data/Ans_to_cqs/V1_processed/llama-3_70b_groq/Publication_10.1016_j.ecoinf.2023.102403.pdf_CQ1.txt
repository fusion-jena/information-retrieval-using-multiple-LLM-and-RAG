The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the analysis of existing datasets, specifically GBIF and OBIS repositories, and the refinement of these datasets to enhance their quality and reliability. 

It does not provide information on the methods used to collect the raw data in the first place. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
