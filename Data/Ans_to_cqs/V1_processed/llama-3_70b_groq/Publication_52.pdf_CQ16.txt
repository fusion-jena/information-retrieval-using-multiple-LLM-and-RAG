Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the advantages of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and their application to Big Data analysis, as well as the performance metrics of different classifiers on various datasets. It also mentions the use of 10-fold cross-validation to obtain performance indices, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
