The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context only discusses the implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) for SPAD value modeling, but it does not provide details on the regularization techniques used. 

In fact, the context mentions that the addition of any hidden layers to the ANN returned less accuracy of the prediction on the test data due to overfitting, but it does not specify how overfitting was addressed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
