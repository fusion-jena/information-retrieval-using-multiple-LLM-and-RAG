The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors have used a diverse dataset for training, as they have mentioned "cross-season weed detection" in Fig. 3, which suggests that the model has been trained on data from different seasons. 

Additionally, the authors have used data augmentation techniques such as color jitter, mosaic, VFL, DFL, and CIoU, which can help improve the model's generalizability by increasing the diversity of the training data. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. It is also not clear if the authors have used any other techniques to ensure generalizability, such as domain randomization or domain adaptation. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken to ensure generalizability.
