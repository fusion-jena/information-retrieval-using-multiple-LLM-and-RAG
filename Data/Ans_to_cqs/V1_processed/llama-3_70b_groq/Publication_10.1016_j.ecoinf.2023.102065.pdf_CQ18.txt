The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that a validation set was used to evaluate the model's performance during fine-tuning. 

In Section 2.5, it is mentioned that 100 ROIs per species were randomly sampled to form a validation set. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on this validation set during fine-tuning, and the performance metrics were used to monitor the model's performance. However, the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance are not mentioned in the provided context.
