I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. The context discusses the use of machine learning methods, including random forest and maximum entropy modeling, for insect forest risk assessment and pine wilt disease prediction. It also mentions the development of an ensemble model that integrates the RF and Maxent models, which shows improved predictive power. However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models.
