I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing a deep learning method for underwater target detection, but it does not include any information about the code implementation or where it can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
