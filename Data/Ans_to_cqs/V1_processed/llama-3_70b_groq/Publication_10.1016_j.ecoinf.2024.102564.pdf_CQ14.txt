The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that three essential parameters were configured in the RF training: the number of random regression trees (ntree), the number of division variables (mtry), and the minimum size of nodes (node size). However, it does not specify the optimization method used to determine these hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
