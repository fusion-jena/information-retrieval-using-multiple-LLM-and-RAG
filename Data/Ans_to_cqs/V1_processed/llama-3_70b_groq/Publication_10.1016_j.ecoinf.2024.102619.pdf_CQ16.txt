Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context focuses on the classification performance of different models, hyperparameter tuning, and the time required for training and testing phases. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, convergence, or a specific number of epochs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
