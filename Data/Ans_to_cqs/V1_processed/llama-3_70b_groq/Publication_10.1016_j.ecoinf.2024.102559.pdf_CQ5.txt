The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, land use and land cover classification, and invasive species detection, with references to datasets related to these topics, such as the Santa Barbara County coast dataset. However, it does not provide information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
