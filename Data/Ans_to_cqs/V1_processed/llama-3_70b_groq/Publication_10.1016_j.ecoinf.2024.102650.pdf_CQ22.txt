The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the ERNIE model and its performance in previous studies, but it does not specify the evaluation metrics used. 

However, it does mention perplexity (P(D)) as a metric, which is often used to evaluate the performance of language models. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts a sample of text, with lower perplexity indicating better performance. 

It's possible that other evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. may have been used, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
