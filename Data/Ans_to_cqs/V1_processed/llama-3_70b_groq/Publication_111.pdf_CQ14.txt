According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) method in the Hyperopt package. This is mentioned in the text as "for parameter finding and optimization, we used the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) method in the Hyperopt package". 

However, it is also mentioned that a grid search is applied to determine the optimal hyperparameters for some models, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF). This is stated in the text as "each learning model is subjected to a grid search in order to achieve the optimal parameter tuning". 

Therefore, the answer is that the hyperparameters are optimized using both the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) method and grid search, depending on the model.
