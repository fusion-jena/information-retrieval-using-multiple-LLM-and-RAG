The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models in this context are AUC (area under the receiver operating curve) and TSS (true skill statistic). These metrics are used to compare the performance and accuracy of different models, including the deep learning model. AUC values range from 0.5 to 1, with higher values indicating improved accuracy and predictive power. TSS values range from -1 to +1, with positive values indicating a perfect fit.
