The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the validation set is used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model, but it does not specify the method used for optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
