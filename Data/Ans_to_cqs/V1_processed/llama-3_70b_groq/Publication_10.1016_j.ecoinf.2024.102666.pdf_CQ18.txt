I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and atmospheric correction, discussing various algorithms and models for atmospheric correction, but it does not provide information on model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
