I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture of the model, which is a modified version of ResNet50, and its application to bioacoustic tasks. It cites various research papers and references related to deep learning and bioacoustics, but it does not provide information about the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used to build the model.
