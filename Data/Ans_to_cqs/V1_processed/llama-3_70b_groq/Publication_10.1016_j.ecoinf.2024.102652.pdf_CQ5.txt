The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of a deep learning method, specifically the MU-NET algorithm, to construct soil salinity maps using remote sensing images. It mentions that the method has been used in various remote sensing image classification-related tasks, such as olive canopy extraction and saline soil extraction, but it does not specify the datasets used in these tasks.

The context also mentions that the training set must be normalized and standardized, and that the batch size was set to 32, but it does not provide information about the datasets used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
