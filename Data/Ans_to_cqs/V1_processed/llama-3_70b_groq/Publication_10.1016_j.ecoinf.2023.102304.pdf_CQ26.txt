Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, vegetation cover, and climate conditions, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
