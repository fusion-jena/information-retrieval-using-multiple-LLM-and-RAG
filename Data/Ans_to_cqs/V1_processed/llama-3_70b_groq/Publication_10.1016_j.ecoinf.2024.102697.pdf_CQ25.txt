The provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. The text discusses model complexity, feature selection, and the use of random forest models in remote sensing, but it does not specify the task or objective of the model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
