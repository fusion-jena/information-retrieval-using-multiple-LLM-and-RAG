I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It appears to focus on the development and comparison of different classification models for land cover mapping using satellite data. The context discusses the feature variables used, the experimental design, and the structure of the SSA-TPRF model, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
