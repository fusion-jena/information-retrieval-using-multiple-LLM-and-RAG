The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that the learning rate is divided by 10 every 20 epochs until it reaches 10^(-6), but it does not specify when the training process is considered complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
