I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the study area, data acquisition and processing, network structure, and performance of the Res_AUNet model, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
