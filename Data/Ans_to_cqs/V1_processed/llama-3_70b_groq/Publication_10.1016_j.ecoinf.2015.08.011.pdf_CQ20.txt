I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the selection of the number of layers, neurons, learning rates, and epochs for model training, as well as the trial-and-error method used to determine the optimal number of neurons and learning rate. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs or TPUs.
