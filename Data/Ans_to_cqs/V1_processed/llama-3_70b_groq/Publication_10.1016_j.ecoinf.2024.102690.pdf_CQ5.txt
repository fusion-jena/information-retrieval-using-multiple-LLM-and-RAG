The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning pipeline datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological sources, ecosystem services, and spatial analysis, and it mentions various datasets used for this purpose, including:

* CRU dataset
* Guangzhou statistical yearbook
* National grain trading center
* Geographic Data Sharing Infrastructure, College of Urban and Environmental Science, Peking University
* GlobeLand30
* ALOS World 3D-30m
* China soil map based harmonized world soil database (HWSD)
* MODIS image MOD13Q1

These datasets seem to be related to environmental and spatial data, but they are not typical deep learning pipeline datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it appears to be out of context.
