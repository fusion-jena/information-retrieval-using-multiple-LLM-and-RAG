Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to various topics such as IoT-enabled smart farming, MODIS remotely sensed data, machine learning, and digital twins in smart farming, but it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is common knowledge in the field of machine learning and deep learning that preprocessing steps typically include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. These steps are crucial to prepare the data for training a model and can significantly impact the model's performance.

Normalization involves scaling numerical values to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming numerical values to a common scale, such as standardization or min-max scaling. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer. If you have more context or information about the specific deep learning model or dataset, I may be able to provide more guidance on the preprocessing steps involved.
