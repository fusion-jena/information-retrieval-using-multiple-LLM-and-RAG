Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in image processing, machine translation, speech recognition, and computer vision, but it does not delve into the details of data annotation techniques.

The context does mention that deep learning models are trained on extensive datasets, and that neural networks are constructed through training involving a large set of inputs and labeled outputs. However, it does not provide information on how the data is annotated or what specific techniques are used for annotation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
