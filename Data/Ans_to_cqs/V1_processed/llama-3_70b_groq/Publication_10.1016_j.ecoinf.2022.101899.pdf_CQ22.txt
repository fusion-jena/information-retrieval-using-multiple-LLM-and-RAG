Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context focuses on the application of deep learning to predict wildfire events, the calculation of NDVI scores, and the implementation of the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach to consider model uncertainty. However, it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
