The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the datasets are related to coral reef classification. 

In Table 2, the performance of hand-crafted descriptors and D-CNN models is shown for the "first dataset". Similarly, in Table 4, the performance is shown for the "third dataset" which is referred to as the "Bleached, healthy, and dead (BHD) Dataset". 

It can be concluded that the datasets used are custom datasets specific to coral reef classification, but the exact names or details of the datasets are not provided.
