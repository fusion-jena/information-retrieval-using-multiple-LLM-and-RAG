The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. It only mentions the use of the LazyPredict Python library for autoML and hyperparameter tuning. It also mentions the use of XGB, RF, and ET models, which are likely referring to XGBoost, Random Forest, and Extra Trees, respectively. However, it does not provide information about the deep learning framework used to build the stacking-based ANN meta model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
