The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the model's performance in terms of accuracy and F-measure, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during training. It only mentions the exponential decay of the learning rate every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was evaluated or monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
