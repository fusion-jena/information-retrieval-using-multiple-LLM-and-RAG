Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The text focuses on the application of the Ppf-CM method and the benefits of using deep learning with Google Earth Engine, but it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
