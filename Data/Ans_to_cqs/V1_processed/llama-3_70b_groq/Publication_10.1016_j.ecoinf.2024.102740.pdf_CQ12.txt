The context provided does not mention the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Instead, it mentions the use of a Random Forest (RF) technique for classification. Random Forest is a type of ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. It is not a type of deep learning model.
