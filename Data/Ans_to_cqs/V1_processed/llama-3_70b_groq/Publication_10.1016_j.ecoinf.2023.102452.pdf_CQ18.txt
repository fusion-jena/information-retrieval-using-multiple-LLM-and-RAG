Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the use of GP and ANN models for streamflow forecasting, the data split for training and testing, and the evaluation metrics used (such as MEE, DW, DWE, NSE Train, and NSE Test). However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during the training process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
