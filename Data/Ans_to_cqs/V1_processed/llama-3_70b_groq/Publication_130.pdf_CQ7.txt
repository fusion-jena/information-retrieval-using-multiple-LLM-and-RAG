The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer some information about the data splitting process from the text.

In the context, it is mentioned that the authors selected 100 images for the validation dataset and then duplicated the remaining pictures until 900 images were available for the training dataset. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria for this split are not specified.

In general, the common practice in deep learning is to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during training, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

The criteria for splitting the data into these sets can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting (to maintain the same class distribution in each set), and temporal splitting (e.g., using older data for training and newer data for testing).

In this case, we can only infer that the authors split their data into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria used for this split are not provided.
