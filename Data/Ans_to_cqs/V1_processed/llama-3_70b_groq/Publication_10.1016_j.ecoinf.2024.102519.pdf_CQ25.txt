I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model. The text discusses various applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimization algorithms in different fields, but it does not specify the purpose of a deep learning model. It mentions the use of deep learning in landslide susceptibility prediction, but it does not provide information about the specific purpose of the deep learning model in that context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
