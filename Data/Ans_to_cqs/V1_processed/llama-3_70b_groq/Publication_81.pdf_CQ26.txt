The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically the ESK model, for classifying fish species and determining outgroups using DNA barcode sequences.

However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used techniques to handle imbalanced datasets or small datasets, as they mention the problem of overfitting in small datasets and the use of Elastic Net to improve the generalization ability of the ESK model. Additionally, the authors mention the use of one-hot encoding to convert DNA sequences into numerical data, which is a common preprocessing technique.

However, specific techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined which techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
