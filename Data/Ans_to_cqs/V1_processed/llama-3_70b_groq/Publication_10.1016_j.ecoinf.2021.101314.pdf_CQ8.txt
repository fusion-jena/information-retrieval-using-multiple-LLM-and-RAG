I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are queries that describe the same set of localities in different ways, and filtering them based on accuracy and complexity. The context mentions parameters that can be set to control the size and complexity of the redescriptions, but it does not provide information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
