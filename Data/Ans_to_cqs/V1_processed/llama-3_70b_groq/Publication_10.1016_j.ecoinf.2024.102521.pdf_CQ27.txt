Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the STARdbi system, its components, and related research papers. It describes the input and output of various components, such as STARdbi_train and STARdbi_inference, but does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
