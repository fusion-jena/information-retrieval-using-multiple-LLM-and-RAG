Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of feature extraction parameters and the performance evaluation of different CNN deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of stratified 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation is a technique used to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalizability, which can help mitigate the effects of randomness in the training data. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a specific optimizer (RMSProp) and learning rates, which can also affect the randomness in the training process. However, it does not provide explicit information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

In summary, the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and it is unclear what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
