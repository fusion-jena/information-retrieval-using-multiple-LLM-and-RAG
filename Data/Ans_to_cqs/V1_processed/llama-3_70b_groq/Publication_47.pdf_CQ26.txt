The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data set was randomly split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%), and 20% of the training set was used for validation. This suggests that stratified splitting was not used, as the splitting was done randomly.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Sampbias, a method for quantifying geographic sampling biases in species distribution data, which implies that the authors are aware of the potential issue of sampling bias in their data. However, it does not specify how they addressed this bias.

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection techniques being used to address data bias. Therefore, it is unclear what techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
