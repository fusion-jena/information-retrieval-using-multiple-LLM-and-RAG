I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a study on wetland use intensity in East Africa, using Sentinel-2 satellite data and machine learning techniques. It provides information on the study area, data collection, and results of statistical tests, but it does not discuss the optimization of model hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
