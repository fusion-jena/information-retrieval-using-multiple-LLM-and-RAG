I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to landslide susceptibility mapping and machine learning models, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
