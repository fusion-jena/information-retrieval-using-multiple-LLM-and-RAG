I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The "Data availability" section only states that the datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
