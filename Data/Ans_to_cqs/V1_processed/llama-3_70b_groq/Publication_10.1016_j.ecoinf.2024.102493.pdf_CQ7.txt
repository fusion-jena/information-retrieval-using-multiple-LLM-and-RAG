I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to geographical detectors, optimal parameter-based geographical detectors, and the analysis of vegetation dynamics using various factors such as climate, terrain, and human activity. It discusses the use of Q values, factor detectors, and optimal scale and discretization parameters, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
