Based on the provided context, it appears that the research study is focused on analyzing the impacts of urbanization and land cover change on urban climate and agriculture in China. The study utilizes remote sensing data, specifically NDVI datasets (NDVI3g) generated from AVHRR sensors by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS).

There is no explicit mention of deep learning pipeline or methods utilized for collecting raw data in the context. However, it can be inferred that the study relies on remote sensing data and public datasets, such as NDVI datasets, for analysis.

It does not appear that surveys are used as a method for collecting raw data in this study. The context does not mention any surveys or questionnaire-based data collection methods.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this study appear to be remote sensing data from sensors (AVHRR sensors) and public datasets (NDVI datasets).
