The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: 

1. Area Under Curve (AUC): This metric is used to evaluate the performance of the model across all thresholds. The AUC value for the CNN model is 0.917, which indicates its superiority over the BIOCLIM model with an AUC value of 0.68.

2. Kappa: This metric is used to evaluate the performance of the model, and the values obtained are 0.652 for BIOCLIM and 0.94 for CNN, respectively. This indicates the superiority of the CNN model over BIOCLIM.

3. True Skill Statistic (TSS): This metric is also used to evaluate the performance of the model, and the values obtained are 0.44 for BIOCLIM and 0.652 for CNN, respectively.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of its ability to predict species distribution. However, accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
