I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper or study that involves data-driven earth system science, machine learning models, and dataset features. However, it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
