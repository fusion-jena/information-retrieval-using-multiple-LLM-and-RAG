I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud processing platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis, but it does not provide information about the underlying hardware resources used for training the model. GEE is a cloud-based platform that provides access to petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, allowing for high-performance processing and analysis of images, but it does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware resources. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
