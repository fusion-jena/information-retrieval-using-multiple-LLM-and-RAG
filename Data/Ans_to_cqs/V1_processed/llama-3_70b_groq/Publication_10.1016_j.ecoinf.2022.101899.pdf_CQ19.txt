The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only mentions that Halgamuge et al. (2020) used deep learning technology to estimate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions in Australia, but it does not provide details on the specific framework used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
