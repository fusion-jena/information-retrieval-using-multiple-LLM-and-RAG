Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a plant identification study, and it discusses the dataset, model architecture, and experiments, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
