Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are dropout and DropConnect. Dropout is a technique that randomly discards the output of the hidden nodes during training, while DropConnect randomly discards the input of the hidden layer. These methods are employed during fine-tuning to prevent overfitting. There is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context.
