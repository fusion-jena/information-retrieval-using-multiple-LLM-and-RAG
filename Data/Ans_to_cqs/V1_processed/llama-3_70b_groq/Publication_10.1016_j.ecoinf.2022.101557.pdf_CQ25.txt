Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and various techniques such as data pre-processing, cross-validation, and optimization, but it does not specify the task the model is intended to perform. 

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the model is likely used for a task related to image analysis or computer vision, given the mention of 80x80 pixel areas and maps. But without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific purpose of the model, such as classification, segmentation, detection, or something else.
