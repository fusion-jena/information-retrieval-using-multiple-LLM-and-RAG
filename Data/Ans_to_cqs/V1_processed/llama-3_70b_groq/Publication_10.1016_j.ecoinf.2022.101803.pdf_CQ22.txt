The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the performance evaluation of various models, including XGBoost, random forests, and the proposed RBF-GFR model. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models are R2 and R2DEV.

R2 is a measure of the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It is calculated as 1 minus the ratio of the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values to the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and their mean.

R2DEV is a modified version of R2, which is preferred for species abundance counts. It is based on the residual deviance and is calculated as 1 minus the ratio of the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values to the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and their mean, with an additional term to account for the log transformation of the data.

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context. These metrics are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models, but the context suggests that the models are being used for regression tasks, such as predicting species abundance counts.
