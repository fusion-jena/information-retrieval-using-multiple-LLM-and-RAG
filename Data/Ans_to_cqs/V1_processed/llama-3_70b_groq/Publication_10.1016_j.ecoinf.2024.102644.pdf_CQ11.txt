I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository link. The context primarily discusses the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a data provider for species observation data, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its repository link. GBIF is mentioned as a repository for biodiversity data, but it is not a repository for deep learning pipelines. The context also mentions other repositories such as OBIS, but it does not provide a link to a specific deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.
