I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. It mentions various research papers and articles related to wildlife monitoring using camera traps and machine learning, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository. Some of the papers may have made their code available, but this information is not provided in the context. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
