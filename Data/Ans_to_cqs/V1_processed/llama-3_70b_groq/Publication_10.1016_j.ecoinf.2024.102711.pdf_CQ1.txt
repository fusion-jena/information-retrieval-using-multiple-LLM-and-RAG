I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on automated machine learning (AutoML), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on data collection methods. It mentions the use of a limited dataset with 113 data records, but it does not specify how this data was collected. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
