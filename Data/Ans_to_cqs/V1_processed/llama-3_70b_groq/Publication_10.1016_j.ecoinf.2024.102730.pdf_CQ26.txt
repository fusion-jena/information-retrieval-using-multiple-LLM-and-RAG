Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the applications of deep learning in ecology, vegetation studies, and plant species identification, but it does not delve into the specifics of addressing data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention various machine learning models and techniques, such as supervised learning, regression, image segmentation, support vector machines, boosted tree ensembles, and artificial neural networks. It also mentions the use of hybrid deep learning for plant species identification. 

Despite this, the context does not provide information on how to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
