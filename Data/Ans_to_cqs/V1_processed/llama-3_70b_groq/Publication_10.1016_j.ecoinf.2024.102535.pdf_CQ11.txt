I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the application of deep learning techniques for hydrothermal vent substrata image classification, but it does not provide information about the data repository used to store the pipeline. The references cited in the text are related to uncertainty quantification in deep learning and do not provide a link to a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
