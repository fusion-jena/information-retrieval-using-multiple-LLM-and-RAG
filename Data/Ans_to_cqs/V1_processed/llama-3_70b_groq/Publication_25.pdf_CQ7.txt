Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily discusses the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, particularly in remote sensing, due to the limited availability of training data and the need for large datasets. It also mentions the use of self-supervised learning and semi-supervised frameworks to address these limitations. However, it does not provide information on how to split the data for model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
