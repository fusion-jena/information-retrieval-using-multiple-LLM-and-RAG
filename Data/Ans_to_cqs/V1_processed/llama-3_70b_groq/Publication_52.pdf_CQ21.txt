Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the benefits and characteristics of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) in handling Big Data, their advantages over traditional learning algorithms, and their mathematical basis. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
