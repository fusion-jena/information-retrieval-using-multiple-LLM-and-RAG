The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to feature selection and classification models, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. 

The context mentions feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) to reduce redundancy in multi-source feature datasets and improve model performance. It also discusses the use of various classification models such as LightGBM, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, but it does not mention regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
