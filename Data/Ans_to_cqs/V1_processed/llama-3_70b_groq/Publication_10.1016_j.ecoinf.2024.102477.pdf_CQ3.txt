I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on deep learning methods, specifically SLSTM and SGRU, and their applications in time-series prediction and air pollution forecasting. It also discusses the use of SVR, a machine learning method, for parameter optimization. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
