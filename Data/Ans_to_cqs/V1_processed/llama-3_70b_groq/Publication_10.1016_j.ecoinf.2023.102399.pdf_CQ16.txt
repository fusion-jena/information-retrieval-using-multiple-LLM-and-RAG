Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to a study on object detection using YOLO models, and it provides various metrics such as RMSE, MRE, and R2 to evaluate the performance of the models. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Typically, in machine learning, training is considered complete when a certain stopping criterion is met, such as a plateau in validation loss, a maximum number of epochs, or a desired level of accuracy. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this study.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
