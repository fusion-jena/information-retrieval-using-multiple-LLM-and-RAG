The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using validation and test sets separately to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, leading to generalizability and scalability towards unseen datasets. This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training using these evaluation sets, but the specific strategy or metrics used for monitoring are not mentioned.
