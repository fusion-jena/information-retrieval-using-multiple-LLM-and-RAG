The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention that the images in the training set were augmented in various ways to gain a more robust and better generalizing classifier. This augmentation includes flipping the images horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. This suggests that the authors are attempting to introduce some randomness in the training data to improve the model's generalizability. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in other aspects of the pipeline, such as weight initialization or shuffling of the data. Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
