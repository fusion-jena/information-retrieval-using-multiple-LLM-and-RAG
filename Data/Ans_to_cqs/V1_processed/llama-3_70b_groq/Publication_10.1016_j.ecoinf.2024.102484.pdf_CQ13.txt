I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to a study on soil degradation, discussing factors such as land-use types, natural factors, and anthropogenic factors, as well as data collection and statistical formulas. There is no mention of deep learning or any related concepts. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
