The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that cross-validation was used to ensure the statistical results and prevent overfitting. 

In the context of cross-validation, the dataset is randomly shuffled and divided into a training and an evaluation set K times, where K is the number of crosses. In this case, K is 5. This implies that the data was split into training and evaluation sets 5 times, but the exact criteria for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets.
