The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and training regime, but it does not discuss regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. 

However, it is worth noting that the authors mention that they did not use techniques like SMOTE, oversampling, or class weights in the first stage of their research, and plan to pursue these in a second phase. This suggests that they may have considered other regularization methods, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
