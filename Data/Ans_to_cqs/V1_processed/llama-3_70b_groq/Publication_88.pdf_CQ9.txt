I don't know. The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only provides information about the architecture of the EF network, the number of samples in the training, validation, and test sets for the Amazon and Cerrado databases, and the setup used for training the EF and SN models. There is no mention of where the data repository is available.
