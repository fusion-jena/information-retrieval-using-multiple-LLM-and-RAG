The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 10 K-fold cross-validation and 10-fold bootstrapping. This is mentioned in the context as "After 10 K-fold cross-validation and 10-fold bootstrapping, all models were assessed based on the mean values for Area Under the Curve AUC, True Skill Statistics TSS, Cohen's KAPPA, point-biserial correlation COR, and Receiver Operator Characteristics ROC." This suggests that the model performance was evaluated using these techniques to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance.
