The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework is used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and VGGnet, but does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework is used.
