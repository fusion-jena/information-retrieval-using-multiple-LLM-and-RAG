Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, including genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and deep learning, in different fields like drought modeling, soil cation exchange capacity prediction, and mineral prospecting. It does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline or regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
