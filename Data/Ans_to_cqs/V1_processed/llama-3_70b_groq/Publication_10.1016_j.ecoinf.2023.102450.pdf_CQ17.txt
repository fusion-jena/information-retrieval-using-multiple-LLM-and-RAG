I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to animal tracking and recognition using deep learning, but it does not provide information about specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
