Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces and evaluating the effectiveness of models in species distribution modeling. It discusses various methods, such as geographic filtering and representativeness-oriented methods, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
