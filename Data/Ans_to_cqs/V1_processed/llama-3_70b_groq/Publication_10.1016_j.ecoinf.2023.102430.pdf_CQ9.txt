I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the implementation of the algorithm in MATLAB and Python, the training and testing process, and the results of the experiment. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository used in this study.
