I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of a depth-attention YOLOv5 model for object detection, but it does not provide information about where the data or code for the pipeline is stored or shared. The references cited in the context are academic papers and do not seem to be related to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
