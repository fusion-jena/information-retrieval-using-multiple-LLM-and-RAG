I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text appears to be discussing a model called FERM (Freshwater Ecosystem Response Model) and its parameters, but it does not mention deep learning. The keywords and abstract suggest that the model is related to environmental flow, riparian ecosystems, and biodiversity maintenance, but the specific purpose of the model is not clear.
