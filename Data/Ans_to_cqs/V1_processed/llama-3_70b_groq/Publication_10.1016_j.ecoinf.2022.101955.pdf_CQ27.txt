Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the classification of land use and land cover (LULC) using different machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and support vector machines (SVM). It discusses the model performance, tuning parameters, and the results of the classification. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
