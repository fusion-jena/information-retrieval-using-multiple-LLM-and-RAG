Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of PyTorch, ResNet architecture, and the training process of a deep learning model for image recognition. It does not provide information about the specific regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting.

However, it is worth noting that the ResNet architecture, which is used in the context, is known to have some inherent regularization properties due to its residual connections and batch normalization layers. These properties can help reduce overfitting to some extent. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine if other regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization were used in this specific pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
