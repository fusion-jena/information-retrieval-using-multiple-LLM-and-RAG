The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the model is likely used for regression tasks. 

The model architecture consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. The output layer is one-dimensional, which suggests that the model is predicting a single continuous value. Additionally, the performance metrics used to evaluate the model, such as the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2), are commonly used in regression tasks. 

Furthermore, the context mentions that the model is predicting the Mn content, which is likely a continuous value. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is to predict the Mn content from the spectral reflectance data, which is a regression task.
