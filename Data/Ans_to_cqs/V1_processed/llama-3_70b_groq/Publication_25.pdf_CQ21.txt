Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training process, discussing the use of self-supervised and semi-supervised approaches, and the impact of hand-annotated data on model performance. It also includes a figure illustrating the improvement in prediction quality during the training pipeline. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of saliency maps, or generation of confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
