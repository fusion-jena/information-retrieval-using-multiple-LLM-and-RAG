Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in remote sensing, particularly for tree detection, and discusses the challenges of limited training data and the potential benefits of semi-supervised and self-supervised learning approaches. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used to train the deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
