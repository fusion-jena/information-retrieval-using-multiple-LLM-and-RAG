Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the optimization of parameters, the use of siamese neural networks, and the metric learning approach, but it does not specify the evaluation metrics used.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of TensorBoard, a visualization tool, to study the performance of the runs. This suggests that some metrics are being tracked and visualized, but the specific metrics are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
