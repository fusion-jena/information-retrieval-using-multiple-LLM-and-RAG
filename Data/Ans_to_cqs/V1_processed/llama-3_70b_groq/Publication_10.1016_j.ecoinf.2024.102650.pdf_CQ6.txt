Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Word segmentation: This involves dividing the natural language composed of Chinese text into meaningful words, which is a key technology in text analyses.

2. Stop word removal: Stop words, such as notes, advertisements, useless numbers, punctuation marks, and repeated texts on websites, are filtered out.

3. Text filtering: Unnecessary symbols and noise are filtered out through a manual review.

4. Data cleaning: This includes filtering out user-generated text that deviated from the theme.

No mention of normalization or scaling is made in the provided context. However, it is common in deep learning to perform these steps as part of the preprocessing pipeline. Normalization involves scaling numerical values to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming numerical values to a common scale, such as standardization or feature scaling.

It is worth noting that the context focuses on text preprocessing for a specific task, and the preprocessing steps may vary depending on the task and dataset.
