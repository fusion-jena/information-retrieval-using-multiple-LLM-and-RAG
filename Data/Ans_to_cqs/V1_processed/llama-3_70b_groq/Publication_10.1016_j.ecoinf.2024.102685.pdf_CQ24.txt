The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses Random Forest, a machine learning method, and its application in seagrass mapping and monitoring. It explains how Random Forest works, its advantages, and its use in various studies.

Random Forest is a machine learning method that combines decision trees and bootstrapping, which involves training each decision tree with a bootstrapped sample of the training data and randomly selecting features at every split node. This process inherently involves randomness, but the context does not discuss strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Since the context does not provide information about deep learning or handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
