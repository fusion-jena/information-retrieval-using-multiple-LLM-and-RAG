The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a YoloV3 model, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the keywords section as "YoloV3" and also in the introduction section where it is stated that the author implemented the same hyperparameters as the Yolo model. YoloV3 is a specific architecture of CNNs that is commonly used for object detection tasks.
