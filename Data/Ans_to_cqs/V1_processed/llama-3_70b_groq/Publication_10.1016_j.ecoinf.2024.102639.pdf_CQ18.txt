Based on the provided context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. This is mentioned in the text as "a synergistic application of grid search and cross-validation" to calibrate the regularization parameter and kernel type for the SVM model. Additionally, it is stated that the goal is to "ascertain the configuration that minimizes cross-validation error, thereby enhancing model precision." This suggests that cross-validation is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to select the best hyperparameters.
