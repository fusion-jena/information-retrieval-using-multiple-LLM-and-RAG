The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning pipelines or specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context primarily focuses on the importance of understanding data collection trends and biases in biodiversity repositories, particularly in the context of marine fish occurrences.

However, it does mention the application of filters to enhance the quality and reliability of the information. Specifically, the dataset was curated by filtering out records with NA values in certain columns (scientific name, family, year, longitude, and latitude) and removing duplicate records with identical latitude and longitude values. This suggests that some form of data cleaning and preprocessing was performed, but the specific techniques used to address data bias are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
