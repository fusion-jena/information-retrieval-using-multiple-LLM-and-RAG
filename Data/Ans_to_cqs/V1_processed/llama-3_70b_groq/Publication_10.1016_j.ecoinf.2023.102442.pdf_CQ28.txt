The platform used to deploy the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the initial LULC classification was done using Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a cloud processing platform. It is possible that GEE was also used to deploy the deep learning model, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I cannot confirm the exact platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
