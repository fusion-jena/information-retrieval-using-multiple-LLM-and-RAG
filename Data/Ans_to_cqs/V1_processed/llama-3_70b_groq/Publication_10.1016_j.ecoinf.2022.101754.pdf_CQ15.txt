I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses various machine learning methods, including AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in these methods. Additionally, the context does not specifically focus on deep learning pipelines, but rather on machine learning methods for estimating above-ground biomass from airborne LiDAR data. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
