The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the dataset was balanced, which could help in preventing bias towards a particular class. Additionally, various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes were used during the training of classification models. This could help in increasing the diversity of the training data and improving the model's generalizability. 

It is also worth noting that the models were pre-trained on ImageNet, which is a large and diverse dataset. This could help in learning generalizable features that can be fine-tuned for the specific task at hand. However, without further information, it is difficult to say what other measures were taken to ensure generalizability.
