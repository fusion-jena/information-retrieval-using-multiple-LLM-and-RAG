Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the results of classification and regression tasks, CNN performance metrics, and references to various research papers and reports.

However, based on the context, we can infer that some postprocessing steps might have been involved, such as metrics calculation, as the results include performance metrics like MSE, MAPE, and Acc%. But there is no explicit mention of other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training, as this information is not provided in the context.
