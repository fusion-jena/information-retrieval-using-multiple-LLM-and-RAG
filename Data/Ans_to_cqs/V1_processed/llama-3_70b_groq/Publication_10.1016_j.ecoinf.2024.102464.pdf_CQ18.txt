Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The ROC curves are used to quantify the proportion of correctly and incorrectly classified samples, with the true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1-specificity) represented on the vertical and horizontal lines, respectively. The red and blue curves in Fig. 3 represent the mean area under the curve (AUC) of training and test data, respectively. This suggests that the model performance is being evaluated and compared between the training and test data using the ROC curves and AUC metrics.
