The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on traditional machine learning algorithms like SVR (Support Vector Regression), MLR (Multiple Linear Regression), RF (Random Forest), and XGBoost. 

However, it does discuss parameter tuning and optimization techniques for these algorithms. For instance, it mentions grid search for optimizing RF and XGBoost parameters, and selecting the appropriate kernel function and optimizing the "C" parameter for SVR. 

Since the context does not provide information about deep learning or optimization techniques like SGD or Adam, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
