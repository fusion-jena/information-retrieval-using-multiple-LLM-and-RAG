The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning methods, specifically SLSTM and SGRU models, to time-series prediction tasks, including air pollution analysis and agricultural product sales forecasting. There is no mention of datasets commonly used in computer vision or image classification tasks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
