Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques, attention mechanisms, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, specifically in the domain of plant identification. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not mention surveys, sensors, public datasets, or any other methods of collecting raw data.
