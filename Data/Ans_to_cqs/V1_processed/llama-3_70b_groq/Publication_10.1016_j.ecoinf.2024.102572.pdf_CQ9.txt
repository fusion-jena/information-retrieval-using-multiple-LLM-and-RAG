The provided context does not explicitly mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the obtained data is saved in "CSV" format on Google Drive for later examination. Additionally, it references an official documentation URL (https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084) that may be related to the dataset, but it does not specify the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
