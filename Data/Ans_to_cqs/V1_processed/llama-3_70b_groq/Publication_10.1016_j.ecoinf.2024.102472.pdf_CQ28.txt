I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context discusses various studies and research papers related to hyperspectral image classification, artificial neural networks, and machine learning models for estimating carbon stocks, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
