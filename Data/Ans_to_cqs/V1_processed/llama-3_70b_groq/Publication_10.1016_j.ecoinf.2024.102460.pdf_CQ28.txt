I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning models such as LSTM, PLUS, and FMOP for land use/cover change simulation and prediction, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
