I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the dataset splitting, deep learning models, patch selection process, model training, and evaluation, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
