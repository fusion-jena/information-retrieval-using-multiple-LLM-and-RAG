The provided context mentions several data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for audio data. These techniques include:

1. Changing the frequency, pitch, and volume of audio signals
2. Shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms
3. Adding additional noise
4. Noise mixing
5. Random signal amplitude
6. Sound mixing with other target signals and/or reverberations
7. Mosaic augmentation, which involves merging four original spectrograms into one big input image for model training

These techniques are used to increase the variability of audio data in a training dataset, which can improve model performance, especially when working with limited data. However, it's worth noting that the context does not mention traditional computer vision augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, as these may not be directly applicable to audio data.
