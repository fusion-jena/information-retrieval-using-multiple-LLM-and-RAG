I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the target and attack models, dataset distribution, and hyperparameters used for training, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
