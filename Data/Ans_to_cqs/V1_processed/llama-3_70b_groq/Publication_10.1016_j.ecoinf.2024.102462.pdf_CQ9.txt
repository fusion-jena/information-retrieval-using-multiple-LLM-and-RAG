I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored. It discusses the importance of annotated data for training deep learning models, the process of training and testing the models, and the results of the observer study. However, it does not provide information about where the data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository used in this study.
