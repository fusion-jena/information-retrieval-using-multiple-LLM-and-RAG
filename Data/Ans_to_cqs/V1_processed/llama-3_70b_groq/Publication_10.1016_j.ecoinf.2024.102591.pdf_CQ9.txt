I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline or any specific repository where the data is stored. It mentions Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-based platform that hosts a vast remote sensing data catalog, but it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Additionally, it mentions EFFIS database, Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), and PostgreSQL database, but it does not provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
