The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of a Random Forest (RF) model for predicting net growth in the Atlantic Forest. 

Regarding the generalizability of the RF model, the context mentions that the evaluated models showed satisfactory generalization power, indicated by similar precision results between the observed and estimated data in the validation for all variables studied. However, it does not specify the measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
