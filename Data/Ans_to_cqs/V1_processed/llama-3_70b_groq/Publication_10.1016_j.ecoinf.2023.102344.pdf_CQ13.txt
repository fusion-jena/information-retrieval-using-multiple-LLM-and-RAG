Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context discusses various deep learning architectures, including ResNet and InceptionV3, and mentions the use of techniques like batch-updated stochastic gradient descent, label smoothing, and factorized convolutional layers. However, it does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the models.

The only mention of hyperparameters is in the title of the paper "Hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent: plant species identification by using hybrid deep learning" which suggests that hyperparameters were tuned, but it does not provide the specific values or details about the hyperparameters.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
