I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of Landsat 8 satellite images, atmospheric correction, and vegetation indices for fire risk mapping, but it does not provide information on the evaluation of a deep learning model. The mention of deep learning in the text is only a suggestion for future work to refine fire risk maps, but it does not provide specific details on the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
