Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on deep learning applications in agriculture, forestry, and plant classification, as well as the introduction of a new dataset and the evaluation of various deep learning models. It does not discuss the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to employ strategies such as:

1. Fixing the random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
2. Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting and improve model robustness.
3. Implementing data augmentation to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.
4. Performing multiple runs with different random initializations to evaluate the model's stability.

These strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, and therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given information.
