Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the active learning approach, CNN model development, and hyperparameter tuning. It does not provide information on regularization techniques used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
