I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of deep learning for wildfire event predictions, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in the model. The context focuses more on the methodology and results of the study, rather than the specific implementation details of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
