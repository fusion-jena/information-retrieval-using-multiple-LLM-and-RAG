Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is a form of stratified splitting. In the "Biased Dataset" section, it is mentioned that 70% of the data is taken for training and 30% for testing, but this is done randomly for each species in the dataset. This approach can lead to bias, as the distribution of photos per species may not be uniform.

To address this bias, the "Unbiased Dataset" approach is used, where images from the same specimen are placed either in the training dataset or the testing dataset, but not both. This ensures that the model is not biased towards a particular specimen or leaf type. This approach is not exactly stratified splitting, but it serves a similar purpose by ensuring that the training and testing datasets are representative of the overall dataset.

There is no mention of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection techniques being used to address data bias in the provided context.
