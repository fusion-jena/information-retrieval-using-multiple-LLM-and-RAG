According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is when successive model iterations do not reduce the F1 score. This is stated in the text as "Iterative model training stopped when the stopping criterion was reached, which was when successive model iterations did not reduce the F1 score." This implies that the training process continues until the model's performance on the validation set, as measured by the F1 score, stops improving.
