The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE). The RTMSPE is utilized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, which helps to remove the impact of heterogeneous observations. This metric is defined as the square root of the average of the δth trimmed squared errors, where δ is a value between 0 and 1. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance during training and adjust the tuning parameters accordingly.
