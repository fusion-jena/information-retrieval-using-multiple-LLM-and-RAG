The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for tree species classification, where the goal is to identify 18 different tree species (17 dominant tree species and a class of "Others") from images. The deep learning models, such as AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50, are used for patch-wise classification to identify the tree species.
