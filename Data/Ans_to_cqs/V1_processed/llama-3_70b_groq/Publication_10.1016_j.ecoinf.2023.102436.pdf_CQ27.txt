I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, landscape metrics, and urban design, but it does not provide information about model deployment. The mentioned papers and references are related to landscape analysis, environmental performance evaluation, and visual landscape elements, but they do not discuss model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
