Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training process of the deep learning model, specifically the ResNet 100 model, and its application to image classification tasks. It discusses the use of datasets, hyperparameters, and optimization-based methods for few-shot learning, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular context.
