The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires (Section 3.1) to determine the optimal number of trees in the Random Forest (RF) model. This suggests that some form of cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. 

Additionally, the context provides information about the wildfire events used to acquire training samples and validate the FIREMAP burned area (BA) product (Table 1) and the vegetation recovery product (Table 5). The use of multiple wildfire events from different locations and dates may contribute to the diversity of the dataset, which can help improve the model's generalizability. 

However, there is no mention of stratified splitting or other measures specifically taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken.
