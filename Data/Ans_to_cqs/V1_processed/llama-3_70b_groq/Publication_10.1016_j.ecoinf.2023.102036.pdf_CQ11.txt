I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various papers and techniques related to deep learning and image classification, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository where the pipeline is stored. The references cited in the context are mostly academic papers and do not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
