The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (Artificial Neural Network) are:

* Hidden layer sizes
* Activation
* Solver
* Alpha
* Learning rate

These hyperparameters are listed in Table 1, which presents the resulting hyperparameter values for each machine learning model, including the Artificial Neural Network.
