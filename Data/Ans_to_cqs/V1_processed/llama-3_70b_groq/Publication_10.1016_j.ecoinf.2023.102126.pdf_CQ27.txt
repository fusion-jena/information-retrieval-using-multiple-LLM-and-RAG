I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be discussing data sharing, repositories, and evaluating datasets using the F-UJI metric, but it does not provide information about deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
