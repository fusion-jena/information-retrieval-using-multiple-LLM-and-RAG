The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the dataset consists of 6570 pictures, and a random subset of 5256 pictures (80% of the dataset) was used for training the algorithms. It does not provide information on how these pictures were collected, whether through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other means. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
