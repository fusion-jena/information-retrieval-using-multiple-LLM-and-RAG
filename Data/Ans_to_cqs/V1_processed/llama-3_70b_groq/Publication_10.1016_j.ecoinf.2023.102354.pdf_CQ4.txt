The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The only data processing technique mentioned is linear interpolation, which is used to fill in missing data in the study. This technique is not a data augmentation technique, but rather a method for handling missing values. Therefore, I don't know what data augmentation techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline.
