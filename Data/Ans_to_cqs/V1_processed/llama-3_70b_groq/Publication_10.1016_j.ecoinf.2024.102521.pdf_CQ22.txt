Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and recall. Specifically, the context mentions "bounding box precision (the fraction of insect-containing bounding boxes among all bounding boxes returned by the algorithm)" and "recall (the proportion of all insects that were identified by the algorithm)". This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to accurately detect insects and draw bounding boxes around them. The precision and recall metrics are used to quantify this performance.
