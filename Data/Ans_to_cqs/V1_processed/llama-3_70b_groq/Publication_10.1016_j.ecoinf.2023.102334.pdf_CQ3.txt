I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the application of transformers in computer vision, including vision transformers, and their advantages in modeling long-term relationships between pixels. It also mentions various papers and techniques related to object detection, semantic segmentation, and face recognition, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
