The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the best-performing models were selected based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE). This suggests that MSE is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. 

Additionally, the context discusses the use of early stopping to avoid overfitting, which implies that the model's performance is being monitored during training, but the specific metrics used for this purpose are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that MSE is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, but other metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned.
