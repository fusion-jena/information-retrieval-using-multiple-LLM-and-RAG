I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on classifying maturity stages of Chilean hake using random forest classification, and it discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate the model, such as sensitivity, specificity, and precision. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
