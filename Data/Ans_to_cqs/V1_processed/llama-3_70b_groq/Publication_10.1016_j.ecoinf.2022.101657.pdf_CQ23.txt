Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is further trained on the WCS dataset, and evaluates the model's performance using the mean average precision (mAP) metric. However, it does not provide information on whether a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used to ensure the model's generalizability.

It is possible that the WCS dataset used for training and evaluation is diverse and representative of the target domain, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting being used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data or to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, and further information would be needed to determine this.
