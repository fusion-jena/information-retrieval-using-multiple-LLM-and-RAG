The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the architecture used, which is ResNet 100, a convolutional neural network (CNN). It does not specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used to implement the ResNet 100 architecture. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
