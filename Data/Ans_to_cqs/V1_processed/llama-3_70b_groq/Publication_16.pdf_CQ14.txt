The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the hyperparameters used in the model, such as the filter size, learning algorithm, optimizer, and dropout value. However, it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were chosen or optimized.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using grid search, random search, or some other method, but this information is not provided.
