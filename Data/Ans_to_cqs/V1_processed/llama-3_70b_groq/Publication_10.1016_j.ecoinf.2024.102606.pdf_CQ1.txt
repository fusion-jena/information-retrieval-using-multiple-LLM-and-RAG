Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology, specifically in species identification, and discusses the advantages of using deep learning models in this field. It also explains the process of training deep learning models, including data augmentation techniques, but it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not provide sufficient information to determine the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
