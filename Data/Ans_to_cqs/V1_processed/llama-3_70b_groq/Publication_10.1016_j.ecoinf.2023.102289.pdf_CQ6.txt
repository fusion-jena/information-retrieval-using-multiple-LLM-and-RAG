The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the LaDeco system, which uses pre-trained models, specifically the deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269 model, and does not provide information on training a model from scratch. 

However, it does mention that the system filters out negligible values by setting a threshold, which can be customized by the user. For example, values below 1% can be rounded to zero. This can be considered a form of data cleaning or filtering, but it is not a traditional preprocessing step typically applied before training a model.

In general, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important steps in preparing data for training a deep learning model. However, these steps are not mentioned in the provided context.
