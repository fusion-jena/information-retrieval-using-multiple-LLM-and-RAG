The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using the validation data forecasts. The context mentions that the structure and hyperparameters of the model are determined by assessing the effectiveness of validation data forecasts using data from points A, B, and C. This suggests that the model's performance is monitored and evaluated during training using the validation data, and the hyperparameters are adjusted accordingly to optimize the validation data forecast results.
