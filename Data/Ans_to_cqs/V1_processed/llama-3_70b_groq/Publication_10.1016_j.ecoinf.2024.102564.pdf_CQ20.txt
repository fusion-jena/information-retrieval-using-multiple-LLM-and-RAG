The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the configuration of the Random Forest (RF) training and the architecture of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
