Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Deep Learning algorithms (DELE) for handling and analyzing Big Data, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

The context focuses more on the advantages of ELMs, such as their ability to learn from huge training data sets and their fast learning speed, but it does not delve into the details of the model's development and evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
