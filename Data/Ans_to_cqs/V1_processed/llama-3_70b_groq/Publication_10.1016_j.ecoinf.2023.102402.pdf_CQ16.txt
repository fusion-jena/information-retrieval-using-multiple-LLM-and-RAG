Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on model validation and evaluation using metrics like AUC, TSS, and AICc, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria for determining its completion. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
