The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model. The context discusses the evaluation of the number of clusters in a K-Means clustering algorithm using metrics such as Distortion, Silhouette, and Calinski-Harabasz. These metrics are used to assess the quality of the clustering results, but they are not related to the evaluation of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query because the context does not provide information about the evaluation metrics for a deep learning model.
