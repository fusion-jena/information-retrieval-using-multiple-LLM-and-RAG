The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the ReduceLROnPlateau method. This method reduces the learning rate when the validation loss value plateaus, i.e., when it does not decrease after a certain number of consecutive epochs. Specifically, if the validation loss value does not decrease after 5 consecutive epochs, the learning rate is halved. If there is no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive epochs, the training process is terminated. This strategy helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model converges to an optimal solution.
