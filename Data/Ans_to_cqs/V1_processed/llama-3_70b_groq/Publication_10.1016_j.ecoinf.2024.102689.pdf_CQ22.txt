The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using various metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1 score, Mean Average Precision (mAP), Frames Per Second (FPS), and Box_loss. 

Precision represents the proportion of positive samples correctly recognized by the model, while Recall denotes the proportion of all actual positive samples that are correctly recognized. The F1 score is a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a comprehensive performance measure. 

Mean Average Precision (mAP) calculates the average precision across all categories of recall, serving as a commonly used metric in object detection. Frames Per Second (FPS) measures the real-time performance of the model, with higher values indicating faster image processing, making it suitable for real-time applications. 

Box_loss assesses the accuracy of the model's predicted bounding boxes against the actual ones, with lower values indicating better performance. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, enabling the identification of its strengths and weaknesses.
