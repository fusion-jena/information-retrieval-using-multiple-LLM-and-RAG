I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, wetland mapping, and machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
