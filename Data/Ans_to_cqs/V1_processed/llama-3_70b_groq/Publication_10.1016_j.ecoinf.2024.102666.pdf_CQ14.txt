I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the importance of accurate aerosol type understanding for high-quality Rrs retrieval, the impact of temporal and spatial factors on atmospheric correction, and the use of indices to evaluate the accuracy of AC algorithms. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as whether grid search, random search, or other methods are used.
