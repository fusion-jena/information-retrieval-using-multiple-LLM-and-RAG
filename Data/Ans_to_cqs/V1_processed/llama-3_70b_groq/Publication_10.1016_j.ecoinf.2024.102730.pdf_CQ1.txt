Based on the provided context, it appears that remote sensing data from satellites is a primary method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for vegetation studies. Specifically, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data is mentioned in several papers as a source of data for vegetation monitoring and biomass estimation.

Additionally, Landsat data is also mentioned as a source of data for blending with MODIS data to create synthetic NDVI time series for grassland biomass estimation.

It is also possible that other remote sensing data sources, such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series, are used for collecting raw data.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors as methods for collecting raw data in the provided context. Public datasets may be used, but it is not explicitly stated.

It is important to note that the provided context is limited to a specific domain (vegetation studies) and may not be representative of the broader deep learning pipeline.
