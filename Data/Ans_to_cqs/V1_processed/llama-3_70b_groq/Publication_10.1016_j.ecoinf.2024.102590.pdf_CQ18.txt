Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the data collection and preparation process, including the creation of sampling plots, data collection, and the creation of a balanced training set. It also mentions the use of random Forest classification and the assessment of model accuracy using a training/validation dataset. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
