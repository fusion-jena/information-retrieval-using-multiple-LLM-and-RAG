Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be a collection of references and authorship contributions related to various topics in computer vision, machine learning, and aquaculture. There is no specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
