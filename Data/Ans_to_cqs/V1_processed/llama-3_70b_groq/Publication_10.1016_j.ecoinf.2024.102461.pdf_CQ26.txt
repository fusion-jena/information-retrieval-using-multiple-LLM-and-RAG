I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, and it discusses the use of Jenks' natural break classification method for categorizing fire risk into different susceptibility classes. It also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests for evaluating fire risk. However, it does not provide any information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
