According to the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model to an edge device involves converting the model to the TensorFlow Lite format. This conversion reduces the model's size but also reduces its accuracy. After conversion, the model can be used on an edge device, such as a Raspberry Pi (RPi), for classification of unseen images. Additionally, the model can be optionally optimized for size or latency depending on the application requirements and edge device specifications. There is no mention of model serialization or platform selection in the provided context.
