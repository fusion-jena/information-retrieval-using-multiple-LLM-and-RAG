The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are horizontal flip, add/subtract intensity, Gaussian blur, additive Gaussian noise, and Fog. The Fog augmentation technique simulates fog in the video and is applied with a probability of 10%. The other augmentation techniques are applied simultaneously with a probability of 90%. 

Additionally, for action recognition, the data augmentation techniques used are temporal jittering, spatial crops, and horizontal flips. Temporal jittering involves randomly choosing the starting point of the 16 frames in the input video, with the constraint that there are 16 frames after the starting point in the video.
