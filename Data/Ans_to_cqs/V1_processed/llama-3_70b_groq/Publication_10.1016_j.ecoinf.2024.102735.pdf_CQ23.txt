The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models. However, it does discuss the use of ensemble models, specifically Random Forest (RF) models, and the optimization of their hyperparameters using the Optuna algorithm.

To ensure the generalizability of the RF models, the following measures were taken:

* The dataset was split into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for validation. This allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data and helps to prevent overfitting.
* The Optuna algorithm was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the RF models. This involves automatically searching the hyperparameter space to find the combination that minimizes the mean squared error.

There is no mention of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting in the provided context. However, the use of a validation set and hyperparameter optimization can help to improve the generalizability of the RF models.
