I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the experiment's setup, results, and comparisons between different frontends and techniques, but it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
