The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models and their applications in water quality prediction, discussing various parameters such as conductivity, BOD, nitrate, and DO. It also mentions the use of Python libraries like Lazy Predict, which automates machine learning and offers 40 ML models. However, there is no mention of specific data formats like image, audio, video, or CSV.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the data is related to water quality parameters, but the format of the data is not specified. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
