The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the model training, evaluation, and selection process, but it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps.

However, based on the context, we can infer that some metrics calculation was involved, as the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores of the models are presented in Table 6. Additionally, the F1-scores of the five categories across all networks are displayed in Fig. 4. 

But, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, confusion matrix, or any other techniques. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
