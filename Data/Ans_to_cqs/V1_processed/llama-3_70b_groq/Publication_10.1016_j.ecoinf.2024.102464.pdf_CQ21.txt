Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the species distribution model, its variables, and the correlation analysis conducted to enhance predictive performance and mitigate overfitting. It also discusses the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves of seven machine learning models, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
