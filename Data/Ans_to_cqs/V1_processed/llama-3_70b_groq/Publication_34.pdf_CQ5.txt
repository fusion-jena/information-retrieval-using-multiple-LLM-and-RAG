The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context only mentions the use of the ESDBv2 Raster Library, which is a set of rasters derived from the European Soil Database distribution v2.0, but it does not specify the exact dataset used for training the deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, or any other specific dataset was used.
