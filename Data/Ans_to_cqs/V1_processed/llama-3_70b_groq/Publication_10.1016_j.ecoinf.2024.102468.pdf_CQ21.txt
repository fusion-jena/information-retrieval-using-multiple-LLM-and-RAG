I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context only discusses the training stage of the HMM model, where the model parameters are estimated, and the comparison of the WT-HMM model's performance with varying dataset sizes. It does not provide information about any postprocessing steps that may be involved after the model training.
