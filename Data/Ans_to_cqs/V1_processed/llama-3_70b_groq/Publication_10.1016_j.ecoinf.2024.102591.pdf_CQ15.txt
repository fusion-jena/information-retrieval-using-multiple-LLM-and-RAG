I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the FIREMAP workflow, the BA algorithm, and the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for remote sensing data processing. It discusses the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms, but does not provide details on the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
