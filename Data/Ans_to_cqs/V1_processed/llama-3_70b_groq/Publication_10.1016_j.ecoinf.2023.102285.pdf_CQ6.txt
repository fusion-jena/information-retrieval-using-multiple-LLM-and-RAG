Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, datasets, and experimental design for detecting man-made underwater objects and marine small natural objects. It discusses the computational complexity, processing time, and evaluation phases of the model, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular study. If you need information on common preprocessing steps in deep learning, I can provide general information, but it would not be specific to this study.
