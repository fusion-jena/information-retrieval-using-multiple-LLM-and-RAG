Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the training process, data augmentation, transfer learning, and the comparison of CNNs with OBIA in terms of user productivity and accuracy. It does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
