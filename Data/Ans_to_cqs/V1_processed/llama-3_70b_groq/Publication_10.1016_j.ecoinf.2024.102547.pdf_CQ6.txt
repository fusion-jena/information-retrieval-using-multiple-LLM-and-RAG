Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on acoustic data analysis using functional data analysis (FDA) techniques, and it discusses dimension reduction, aggregated data modeling, and empirical covariance functions. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. If you're looking for general information on common preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I can provide some general information. Typically, preprocessing steps may include normalization, scaling, feature scaling, data cleaning, handling missing values, and data transformation. However, the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture.
