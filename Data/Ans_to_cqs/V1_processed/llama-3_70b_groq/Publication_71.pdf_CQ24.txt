The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention data augmentation as a potential strategy to work with imbalanced datasets, which can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training data. Data augmentation involves applying transformations to the training data, such as flipping, rotating, or adding noise, to increase the size and diversity of the dataset. This can help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting.

Additionally, the context provides a table of training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, which includes parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and weight decay. These parameters can affect the randomness of the model's behavior, but they are not directly related to handling randomness in the pipeline.

In general, strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines may include setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting, and using ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random initializations. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, while the context mentions data augmentation as a strategy to work with imbalanced datasets, it does not provide specific information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
