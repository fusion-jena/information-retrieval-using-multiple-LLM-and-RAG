According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Horizontal flipping: All images were horizontally flipped to obtain the final training dataset (T0).
2. Contrast adjustment: Each "natural" image yielded 4 more images with increased contrast (120% and 140%) and 2 with decreased contrast (80% and 60%).

There is no mention of other data augmentation techniques such as rotating or scaling in the provided context.
