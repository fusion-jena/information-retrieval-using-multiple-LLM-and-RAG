The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the same DL architecture is trained with the same hyper-parameters in experiments 1 and 2, but it does not provide information on how these hyper-parameters were chosen or optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
