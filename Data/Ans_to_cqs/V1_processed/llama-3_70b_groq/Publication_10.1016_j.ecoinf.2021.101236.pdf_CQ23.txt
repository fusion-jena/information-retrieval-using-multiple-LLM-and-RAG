The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model follows current best practices in deep learning, which are well summarized in (Chollet, 2017). 

One measure that can be inferred is the use of data augmentation, which is enabled by the 3-s window length. This suggests that the training data was diversified, which can help improve the model's generalizability. 

Beyond this, the context does not provide further information on measures taken to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.
