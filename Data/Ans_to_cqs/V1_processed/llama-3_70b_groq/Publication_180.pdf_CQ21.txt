Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the calibration of the deep learning model using TensorFlow for automated species identification of Triatominae, a vector of Chagas disease. It discusses the optimization of training steps and processing time for Mexican and Brazilian species datasets. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that may be involved after the model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
