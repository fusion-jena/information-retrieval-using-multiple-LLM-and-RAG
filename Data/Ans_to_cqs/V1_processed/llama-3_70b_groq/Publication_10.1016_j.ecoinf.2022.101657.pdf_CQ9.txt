The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the GBIF database contains over 2300 videos of animals, and a curated subset of 330 videos has been used for the pipeline. It is also mentioned that the training and validation datasets are provided, but the repository where they are stored is not specified. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact repository where the data is stored (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF).
