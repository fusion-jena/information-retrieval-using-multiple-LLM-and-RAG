Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily focuses on various machine learning and signal processing techniques, including neural networks, genetic programming, wavelet analysis, and entropy maximization. While it mentions the use of deep learning approaches and neural networks, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in these pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
