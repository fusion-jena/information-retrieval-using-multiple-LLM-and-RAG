The context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework is used to build the model. It only mentions the use of TensorBoard for monitoring the experiments, which is a visualization tool that can be used with various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. However, it does not provide enough information to determine the specific framework used in this case.
