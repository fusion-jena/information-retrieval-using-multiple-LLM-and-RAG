Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the feasibility of using small datasets to train deep learning models, the architecture of the AlexNet model, and the training parameters used. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
