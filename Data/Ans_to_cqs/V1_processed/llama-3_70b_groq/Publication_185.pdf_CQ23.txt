Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only mentions that the experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation, and that the models were trained and validated on this dataset. It also mentions that the butterfly specimen data sets were standardized, but it does not provide further information on how the dataset was prepared or split for training and validation.

Therefore, I don't know what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
