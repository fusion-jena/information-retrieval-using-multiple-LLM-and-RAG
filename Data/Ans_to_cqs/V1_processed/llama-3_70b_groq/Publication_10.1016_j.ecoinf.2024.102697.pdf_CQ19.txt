I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions a study on model complexity, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian Optimization, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used for building the deep learning model. The references cited in the context are related to different studies on machine learning methods, but they do not provide information on the frameworks used. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning model.
