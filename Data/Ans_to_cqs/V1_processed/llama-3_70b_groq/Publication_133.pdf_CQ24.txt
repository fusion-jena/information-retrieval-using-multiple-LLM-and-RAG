Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of a deep learning algorithm to insect identification in a forest ecology research setting.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to employ strategies to handle randomness, such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting
* Implementing data augmentation to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset
* Averaging model predictions over multiple runs with different random initializations

These strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, and therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given information.
