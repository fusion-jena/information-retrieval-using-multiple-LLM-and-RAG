I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research articles related to plant physiology, agriculture, and remote sensing, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
