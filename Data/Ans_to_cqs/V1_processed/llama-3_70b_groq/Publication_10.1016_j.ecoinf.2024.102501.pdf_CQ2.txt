The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the prediction of dissolved oxygen concentration in water using machine learning and deep learning methods, and it mentions various studies and models used for this purpose. However, it does not provide information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

The only mention of data is in the phrase "dataset as listed in Table 1," but it does not specify the format of the dataset. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
