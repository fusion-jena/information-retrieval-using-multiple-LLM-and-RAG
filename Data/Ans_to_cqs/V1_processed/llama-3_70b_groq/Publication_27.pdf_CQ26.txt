The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it appears to be a collection of Unicode characters, possibly representing mathematical equations or symbols, and some text fragments that seem to be unrelated to the query.

Based on general knowledge, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution to ensure that the model is not biased towards a particular class.
2. Oversampling: This involves creating additional instances of the underrepresented class to balance the class distribution.
3. Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of instances of the overrepresented class to balance the class distribution.
4. Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from diverse sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenario.

It is essential to address data bias during preprocessing to ensure that the deep learning model is fair and accurate. However, without more specific information or context, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.

Note: The provided context does not provide any specific information about the techniques used to address data bias, so the answer is based on general knowledge.
