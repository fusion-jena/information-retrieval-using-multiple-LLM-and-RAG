The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "accuracy enhancement" and "overall classification accuracy" in the text, suggesting that accuracy might be one of the metrics used. Additionally, it mentions "OA" and "kappa" in Table 5, which are likely referring to Overall Accuracy and Cohen's Kappa coefficient, respectively. These are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models. 

However, it does not provide information on other common metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy, OA, and kappa are likely used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, but the exact set of metrics used is not fully specified in the provided context.
