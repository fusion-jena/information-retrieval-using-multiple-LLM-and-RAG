The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets commonly used in deep learning such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing machine learning approaches, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM), for species distribution modeling using camera trap data. The datasets mentioned are camera trap datasets, but they are not typical deep learning datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
