I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deploying a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on machine learning models, specifically covariance-weighted bagging, and geostatistical simulations, but it does not provide information on deploying a trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
