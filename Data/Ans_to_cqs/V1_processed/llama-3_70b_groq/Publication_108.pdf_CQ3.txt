The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the orthophotos were divided into small labeled tiles (or small image cubes) and fed into the CNN, but it does not specify how these labels were created or what type of annotation was used. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in this study.
