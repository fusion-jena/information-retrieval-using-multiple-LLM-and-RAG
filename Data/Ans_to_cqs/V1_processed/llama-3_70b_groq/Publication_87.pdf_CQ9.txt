I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the use of deep learning for species identification in ecological communities, provides a reproducible example of the workflow, and cites several references, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
