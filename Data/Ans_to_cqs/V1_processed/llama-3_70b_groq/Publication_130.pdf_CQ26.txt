Based on the provided context, the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Oversampling: This technique is used to balance the dataset by creating duplicates of the minority class. In the context, oversampling was restricted to the training dataset and not applied to the validation dataset to avoid overestimating the model's learning progress.

2. Data augmentation: This technique is used to artificially increase the sample size by applying transformations to an existing set of images. This helps to increase the training sample and reduce overfitting.

3. Diverse data collection: The context mentions photographing animals across different times of the day and in different lighting conditions to capture a broad range of contexts. This helps to ensure that the training dataset contains sufficient variation to capture the broad range of contexts that the CNN is required for.

There is no mention of stratified splitting or undersampling in the provided context.
