The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is Stratiﬁed Cross-Validation. This is mentioned in the context as "Stratiﬁed cross-validation was used, and evaluated with Precision, Recall and F-measure." This approach is used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms and to avoid overfitting or biased results due to the specific partitioning of the dataset.
