The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are:

* DeepWeeds: a multiclass weed species image dataset for deep learning.
* CropAndWeed dataset (Steininger et al., 2023): contains 43,814 plant images, with 8,034 labeled images.
* Olaniyi et al. (2023) dataset: contains 36,374 RGB images from maize farmlands, with 500 annotated images and 5,764 bounding box instances.

These datasets are specific to weed and crop recognition tasks and are not general-purpose datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
