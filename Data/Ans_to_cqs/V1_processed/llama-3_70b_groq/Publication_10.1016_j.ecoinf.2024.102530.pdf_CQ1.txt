Based on the provided context, it appears that the study utilizes a combination of datasets and sources to collect raw data. These include:

1. Land Use/Land Cover Map (LULC) data from MELCCFP, Q, 2022, which is a raster dataset with a 10m resolution.
2. Weather data, which is collected daily with a 2.5 km resolution.
3. Database of parcels and declared agricultural production (BDPPAD), which is a vector dataset that provides information on agricultural parcels and production.
4. Geobase of the Quebec hydrographic network (GRHQ), which is a vector dataset that provides information on hydrographic features.
5. Geobase Adresses Quebec, which is a vector dataset that provides information on addresses in Quebec.
6. MNT-Lidar data, which is a raster dataset with a 1m resolution.
7. Survey data from beekeepers in Quebec, which is mentioned in the supplementary material (Table S1.2).

It does not appear that sensors are used to collect raw data in this study. Instead, the study relies on existing datasets and surveys to collect the necessary information.
