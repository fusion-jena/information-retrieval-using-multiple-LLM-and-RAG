Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the dataset, annotator reliability, and the methodology used for training the CNN architectures, but it does not specify the annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
