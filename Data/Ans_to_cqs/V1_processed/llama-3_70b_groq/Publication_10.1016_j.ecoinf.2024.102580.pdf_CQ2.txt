The context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that image data is used, as the study involves aerial imagery and semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping. The availability of 2012 aerial imagery data is also mentioned, which suggests that image data is involved. However, it is not clear if other data formats like audio, video, or CSV are used in the pipeline.
