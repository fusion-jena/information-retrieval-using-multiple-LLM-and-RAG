The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in various domains, such as karyotyping images of chromosomes, sectioned brain microvasculature, and network data.

However, it does mention the importance of obtaining enough ground truth data, which is a crucial step in addressing data bias. The context also mentions the use of crowd-sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation, as a way to obtain high-quality data.

It does not provide specific information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
