The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different neural network architectures (CNN, ViT, ResNet) and their applications in image classification tasks, particularly in the context of microorganism and Cervidae classification.

The discussion revolves around the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture, such as the ability to extract local information, handle vanishing or exploding gradients, and learn features from input images. The context also introduces the CA-Hybrid network, which integrates CAM into the residual structure of ResNet for improved classification performance.

However, it does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
