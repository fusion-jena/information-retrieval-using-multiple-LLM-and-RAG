Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the methodology of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and its application in species distribution modeling (SDM). It discusses the architecture of the CNN, the concept of convolution, and the performance of the CNN-based model in comparison to the BIOCLIM model.

However, it can be inferred that the study involves the use of satellite-based observations, as mentioned in the context. This suggests that the raw data might be collected through remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery. Additionally, the study is conducted in the foothills of the Himalayas, which implies that the data collection might involve field observations or surveys. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In conclusion, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
