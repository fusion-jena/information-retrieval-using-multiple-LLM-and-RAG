Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of satellite imagery and remote sensing data. For instance, the paper by Hanintyo et al. (2021) mentions the use of Landsat 8 data for retrieving chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter over Wangi-Wangi Island, Indonesia. Similarly, the paper by Cao et al. (2023) uses time-series satellite imagery for lake total suspended matter retrieval. 

Additionally, the context suggests that geostationary satellite ocean color data may also be used for collecting raw data, as mentioned in the paper by He et al. (2013). However, there is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for raw data collection in the provided context. It is also possible that sensors may be used, but this is not explicitly mentioned.
