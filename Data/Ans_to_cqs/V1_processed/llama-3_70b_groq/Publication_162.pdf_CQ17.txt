Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on object detection, image recognition, and classification tasks using various deep learning architectures and techniques. It does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of pre-trained weights and normalization techniques, which can help prevent overfitting to some extent. For instance, the normalization of input channels by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation can help reduce overfitting. Additionally, using pre-trained weights can also help prevent overfitting by leveraging knowledge from larger datasets.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. If you need information on regularization methods, you may need to refer to other resources or literature.
