The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on transfer learning, domain adaptation, and improving learning by restricting overconfidence. It discusses approaches like IFTL and FTL, but does not delve into regularization methods for deep learning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
