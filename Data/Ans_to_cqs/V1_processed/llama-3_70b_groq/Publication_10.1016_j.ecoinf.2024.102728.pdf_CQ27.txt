Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on data sources, methodology description, and references related to ecology, archaeology, and remote sensing. There is no mention of model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
