The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the model is used for classification tasks. 

In section 2.4.4, it is mentioned that for binary classification, a dense layer with a single output is used, and Ïƒ is employed as the activation function. For tasks involving more than two classes, the dense layer has multiple outputs, and the softmax function is used as the activation function. This suggests that the model is designed to perform classification tasks, but the specific classification problem is not mentioned. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the BLS entropy profile to characterize the swimming behavior of C. elegans, and the model is used to assess water quality. Therefore, it can be inferred that the model is likely used to classify the swimming behavior of C. elegans into different categories or to classify the water quality into different levels based on the swimming behavior. However, without more information, the exact purpose of the model cannot be determined.
