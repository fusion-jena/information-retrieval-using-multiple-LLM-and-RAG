I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to the architecture and design of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
