I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing a statistical analysis of the explanatory power of driver factors on the spatial variability of kNDVI, using a Q statistic calculated from variance components. There is no mention of deep learning, datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
