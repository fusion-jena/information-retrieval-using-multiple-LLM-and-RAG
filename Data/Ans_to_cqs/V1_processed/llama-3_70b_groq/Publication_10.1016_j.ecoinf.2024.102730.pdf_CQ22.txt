The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination (r2). These metrics are mentioned in the context as the standard metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall, which are typically used for classification tasks.
