The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. According to the text, "To test for model performance, we employed cross-validation by using 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the other 30% as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy." This means that the model is trained on 70% of the data and its performance is evaluated on the remaining 30% of the data. The accuracy of the model is then measured using the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristic Curve (AUC), which ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with higher values indicating better model performance.
