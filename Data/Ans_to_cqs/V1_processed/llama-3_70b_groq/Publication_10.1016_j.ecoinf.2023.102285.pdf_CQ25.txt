The purpose of the deep learning model is detection, specifically for detecting man-made underwater objects (MMOs) and human activity types from 3D posture data. This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of deep learning models for detecting MMOs in underwater imagery and robots or sonography, as well as detecting human activity types from 3D posture data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a contour-based features analysis method to discern underwater MMOs from natural environments, and a DL technique titled LCSE-ResNet to detect, classify, and locate vessels and oil platforms based on remote optical imagery.
