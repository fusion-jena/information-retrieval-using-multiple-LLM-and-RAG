I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning in insect ecoinformatics, provides references to various research papers, and explains the performance of a model in identifying insect species. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
