Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of different embedding models, transfer learning, and active learning strategies for bird species classification.

However, it can be inferred that the models used in the context, such as VGG16, ResNet152-V2, VGGish, YAMNet, and BirdNet, are likely to have undergone some preprocessing steps, as they are pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet and AudioSet.

Typically, preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation. However, without explicit information, it is difficult to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this context.

In general, normalization and scaling are common preprocessing steps to ensure that the input data is in a suitable range for the model. Cleaning the data by removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information is also crucial. Data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, can be applied to increase the diversity of the training data.

Without further information, it is impossible to provide a more specific answer to this query.
