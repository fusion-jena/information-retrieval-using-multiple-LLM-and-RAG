The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly mentioned in the context, which describes the baseline model as a "simple CNN architecture" with two convolutional layers, followed by max pooling, a flattening operation, and two fully-connected layers.
