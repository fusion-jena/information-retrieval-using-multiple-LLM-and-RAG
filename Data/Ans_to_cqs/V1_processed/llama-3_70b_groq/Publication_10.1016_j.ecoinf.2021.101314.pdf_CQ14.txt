I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the method's requirements for setting several parameters, such as thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions and the length and complexity of their queries. It also explains the specific choices made for these parameters in the experiments, but it does not provide information on how these parameters were optimized.
