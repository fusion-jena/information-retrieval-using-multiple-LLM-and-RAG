The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used for classifying motion detection frames in videos to identify hummingbird visitation events. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of images collected for each class, and it is used to classify frames extracted from videos using motion detection. The goal is to reduce false positives in the classification of hummingbird visitation events.
