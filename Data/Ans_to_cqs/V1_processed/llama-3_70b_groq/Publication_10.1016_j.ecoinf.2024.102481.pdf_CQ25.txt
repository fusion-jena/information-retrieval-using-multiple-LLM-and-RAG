The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is classification. Specifically, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to classify the maturity of Chilean hake fish, distinguishing between immature and mature-inactive females. The model is trained to predict the reproductive condition of the fish based on input features, and its performance is evaluated against the gold-standard of histological staging. The goal is to provide an accurate and reliable method for determining the maturity of fish, which is essential for their management and conservation in the ecosystem.
