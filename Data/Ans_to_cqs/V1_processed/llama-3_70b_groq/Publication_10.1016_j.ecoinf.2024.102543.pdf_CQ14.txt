Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text only mentions that the validation set is utilized during training to fine-tune hyperparameters, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
