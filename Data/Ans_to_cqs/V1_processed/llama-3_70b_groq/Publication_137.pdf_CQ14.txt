Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the experimental results of the model with different hyperparameter settings, such as regularization strength, voxel size, and batch size, but it does not provide information on the optimization method used to find the best hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
