Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It provides information about the model architecture, training process, and some hyperparameter values, but it does not specify the method used to optimize the hyperparameters, such as grid search, random search, or any other method. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
