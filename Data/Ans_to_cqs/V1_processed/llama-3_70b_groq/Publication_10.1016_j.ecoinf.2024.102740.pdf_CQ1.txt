Based on the provided context, it appears that remote sensing techniques are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May are used as input data for the Random Forest (RF) technique. This suggests that the raw data is collected through remote sensing images, which are then processed and used for training machine learning models. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context.
