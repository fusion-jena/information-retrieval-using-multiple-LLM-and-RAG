I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The text appears to be discussing a citizen science project that uses a mobile app to collect biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers. It mentions the use of a custom species list and post-dive interviews to collect data, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
