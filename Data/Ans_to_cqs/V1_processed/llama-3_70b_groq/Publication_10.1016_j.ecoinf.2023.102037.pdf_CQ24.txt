Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be focused on image classification, particularly in the context of crop pests, and discusses various aspects of data splitting, image tiling, and model performance. It does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "random data splitting" as a weak validation procedure that can lead to overestimation of model performance. This suggests that randomness can be a concern in the deep learning pipeline, but it does not provide specific strategies for handling it.

In general, strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines may include setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques such as cross-validation, or employing regularization methods to reduce overfitting. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.
