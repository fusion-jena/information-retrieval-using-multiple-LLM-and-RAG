I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training. The context discusses the PLUS model, which consists of two main modules: the transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). It also mentions the CASA model, which is used to estimate NPP. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
