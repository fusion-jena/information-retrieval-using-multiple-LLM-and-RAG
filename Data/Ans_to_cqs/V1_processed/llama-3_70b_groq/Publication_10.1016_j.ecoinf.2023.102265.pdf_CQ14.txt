I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of the proposed method compared to softmax, cites several research papers, and presents some results, but it does not provide information about hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or another method is used for hyperparameter optimization.
