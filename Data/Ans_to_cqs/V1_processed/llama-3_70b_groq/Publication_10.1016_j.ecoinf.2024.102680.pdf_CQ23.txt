Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors employed mosaic data augmentation as a preprocessing step to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. This technique helps to make the distribution of the input data more uniform, which can improve the model's ability to represent the data and enhance its performance during training. However, there is no mention of other measures such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability.
