Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, hyperparameter settings, and the choice of optimizer and learning rate. It does not provide information on data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
