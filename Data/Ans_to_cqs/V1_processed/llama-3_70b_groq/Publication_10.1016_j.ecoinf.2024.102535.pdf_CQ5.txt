The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the work investigates the application of state-of-the-art network architectures, originally employed in the classification of non-seabed images, for the task of hydrothermal vent substrata image classification. It implies that the dataset used is a collection of deep-sea images, but it does not specify the name of the dataset. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the datasets used are MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, or something else.
