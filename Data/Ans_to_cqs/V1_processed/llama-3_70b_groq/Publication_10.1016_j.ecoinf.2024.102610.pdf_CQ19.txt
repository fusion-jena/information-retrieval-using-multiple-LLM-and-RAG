I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. The context discusses various machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious disease and disease vector abundance, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context mentions R packages such as caret, VSURF, and pdp, which are used for machine learning and data analysis, but it does not provide information on deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
