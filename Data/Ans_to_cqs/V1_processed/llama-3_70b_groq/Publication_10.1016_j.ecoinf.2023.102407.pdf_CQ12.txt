I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep neural networks, but it does not specify the architecture of these models (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context focuses on the use of teacher-student structures, pseudo-labeling, and ensemble methods for species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used.
