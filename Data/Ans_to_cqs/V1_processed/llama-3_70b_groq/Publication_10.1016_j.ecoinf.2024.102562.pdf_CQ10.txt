I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the research. The text only mentions the use of the Mask-RCNN algorithm and references several other research papers, but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to the code repository.
