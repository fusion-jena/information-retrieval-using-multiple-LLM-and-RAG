I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the overall process, the architecture of the ResNet model, and the training data, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
