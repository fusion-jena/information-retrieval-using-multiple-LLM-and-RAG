The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It appears to focus on the analysis of large-scale acoustic data, specifically in the context of urban acoustic ecology. The text mentions the use of audio recordings from 23 different sites in Bochum, Germany, but it does not provide information on how these recordings were collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It is possible that the data was collected using sensors or audio recorders, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, there is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for data collection.
