The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as being available on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, it is mentioned that "All data and scripts are continuously updated on the ITINERIS Critical Zone Virtual Research Environment available on the D4Science e-Infrastructure". This suggests that the code repository is available on the D4Science e-Infrastructure, but it requires free registration to the platform and the Virtual Research Environment.
