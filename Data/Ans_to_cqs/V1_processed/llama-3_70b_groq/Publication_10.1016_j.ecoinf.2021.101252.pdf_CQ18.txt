The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of validation data (Bv) and measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The model's validation performance is monitored during training, and the 'optimal' number of training epochs is determined as the one that provides the best validation performance. Additionally, the training is stopped if no increase in validation performance is observed after 25 epochs. This approach helps to identify the optimal number of training epochs and prevents overfitting or underfitting of the model.
