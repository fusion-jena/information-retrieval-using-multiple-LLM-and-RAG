The provided context does not mention the use of a specific deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) in the pipeline. The text only mentions the use of machine learning techniques in general, but does not provide details on the specific type of model used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
