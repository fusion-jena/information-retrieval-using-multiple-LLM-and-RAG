The context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in the future. Therefore, it can be inferred that CNN and RCNN are potential deep learning models that may be used in the pipeline, but it is not clear if they are currently being used.
