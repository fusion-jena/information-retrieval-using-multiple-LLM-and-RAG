I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to biodiversity and marine ecosystems, discussing datasets and repositories such as GBIF, OBIS, and FishBase, which contain information on species occurrences, taxonomy, and ecology. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision-related topics. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
