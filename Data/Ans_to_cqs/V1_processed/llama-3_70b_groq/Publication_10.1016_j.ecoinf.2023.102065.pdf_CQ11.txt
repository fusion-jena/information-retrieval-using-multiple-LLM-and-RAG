I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various topics related to deep learning, acoustic data, and bird diversity, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The references cited in the context are mostly academic papers and do not include a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
