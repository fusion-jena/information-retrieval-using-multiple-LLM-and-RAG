The context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). However, it does mention that Python 3.8.0 and Jupyter Notebook v6.4.5 were used for image processing, and U-Net training was carried out on a high-performance computing resource. This suggests that Python was used as the programming language, but the specific deep learning framework is not mentioned.
