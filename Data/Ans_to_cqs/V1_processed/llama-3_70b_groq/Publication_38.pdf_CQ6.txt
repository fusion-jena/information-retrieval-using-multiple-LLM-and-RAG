Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and application of deep learning models, specifically CNNFAST, for bat acoustic signal detection and environmental sound classification.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed on the input spectrograms, as the context mentions the input spectrogram being processed by the CNNFAST network. But the specific preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in this context.
