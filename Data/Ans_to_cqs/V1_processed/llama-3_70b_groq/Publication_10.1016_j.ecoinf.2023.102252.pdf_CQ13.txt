I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be related to a model called FERM, which is not a deep learning model, and its parameters are listed in Table 1. These parameters are related to ecological modeling and do not include typical deep learning hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
