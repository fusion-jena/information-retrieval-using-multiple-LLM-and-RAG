I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. It discusses Wikiloc, a platform for outdoor trails, and word embedding techniques such as Word2vec, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
