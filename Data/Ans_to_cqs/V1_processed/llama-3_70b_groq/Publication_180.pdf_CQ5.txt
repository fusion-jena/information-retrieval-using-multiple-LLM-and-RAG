The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors used their own datasets consisting of digital images of triatomine species. Specifically, they used 405 images for Mexican triatomine species and 1,584 images for Brazilian triatomine species. These datasets were used to train a deep learning algorithm using TensorFlow for automated species identification.
