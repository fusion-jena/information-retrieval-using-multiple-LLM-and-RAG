The context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Instead, it mentions the use of traditional machine learning models like XGB, RF, and ET, which are fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning techniques. Additionally, a stacking-based ANN meta ML model is built using these models. However, it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
