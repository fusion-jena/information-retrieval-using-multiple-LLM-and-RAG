Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on active learning, prototypical learning, and transfer learning in the context of a recommender system for annotating ecological audio data. It discusses the ranking of samples based on certainty, fine-tuning of the feature extraction model, and updating class prototypes. However, it does not address randomness or random seed values in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
