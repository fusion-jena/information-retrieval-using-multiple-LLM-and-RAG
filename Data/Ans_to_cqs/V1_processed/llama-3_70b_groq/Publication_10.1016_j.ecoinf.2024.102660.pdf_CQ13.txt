The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: 

* Batch size: 8
* Initial learning rate: 0.001
* Learning rate adjustment strategy: StepLR, halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration
* Number of epochs: 120

These hyperparameters are mentioned in the section 2.5. Parameter setting of the provided context. However, the optimizer used in the model is not explicitly mentioned.
