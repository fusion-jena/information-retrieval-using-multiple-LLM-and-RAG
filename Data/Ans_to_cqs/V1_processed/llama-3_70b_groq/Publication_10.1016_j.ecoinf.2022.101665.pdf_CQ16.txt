The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of thematic map accuracy using different methods, including k-fold cross-validation, and the calculation of metrics such as RMSE and MEC.

However, it is common in machine learning to use validation metrics, such as validation loss, to determine when training is complete. A plateau in validation loss is often used as a criterion to stop training, as it indicates that the model is no longer improving its performance on the validation set.

Since this information is not provided in the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided text.
