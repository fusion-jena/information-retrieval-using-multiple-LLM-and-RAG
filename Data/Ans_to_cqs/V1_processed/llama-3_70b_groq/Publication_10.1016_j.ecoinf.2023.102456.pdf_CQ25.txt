I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of a neural network to learn the neighbourhood relationship Rk, which is used to improve the results of a model, but it does not specify what task the model is performing (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). The context appears to be related to forest fire simulation or prediction, but the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not clear.
