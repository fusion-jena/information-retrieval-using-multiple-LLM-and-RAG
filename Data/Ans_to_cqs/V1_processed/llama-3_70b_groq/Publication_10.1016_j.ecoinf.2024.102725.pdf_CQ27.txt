I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be related to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction and vegetation cover studies, but it does not provide information on model deployment. The papers cited discuss various techniques for reconstructing NDVI time series, such as harmonic analysis, Savitzky-Golay filter, and deep-learning enhanced fusion methods, but they do not mention the deployment process of a trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
