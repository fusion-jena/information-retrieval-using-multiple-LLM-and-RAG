I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article that discusses various aspects of a project, including author contributions, data availability, acknowledgments, and references. However, it does not provide information on how data bias was addressed during preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
