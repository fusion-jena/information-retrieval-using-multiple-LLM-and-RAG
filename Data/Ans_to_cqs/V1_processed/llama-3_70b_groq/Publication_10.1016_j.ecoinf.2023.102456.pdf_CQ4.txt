I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to machine learning, forest fires, and cellular automata, but it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
