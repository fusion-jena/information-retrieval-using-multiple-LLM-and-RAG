I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. It discusses various topics related to deep learning, such as the use of GPU computing, machine learning applications, and software tools like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. However, it does not provide information about a specific pipeline or the type of deep learning model used in it. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
