The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the model was trained for a fixed number of epochs (10 epochs) and that the error rate, validation loss, and training loss were monitored during training. 

In the first training phase, the model achieved an error rate of 0.1538 at epoch 5, and in the final fine-tuned model, the training was stopped after 10 epochs with a validation loss of 0.1446. 

Although it is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the training was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than based on a specific criterion such as a validation loss plateau.
