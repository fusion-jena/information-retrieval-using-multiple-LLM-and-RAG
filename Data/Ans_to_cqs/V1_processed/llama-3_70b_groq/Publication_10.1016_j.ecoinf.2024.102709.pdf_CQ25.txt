The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, specifically bounding box estimation. This is evident from the mention of YOLO (You Only Look Once) training losses and mAP50 values, which are commonly used metrics in object detection tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Intersection over Union (IoU) and distributional focal loss (DFL) to measure the error in predicted bounding box coordinates and dimensions, further supporting the object detection purpose.
