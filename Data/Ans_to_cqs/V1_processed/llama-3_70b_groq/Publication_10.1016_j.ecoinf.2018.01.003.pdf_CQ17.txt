Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the development of neural networks, including Bayesian learning machines and deep learning, as well as the application of neural networks in various fields. It also provides some mathematical formulations for neural networks, but it does not discuss regularization methods.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the issue of overfitting in the context of BPNN7-1, which suggests that the authors are aware of the problem of overfitting in neural networks. Nevertheless, the context does not provide information on how to prevent overfitting using regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
