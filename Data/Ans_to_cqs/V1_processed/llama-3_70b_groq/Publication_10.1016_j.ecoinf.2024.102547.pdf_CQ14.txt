I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a study on marine ecological studies, and it provides various metrics and results from different models, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
