Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly YOLOv5, for detecting alates on sorghum leaves, and discusses the dataset splitting ratio, characteristics of deep learning models, and the computing environment used. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques employed during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
