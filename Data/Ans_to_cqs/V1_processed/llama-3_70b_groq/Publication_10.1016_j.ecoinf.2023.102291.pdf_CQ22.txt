According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy: It is the proportion of all correct predictions.
2. Precision: It is the number of true positives divided by true positives and false positives.
3. Sensitivity (or Recall): It is not explicitly defined in the context, but it is mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Specificity: It is mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the model's performance, but its definition is not provided in the context.
5. F1 score: It is mentioned as a metric used to compare the performance of different models.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the ResNet152V2 model and the custom CNN model in detecting sounds with SNR > 1.
