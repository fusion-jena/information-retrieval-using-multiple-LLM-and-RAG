The context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it provides a link to the GitHub repository of YOLOv5 (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/v4.0), which is a popular object detection model. YOLOv5 is typically implemented using PyTorch. Therefore, it can be inferred that PyTorch might be the framework used to build the deep learning model, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
