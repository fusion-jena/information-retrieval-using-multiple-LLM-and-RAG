None of the provided context mentions the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. In fact, the context states that the artificial neural network was built using MATLAB R2014b, which is a different platform altogether. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model was not built using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other popular deep learning frameworks.
