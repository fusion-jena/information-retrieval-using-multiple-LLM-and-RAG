Unfortunately, I don't know the answer to this query. The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the author thanks Google engineers for sharing code samples and answering questions on deploying machine learning models, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository. Additionally, it mentions that a DeepMeerkat executable is available for Mac and Windows, but it does not provide a link to the code repository.
