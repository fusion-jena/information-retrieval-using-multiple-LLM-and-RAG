Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred from the hand-crafted feature extraction experiment that the data is split into training and testing sets based on the specimens, not individual images. This means that all images of a given specimen are either used for training or testing, but not both.

In the biased dataset, 70% of the data is randomly taken for training and 30% for testing, but this is done at the species level, not individual images. For example, if a species has 20 photos, 14 will go to the training dataset and 6 to the testing dataset. This approach is similar to previous plant identification studies.

However, it is not clear if this same approach is used for the deep learning experiment. The context only mentions that the data is resized to 224x224 pixels before running the network, but it does not specify how the data is split into training, testing, and validation sets. Therefore, the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly stated.
