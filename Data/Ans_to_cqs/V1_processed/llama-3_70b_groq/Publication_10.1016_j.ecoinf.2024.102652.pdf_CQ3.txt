The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that semantic segmentation is applied to the image via the MU-NET deep learning method, which involves assigning a category label to each pixel of an image. However, it does not specify the annotation techniques used to prepare the data for this process.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, as this information is not provided in the given context.
