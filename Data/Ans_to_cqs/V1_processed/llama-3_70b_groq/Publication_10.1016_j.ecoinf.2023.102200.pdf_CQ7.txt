Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on individual tree segmentation using LiDAR data and deep learning methods, citing various research papers and presenting results from experiments. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria for model training.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, k-fold cross-validation, and time-series splitting, among others. However, without specific information from the context, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
