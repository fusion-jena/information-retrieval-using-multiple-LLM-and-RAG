Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context provides information about the accuracy of different models on raw and pre-processed datasets, confusion matrices, and color space conversions, but it does not discuss the specific strategy used to monitor model performance during training.

However, based on the provided tables, it can be inferred that the model performance is being monitored using accuracy as a metric, and the performance is being evaluated on training, validation, and test sets. This is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate the model's performance during training, but the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the performance is not mentioned.
