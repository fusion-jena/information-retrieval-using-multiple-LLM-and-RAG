The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning models. The text discusses various models and architectures, such as 3DCNN-LSTM, CRNN, Soundception, ACGAN, and PPNN, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
