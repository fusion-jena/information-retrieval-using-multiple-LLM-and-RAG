The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, batch normalization, and average pooling. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that batch normalization, which is mentioned in the context, can help reduce internal covariate shift, which can be related to data bias. But this is not a direct technique to address data bias during preprocessing.

To answer the query, I would say that I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing based on the provided context. The context does not provide sufficient information to answer this question.
