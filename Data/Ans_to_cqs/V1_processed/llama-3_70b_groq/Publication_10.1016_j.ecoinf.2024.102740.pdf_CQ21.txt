Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process using Random Forest (RF) technique, hyperparameter tuning, and data preparation. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
