The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that LRs (likely referring to learning rates) were trained and optimized using a grid search tool implemented in scikit-learn on the validation set. There is no mention of validation loss plateau or any other criteria used to determine the completion of training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
