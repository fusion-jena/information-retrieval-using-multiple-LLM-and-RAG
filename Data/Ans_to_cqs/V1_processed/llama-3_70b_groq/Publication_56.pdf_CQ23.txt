The context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that 70% of the data were used for training the algorithms whereas the remaining 30% were used only for validation. This suggests that the model was validated on a separate dataset, which is a common practice to ensure the model's performance on unseen data. However, it does not provide information on whether the dataset was diverse, or if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.
