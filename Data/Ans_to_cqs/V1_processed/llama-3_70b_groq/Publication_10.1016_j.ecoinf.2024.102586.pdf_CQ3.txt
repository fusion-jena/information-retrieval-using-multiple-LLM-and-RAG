I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, discussing the analysis of invasive plant species and the use of random forest models to examine the importance of environmental and anthropogenic variables on species richness and abundance. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision-related concepts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
