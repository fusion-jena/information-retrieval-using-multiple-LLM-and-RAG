Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text explains the general process of training a deep learning (DL) model, including the use of annotated data and an optimization process to adjust the model's parameters. However, it does not specify the method used to optimize the hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
