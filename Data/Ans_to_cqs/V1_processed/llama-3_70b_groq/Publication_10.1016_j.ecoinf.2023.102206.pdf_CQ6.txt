Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on transfer learning, intuitionistic fuzzy transfer learning, and its application to predict GDP using CO2 emission data. It discusses the challenges of transfer learning, such as overconfidence and hesitancy, and proposes a novel approach to address these issues. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
