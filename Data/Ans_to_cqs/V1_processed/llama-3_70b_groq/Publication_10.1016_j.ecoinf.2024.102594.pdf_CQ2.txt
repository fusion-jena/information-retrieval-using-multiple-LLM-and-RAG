Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are TIF (Tagged Image File) and SHP (Shapefile). The TIF format is used for storing the classification results predicted by the DeepLabV3+ algorithm, while the SHP format is used for storing the segmentation results obtained from MRS (Multi-Resolution Segmentation). There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV formats being used in the pipeline. The input data to the pipeline appears to be remote sensing images, which are cut into regular image blocks of size 32x32 pixels for training and validation.
