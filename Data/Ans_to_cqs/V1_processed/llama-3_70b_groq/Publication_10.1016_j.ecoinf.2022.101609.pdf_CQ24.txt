Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on air quality, pollutants, and the application of deep learning models for prediction and estimation. It discusses the evaluation of a deep learning model, its training and validation losses, and the importance of selecting an appropriate evaluation metric. However, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
