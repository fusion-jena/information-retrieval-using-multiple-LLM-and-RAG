The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that the value of k for the k-NN classifier was fixed as k = 4, as this value yielded the best performance after testing several values. This suggests that the hyperparameter tuning was done through a simple iterative process of testing different values, but the exact method (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
