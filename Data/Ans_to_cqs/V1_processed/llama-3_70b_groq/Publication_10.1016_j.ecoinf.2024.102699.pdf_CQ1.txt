The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It focuses on the data augmentation techniques used to improve the classification performance of the bird species classification models. The context mentions the use of the bird audio detection data set from the DCASE challenge, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

It can be inferred that the raw data might have been collected through audio recordings, possibly using sensors or audio recorders, but this is not explicitly stated. Additionally, there is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for data collection.

Therefore, I don't know the exact methods used for collecting raw data in this specific deep learning pipeline.
