The context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a 10-fold Cross Validation was performed to have a reliable estimate of the MSE on the test set. This implies that the data was split into folds, but the exact criteria or ratio for splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets is not provided.
