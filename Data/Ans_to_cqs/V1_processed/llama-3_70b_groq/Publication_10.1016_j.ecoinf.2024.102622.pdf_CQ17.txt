I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, vegetation indices, and crop classification using machine learning methods like random forest classification, support vector machine classification, and decision tree classification. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
