I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and geospatial applications, with discussions on machine learning models, parameter tuning, and data sources such as UAS imagery, airborne lidar, and Landsat data. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
