The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the text mentions that the model was trained with various combinations of four datasets, which are available in the Code and Data Availability section. The datasets seem to be related to bee flight activity recordings, with features such as the bee's age, daily number of flights, and total time spent outside daily.
