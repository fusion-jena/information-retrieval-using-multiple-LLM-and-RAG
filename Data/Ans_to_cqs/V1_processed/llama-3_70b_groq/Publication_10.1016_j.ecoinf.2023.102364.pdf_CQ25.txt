The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the provided information, it appears that the model is used for predicting gull-abundance hotspots and coldspots. This suggests that the model is likely used for regression or spatial prediction tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous value (in this case, gull abundance) across a geographic area. The model takes into account various socio-economic and environmental factors, such as distance to water, industrial areas, and impervious surfaces, to make these predictions.
