I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a description of a research study involving various machine learning models, including CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN, for daily streamflow forecasting. The context provides details about the model architectures, hyperparameters, and performance metrics, but it does not mention where the data repository is located. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
