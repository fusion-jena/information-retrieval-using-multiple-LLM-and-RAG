Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in the deep learning pipeline is primarily based on remote sensing data, specifically satellite imagery. The context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-based geoprocessing platform, which provides access to a large catalog of satellite imagery, including Landsat imagery. The study utilizes atmospherically corrected United States Geological Survey Landsat Surface reflectance products, which suggests that the raw data is collected through satellite remote sensing. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data.
