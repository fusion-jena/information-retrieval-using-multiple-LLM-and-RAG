The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to be discussing redescription mining, which is a technique that combines partitioning and modeling techniques to identify local patterns in data. It does not mention deep learning or the splitting of data for model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
