The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that region-specific models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal, which might suggest that the dataset was split based on location. This could be a form of stratified splitting, but it is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context does not mention cross-validation, diverse dataset, or any other measures commonly used to ensure generalizability. It only mentions that separate two-class models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal, and that preliminary trials showed that region-specific models performed better.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
