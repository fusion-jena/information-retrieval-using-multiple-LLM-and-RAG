According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model (Kaleidoscope) is evaluated using two metrics: precision and recall rate. 

Precision is estimated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by the software by the total number of ROIs (Regions of Interest) within the "Cow" cluster. This metric can be interpreted as an index of the percentage of ROIs correctly labeled by Kaleidoscope.

The recall rate is estimated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by Kaleidoscope by the number of cow calls present in the sound recordings. This metric is interpreted as an index of the percentage of calls that the recognizer is able to detect.

There is no mention of accuracy as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the model in the provided context.
