The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is used for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification to obtain LULC maps from satellite images. The model uses the Random Forest algorithm and is trained on a dataset of spectral bands, vegetation indices, soil indices, water indices, and cluster data. The goal is to classify the images into different LULC classes, such as artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forest, scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation, open spaces with little or no vegetation, and water bodies.
