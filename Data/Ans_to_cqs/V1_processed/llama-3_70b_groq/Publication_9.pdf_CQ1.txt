The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of images and image datasets in the context of ecology and evolutionary biology. It is likely that the raw data is collected through image capture using cameras or other imaging devices, possibly in the field or in a laboratory setting. 

The context also mentions the importance of high-resolution image datasets with segmentation mask annotations, which suggests that the raw data may be collected through manual or automated image capture processes. Additionally, it references a large-scale hierarchical image database called ImageNet, which could be a source of raw data for deep learning applications.

However, the context does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer to this query based on the provided context.
