Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be related to landscape architecture, urban design, and environmental performance evaluation, with references to papers on topics like 3D landscape indexes, visual landscape elements, and restorative potential. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
