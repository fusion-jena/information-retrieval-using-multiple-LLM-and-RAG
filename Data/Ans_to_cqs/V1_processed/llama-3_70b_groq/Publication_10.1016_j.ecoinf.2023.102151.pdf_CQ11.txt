I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. It discusses the integration of climate data, soil information, and remote sensing data, as well as the development of a unified visual language for communicating soil information across multidisciplinary professionals. However, it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
