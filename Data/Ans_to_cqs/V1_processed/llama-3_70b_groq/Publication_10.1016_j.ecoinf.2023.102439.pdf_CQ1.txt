Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve satellite data and direct ground-truth measurements. Specifically, the study derived the Land Surface Temperature (LST) dataset from infrared radiations measured on channels 31 and 32 using the MODIS-TERRA sensor. The data was obtained from the MOD11A2 product, which offers 8-day temporal and 1 km spatial resolutions covering 2005-2018. Additionally, the study used Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS NDBI data from 2014 to 2018. There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for raw data collection. However, it is possible that other methods may be used in the pipeline that are not mentioned in the provided context.
