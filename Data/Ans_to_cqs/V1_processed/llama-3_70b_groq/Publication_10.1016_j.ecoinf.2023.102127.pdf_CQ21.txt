The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that after specifying an engine and training the model, the resulting fit can be "visually interrogated, summarized, and validated" (Fig. 1). This suggests that some form of model evaluation or validation is possible, but the specific steps involved are not detailed.

It is also worth noting that the context highlights the importance of model evaluation, citing the challenges of evaluating models when integrating multiple datasets, and the need for appropriate validation metrics. However, it does not provide specific information on the postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
