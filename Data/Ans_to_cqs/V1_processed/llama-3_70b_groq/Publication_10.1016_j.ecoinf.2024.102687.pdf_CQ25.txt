The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically bird sound classification. The model is used to classify bird sounds into different categories. This is evident from the references to bird sound datasets, such as BirdNET, and the mention of bird sound classification in the text. The model is fine-tuned using a pretrained CNN backbone, such as DenseNet, to improve its performance on the classification task. The evaluation metrics used, such as DBCV, ARI, and AMI, also suggest that the model is being used for classification.
