I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the importance of attention mechanisms, feature extraction, and data augmentation in deep learning models, particularly in the context of plant identification. It also describes the proposed approach, SCAM-Herb model, and its components, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
