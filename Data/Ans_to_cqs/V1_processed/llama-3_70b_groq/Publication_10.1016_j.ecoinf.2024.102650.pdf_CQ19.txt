The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It discusses various techniques and models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the ERNIE model, but does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
