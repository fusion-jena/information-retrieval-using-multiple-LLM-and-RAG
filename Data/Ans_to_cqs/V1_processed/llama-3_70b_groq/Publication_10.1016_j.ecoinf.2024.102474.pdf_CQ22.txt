The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are MAD, OLS, EMD, SSIM, and ENS. These metrics are used to measure the similarity between the predicted and observed values. Specifically, EMD and OLS are computed based on the observed and predicted NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), while MAD and SSIM are computed on all RGBI (Red, Green, Blue, and Infrared) bands. The ENS score is a harmonic mean of the four score components (MAD, OLS, EMD, and SSIM) and should be maximized. These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance in predicting vegetation indices and other environmental variables.
