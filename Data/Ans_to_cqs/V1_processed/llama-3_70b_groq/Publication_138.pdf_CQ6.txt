The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It primarily focuses on the architecture of the ICSNet model, its layers, and their configurations. However, it does mention the use of Local Response Normalization (LRN) after the pooling layer and after the ninth layer, which is a form of normalization. 

It does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to this query based on the given context.
