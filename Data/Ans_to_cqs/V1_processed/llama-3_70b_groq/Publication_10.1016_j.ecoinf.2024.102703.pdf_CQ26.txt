I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. The context appears to be related to a study on water quality, sampling, and analysis, with references to scientific papers on topics such as trophic state indices, dissolved organic matter, and phytoplankton growth. There is no mention of machine learning or data preprocessing techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
