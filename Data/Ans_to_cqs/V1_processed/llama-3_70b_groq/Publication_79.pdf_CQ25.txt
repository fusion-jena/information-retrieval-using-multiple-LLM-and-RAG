The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is hierarchical classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The model is designed to classify Brazilian Savanna physiognomies, identify vegetation patterns, and detect scattered shrubs and trees. Specifically, the model aims to perform end-to-end classification, learning features from an input dataset, and presenting increasing complexity through the layers of the network. The model also uses semantic segmentation to identify and distinguish between different tree species and vegetation patterns. Additionally, the model is capable of object detection, such as detecting tree crowns and scattered shrubs.
