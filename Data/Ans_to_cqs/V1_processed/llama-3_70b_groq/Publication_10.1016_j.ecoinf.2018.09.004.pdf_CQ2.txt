The context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning, but it does mention machine learning algorithms. Additionally, it mentions the use of netCDF files, which suggests that the data is likely in a format suitable for environmental or climate-related data. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats. However, the context does mention the use of a Python script to read netCDF files and extract values. 

It can be inferred that the data format used in the pipeline is likely netCDF, which is a format commonly used for storing and sharing multidimensional data such as climate and environmental data. There is no mention of CSV files being used in the pipeline.
