The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that "parameter values were selected based on the RMSEcv values" which suggests that the training process is evaluated using cross-validation and the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. This implies that the training process may be considered complete when the RMSEcv values converge or reach a minimum threshold. However, it does not provide a specific criterion like validation loss plateau.
