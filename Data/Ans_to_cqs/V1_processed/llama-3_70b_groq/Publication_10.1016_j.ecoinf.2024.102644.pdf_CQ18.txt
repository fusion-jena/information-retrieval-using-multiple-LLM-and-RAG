Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the advantages and drawbacks of the model, indications for policy-making authorities, and data limitations. It also discusses the importance of parameter selection methods, model thresholding, and the use of environmental parameters in Ecological Niche Models (ENMs). However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
