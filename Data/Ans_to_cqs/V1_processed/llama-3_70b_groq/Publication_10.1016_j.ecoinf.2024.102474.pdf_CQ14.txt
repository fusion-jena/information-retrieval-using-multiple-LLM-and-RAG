The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. Optuna is a next-generation hyperparameter optimization framework, as mentioned in the reference by Akiba et al. (2019). The exact optimization method used within Optuna is not specified in the provided context, but it is not a grid search or random search.
