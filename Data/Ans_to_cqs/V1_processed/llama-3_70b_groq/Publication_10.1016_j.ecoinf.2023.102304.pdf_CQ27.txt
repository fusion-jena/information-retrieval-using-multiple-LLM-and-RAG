I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to optimizing the parameters of a model for fitting a disturbance-recovery pattern in forest ecosystems, specifically in the context of wildfire and other disturbances. It discusses the use of various indices and methods, such as LTR, NBR, and BFAST, but does not provide information on deploying a trained deep learning model.
