The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context primarily focuses on Support Vector Regression (SVR) and its parameters, including C, ε, and σ. It also briefly mentions a deep learning method called SLSTM, but it does not provide information about its hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
