Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from various sources, including:

1. ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) reports: These reports provide data on herring populations, which is used in the analysis.
2. Reynolds Historical Reconstructed SST (2Â° resolution): This dataset is derived from the Reynolds Optimally Interpolated SST (from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, AVHRR) and in-situ observations, available from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
3. MET Office Hadley Centre EN4 quality controlled ocean data version: EN.4.2.1: This dataset is used for salinity data.
4. In-situ observations: These observations are used in combination with satellite data to derive the Reynolds Historical Reconstructed SST dataset.

It does not appear that surveys or sensors are explicitly mentioned as methods for collecting raw data. However, it is possible that in-situ observations may involve the use of sensors or other data collection methods.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is possible that other methods or datasets may be used in addition to those mentioned above.
