Based on the provided context, it appears that the preprocessing steps involved before training the Res_AUNet network include:

1. Image augmentation: The input images underwent random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance the network's robustness.
2. Cropping: The images were cropped to a size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels.

There is no mention of normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps. It is possible that these steps were performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
