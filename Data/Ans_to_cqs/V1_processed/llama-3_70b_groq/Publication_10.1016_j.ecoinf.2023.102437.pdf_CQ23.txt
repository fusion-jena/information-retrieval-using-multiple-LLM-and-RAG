Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, for environmental science applications. It also mentions the use of techniques such as hyperparameter optimization and feature scaling, but it does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
