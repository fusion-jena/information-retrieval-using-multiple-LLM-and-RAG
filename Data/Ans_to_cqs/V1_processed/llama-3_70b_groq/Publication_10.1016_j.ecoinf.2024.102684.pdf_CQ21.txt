The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, which are the coefficients of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). 

It can be inferred that the calculation of these metrics is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context also mentions the comparison of model performance on the test data and the transfer learning data, which suggests that some form of model evaluation or validation is performed after training.

However, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other techniques for model interpretability or visualization. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context whether these steps are involved or not.
