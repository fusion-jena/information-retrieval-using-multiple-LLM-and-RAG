I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, species distribution, and MaxEnt models, with discussions about environmental and territorial variables, permutation importance, and jackknife tests. There is no mention of deep learning or neural networks, which are typically associated with optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
