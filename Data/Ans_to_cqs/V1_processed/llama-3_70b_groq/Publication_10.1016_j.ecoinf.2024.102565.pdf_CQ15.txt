I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on explaining the basics of Neural Networks (NN), Regression Trees (RT), and Gaussian Processes (GP), as well as their applications in predictive modeling. It also discusses the design considerations for NN, including the number of neurons in hidden layers, but does not delve into optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
