I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research article about wetland use intensity calculation using Sentinel-2 images, but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model or its evaluation metrics. The article discusses the potential for further research, including the comparison of wetland use intensity between time steps and regions, but it does not provide details about the model's performance evaluation.
