I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to various topics such as underwater object detection, bird surveys, human activity detection, and image processing, but it does not provide information about regularization methods in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
