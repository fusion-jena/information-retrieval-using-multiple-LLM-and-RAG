The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses the use of Random Forests (RFs), Generalized Boosting Models (GBMs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for interpolating weather station data and downscaling climate data, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for model training and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
