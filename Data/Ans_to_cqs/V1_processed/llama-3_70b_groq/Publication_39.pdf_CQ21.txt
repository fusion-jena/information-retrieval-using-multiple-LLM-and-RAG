The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the model architecture, training parameters, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, including true positive detections (TP) based on confidence score, IoU, and class prediction. It also provides details on the training process, including the number of epochs, learning rate, momentum, and weight decay.

Therefore, I can infer that some form of metrics calculation is involved, but the specific postprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context.
