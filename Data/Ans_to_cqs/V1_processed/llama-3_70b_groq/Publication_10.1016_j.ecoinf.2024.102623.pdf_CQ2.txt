Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on tabular data, as mentioned in the paper "Revisiting deep learning models for tabular data" by Gorishniy et al. (2021). Additionally, the context mentions the use of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture, which is commonly used for tabular data.

There is no explicit mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention the potential for future expansion to datasets involving various types of data, such as environmental rasters, satellite images, or time series data.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the current deep learning pipeline is likely CSV (Comma Separated Values) or a similar tabular data format.
