Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific post-processing steps involved after the model training. The text only mentions that the approach "required no further user input, pre- or post-processing steps", which implies that there are no post-processing steps involved. However, it does not provide information on what specific steps might be involved if post-processing were necessary. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
