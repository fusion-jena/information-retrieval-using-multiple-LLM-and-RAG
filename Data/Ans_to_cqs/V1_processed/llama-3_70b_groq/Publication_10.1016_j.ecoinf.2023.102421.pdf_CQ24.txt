Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization, machine learning models, and their applications. It does mention random search as a default method for selecting optimal hyperparameters, but it does not delve into strategies for handling randomness.

However, it is worth noting that setting a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and random sampling. By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers and practitioners can ensure that their experiments are reproducible and that the results are not influenced by random fluctuations.

If you are looking for strategies to handle randomness in deep learning, I would recommend exploring other resources that specifically focus on this topic.
