Based on the provided context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of permutation importance and jackknife. 

Permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is reevaluated on the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages. 

The jackknife method is used to determine the percentage contribution of each variable to the MaxEnt model. In each iteration of the training algorithm, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding variable.

These two methods provide insights into the importance of each variable in the model and how they contribute to the model's performance during training.
