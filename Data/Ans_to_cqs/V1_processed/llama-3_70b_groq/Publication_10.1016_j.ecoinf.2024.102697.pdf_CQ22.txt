Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses model complexity, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization, but it does not specify the evaluation metrics used.

However, it is mentioned that Bayesian Optimization was used to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development. This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated using a loss function, but the specific metric is not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the given context.
