Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the deep-learning classifier, its architecture, training strategy, and ensemble results. It discusses the input image size, network configuration, and training strategy, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
