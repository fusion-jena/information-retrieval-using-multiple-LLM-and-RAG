The context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does describe the use of cross-validation and stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models used in the experiment.

Specifically, the text states that stratified cross-validation with K = 10 folds was used to evaluate the performance of the models. This method ensures that every instance is used both for training and testing, and that each fold has a balanced number of instances for each class. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the models are evaluated on a representative sample of the data.

Additionally, the experiment involves using subsets of features to evaluate the effectiveness of the models, which can also help to improve generalizability by reducing overfitting.

There is no mention of using a diverse dataset, but the context implies that the dataset is imbalanced, with one class (Cymodocea) constituting 75% of the dataset. This imbalance is addressed by using the F-measure as the evaluation metric, which is less biased towards the majority class compared to accuracy.
