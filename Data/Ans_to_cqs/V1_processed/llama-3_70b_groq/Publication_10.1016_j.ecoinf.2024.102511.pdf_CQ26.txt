The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques used to enhance data or combine disparate datasets, which can be related to addressing data bias.

For instance, the context mentions "new tools to enhance data" and cites references such as Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019), which is a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of a dataset, which can help address data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions "combined disparate datasets" and cites references such as Dufourq et al. (2022), Nanni et al. (2020), Nolasco et al. (2023), and Padovese et al. (2023). Combining datasets from different sources can help increase the diversity of the data and reduce bias.

However, the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. Therefore, it is unclear whether these specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the context mentions some techniques related to addressing data bias, it does not provide a direct answer to the query.
