Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the mention of "22 convolutional layers" in the text, which is a characteristic feature of CNNs. Additionally, the use of batch normalization (BNorm) layers and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions further supports this conclusion. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context, which suggests that these types of models are not used in the pipeline.
