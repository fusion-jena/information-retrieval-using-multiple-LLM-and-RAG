Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are:

1. White balance
2. Gamma correction
3. Sharpening
4. Dehazing
5. Denoising
6. CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)

These preprocessing methods are mentioned in Table 3, which shows the results of YOLOv8 after applying these methods. However, it does not mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps. It's possible that these steps may be involved in the preprocessing pipeline, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
