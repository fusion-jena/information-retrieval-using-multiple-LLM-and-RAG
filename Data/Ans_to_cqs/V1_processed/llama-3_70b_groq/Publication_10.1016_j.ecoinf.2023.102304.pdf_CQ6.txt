I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the optimization of parameters for a model to better capture the index response to wildfires, and the importance of selecting the most appropriate index for a given region based on climate and vegetation cover conditions. There is no mention of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
