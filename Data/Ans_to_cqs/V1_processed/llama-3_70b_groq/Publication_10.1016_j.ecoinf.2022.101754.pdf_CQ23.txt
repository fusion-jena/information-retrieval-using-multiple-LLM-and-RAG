The study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting to ensure the generalizability of the model. For each setting, 100 different splits to the training-and-test set were given. This stratification splitting helps to reduce overfitting and ensures that the model is trained and tested on diverse subsets of the data. Additionally, tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done for each set, followed by model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter. This process helps to identify the best hyperparameters for the model, which can improve its generalizability. Furthermore, the study used cross-validation R2 (CV_R2) as one of the evaluation metrics, which suggests that cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. However, there is no mention of a diverse dataset being used in the study.
