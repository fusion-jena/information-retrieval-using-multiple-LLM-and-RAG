The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy (OA). These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in classifying the Brazilian Savanna physiognomies. The precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for each class (Grassland, Savanna, and Forest) and are presented in a confusion matrix. The overall accuracy (OA) is also reported, which is 92.8% in this case. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in terms of correctly classifying the different physiognomies.
