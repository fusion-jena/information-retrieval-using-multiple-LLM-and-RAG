The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of LSTM models for air quality inference and discusses the performance of the model on a specific dataset. 

However, it does mention the use of a MinMaxScaler to preprocess the training set, which scales each feature to a [0-1] range. This is a common technique used to normalize the data, but it is not specifically used to address data bias.

The context does not mention any of the techniques listed in the query, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the provided context what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
