Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the training process, including the use of transfer learning and the evaluation metric (mAP50), but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

It is common in machine learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, validation accuracy threshold, or a maximum number of epochs to determine when training is complete. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine which criteria were used in this specific case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
