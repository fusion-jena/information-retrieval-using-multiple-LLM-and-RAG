I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. The context appears to be a literature review or a research paper discussing various machine learning and deep learning models for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water. It cites several research papers and studies but does not provide information about a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
