I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the concept of using deep learning for identifying Collembola species, the importance of Collembola in terrestrial ecosystems, and the potential of deep learning in ecology, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
