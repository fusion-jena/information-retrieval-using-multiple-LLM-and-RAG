The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model is trained with standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring, which can help prevent overfitting. Additionally, the model is trained for 100 epochs, which may help prevent overfitting by allowing the model to converge to a good solution.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention dropout or L2 regularization, which are common regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, it is unclear whether these techniques were used in this specific deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the context mentions data augmentation as a technique to prevent overfitting, it does not provide information on other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
