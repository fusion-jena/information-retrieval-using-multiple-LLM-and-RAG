The context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite image data from Landsat and MODIS Global Land Cover products, which suggests that the data format used is likely to be image data, specifically multispectral or hyperspectral images. There is no mention of audio or video data formats, and CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not mentioned either. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely to be image data, but the exact format (e.g., GeoTIFF, JPEG, etc.) is not specified.
