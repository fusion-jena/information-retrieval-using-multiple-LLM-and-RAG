I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training or splitting data into train, test, and validation sets. The context appears to be discussing a different type of model, FERM, and its application to ecological informatics. It discusses the model's parameters, validation, and performance evaluation using metrics such as the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. There is no mention of deep learning or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
