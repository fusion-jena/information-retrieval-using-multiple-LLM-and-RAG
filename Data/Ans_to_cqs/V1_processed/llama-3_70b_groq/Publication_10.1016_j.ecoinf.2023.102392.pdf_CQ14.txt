Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model are optimized. The context only presents the results of the land use/land cover classification and forest types classification using XGBoost, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameter tuning process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
