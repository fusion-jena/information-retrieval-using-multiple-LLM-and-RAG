I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the process followed to deploy it. The context appears to be related to various research papers and studies on image analysis, network data, and biological systems, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
