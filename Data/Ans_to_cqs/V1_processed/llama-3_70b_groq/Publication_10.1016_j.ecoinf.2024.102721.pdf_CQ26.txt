Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario using deep learning methods, and it discusses various aspects such as scenario analysis of oasis NDVI, data-driven machine learning models, and denoising filters. 

However, it does not provide information on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
