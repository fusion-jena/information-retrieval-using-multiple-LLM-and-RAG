The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that "for every fine-tuning experiment, the model with the smallest validation loss was used for evaluation on the test set." This implies that the data was split into at least three sets: training, validation, and test sets. 

Unfortunately, the context does not provide further information on how the data was split or what criteria were used to allocate samples to each set. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.
