I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning models, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. The context primarily focuses on the AutoML procedure, the architecture of the models, and their performance evaluation using accuracy and AUC metrics. It does not provide information about the specific task or problem that the models are intended to solve. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of the deep learning models based on the provided context.
