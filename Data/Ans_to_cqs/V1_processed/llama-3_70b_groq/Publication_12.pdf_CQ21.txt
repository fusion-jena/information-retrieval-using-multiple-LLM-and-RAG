Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training process, and dataset preparation. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps performed after training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
