The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used is related to remote sensing and image segmentation, as the context mentions "RGB bands" and "NIR band" which are commonly used in remote sensing applications. Additionally, the context mentions "deeplabv3_pascal_train_aug" as the initial checkpoint, which suggests that the PASCAL VOC dataset might be used. But, it is not explicitly stated.
