Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological carbon sink management, remote sensing, and geography information system technology, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. If you have any further information or context related to deep learning models, I may be able to help you with the preprocessing steps involved.
