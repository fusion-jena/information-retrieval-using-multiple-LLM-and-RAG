I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), for estimating Leaf Area Index (LAI) from satellite images. The paper mentions various data sources, including MODIS products and high spatial resolution satellite images from Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A, but it does not provide information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
