The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling (SDM) and discusses the importance of considering the effects of resampling techniques on the training data, particularly bootstrapping, and its impact on model precision. It also mentions the significance of the structure of the training data on the outcomes of models trained with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm.

However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are typically involved before training a deep learning model. These steps are crucial in preparing the data for model training, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
