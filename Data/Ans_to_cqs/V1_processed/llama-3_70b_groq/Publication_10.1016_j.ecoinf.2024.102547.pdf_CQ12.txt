I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The text appears to discuss a study on analyzing a multifrequency acoustics dataset to explore the spatial arrangement of marine organism aggregations, using techniques from fisheries acoustics and functional data analysis. There is no indication of the use of deep learning models in the pipeline.
