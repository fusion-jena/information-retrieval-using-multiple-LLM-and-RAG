Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. Specifically, a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 is used, which means that each node in the layer is ignored with a 50% probability during each training iteration. This helps to reduce the chance of overfitting by emulating the training of a group of different models. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.
