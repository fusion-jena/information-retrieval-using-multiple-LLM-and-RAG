The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 5-fold cross-validation. This is mentioned in section 4.1, where it is stated that "Using T in the base model as training data for the meta-model, the RF algorithm was used to generate the prediction results (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5) of training data T by 5-fold cross-validation." Additionally, in section 3.3, it is mentioned that "a five-fold cross-validation was used to select the number and combinations of features" in the RFECV process. This suggests that 5-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to select the optimal features.
