The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is random selection, where 70% of the data is designated for training and 30% for validation. This is mentioned in section 2.5, Model validation, which states that the dataset is partitioned into training and validation sets using random selection, with 70% of the data for training and 30% for validation. Additionally, the study also uses the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library to facilitate randomized shuffling and division of datasets into distinct training and testing subsets.
