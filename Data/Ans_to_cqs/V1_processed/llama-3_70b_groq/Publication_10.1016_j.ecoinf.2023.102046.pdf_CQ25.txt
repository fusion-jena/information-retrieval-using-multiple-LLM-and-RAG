The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is classification. Specifically, they are used for image classification tasks. The models mentioned, such as ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and CLIP, are all convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are designed to classify images into different categories. The context does not mention segmentation or detection tasks, but rather focuses on the classification performance of these models. Additionally, the mention of cross-entropy loss function and class weights in the context further supports the idea that the purpose of these models is classification.
