Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image data, specifically satellite images. The context mentions the use of Sentinel-2 images, HY-1C CZI images, and OLCI images, which are all types of satellite imagery. Additionally, the context discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, such as land use/land cover classification and water quality classification. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that CSV files may be used to store and process in-situ measured data or other types of data, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.
