Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context only mentions the validation dataset, which was used to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
