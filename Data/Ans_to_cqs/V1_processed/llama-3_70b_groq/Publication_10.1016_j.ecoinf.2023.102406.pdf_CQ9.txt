The data repository mentioned in the context is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). It is a centralized data repository containing 65,000 datasets of 2 billion species observations. The context does not mention a deep learning pipeline, but it does mention that the author filtered tree species data from GBIF for the study. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data repository of the study is GBIF, but it is not explicitly stated as the repository of a deep learning pipeline.
