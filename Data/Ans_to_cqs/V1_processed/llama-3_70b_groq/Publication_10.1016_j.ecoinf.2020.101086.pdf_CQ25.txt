I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text appears to discuss species distribution models (SDMs) and the challenges of building these models due to limited presence sites and sampling bias. It also explains some approaches to addressing these issues, such as transforming model input data and defining parameters like Dmin. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or their applications (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection).
