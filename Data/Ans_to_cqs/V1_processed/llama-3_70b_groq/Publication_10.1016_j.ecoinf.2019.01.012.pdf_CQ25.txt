The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify digital images into two categories: woody vegetation (positive class) and non-woody vegetation (negative class). The model is trained on a dataset of 50x50 pixel image tiles, where each tile is labeled as either woody vegetation or not. The model learns to extract relevant features from the images and makes predictions on new, unseen data.
