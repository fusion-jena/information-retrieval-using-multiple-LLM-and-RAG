Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on ensemble methods for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and AdaBoost. It also mentions the use of heterogeneous ensemble techniques to combine predictions from different models. However, it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in deep learning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
