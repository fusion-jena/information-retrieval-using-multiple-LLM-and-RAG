The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is designed to identify medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants. The model uses attention mechanisms to focus on relevant input elements and improve its performance. The evaluation criteria used to assess the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score, also suggest that the model is intended for classification tasks. Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the mention of image classification operations in the context support the conclusion that the model is designed for classification.
