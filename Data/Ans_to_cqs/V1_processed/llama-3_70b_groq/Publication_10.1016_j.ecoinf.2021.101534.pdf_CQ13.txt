I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or others. It only provides information about the model architecture (YOLOv5s), training settings (number of epochs, batch size, input image dimension), data augmentation techniques, and hardware specifications used for training. It also describes the preprocessing steps for converting audio clips into spectrograms, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the model.
