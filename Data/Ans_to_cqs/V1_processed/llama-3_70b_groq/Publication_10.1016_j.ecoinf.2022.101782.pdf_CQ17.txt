The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the architecture of the CNN model, including the use of transfer learning, batch normalization, and image augmentation, but it does not mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
