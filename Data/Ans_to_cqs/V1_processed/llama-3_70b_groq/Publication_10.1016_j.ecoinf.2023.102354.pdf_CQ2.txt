The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a research study that explores the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for understanding groundwater-climate interactions. It discusses various datasets used in the study, including TWS, SMS, GWS, SPEI, ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, IOD, and others, but it does not specify the data formats of these datasets.

However, based on the descriptions of the datasets, it can be inferred that the data formats are likely to be numerical or tabular data, such as CSV, as they involve climate and hydrological data. The SPEI data, for instance, is described as a statistically based index that uses basic climatological data, which suggests that it may be in a numerical or tabular format. 

In summary, while the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified, it is likely that they are numerical or tabular data formats, such as CSV.
