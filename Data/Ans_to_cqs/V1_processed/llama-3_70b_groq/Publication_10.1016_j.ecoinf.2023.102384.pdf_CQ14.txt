I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the data collection and curation phases, the experimental setup, and the results of the model evaluation, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
