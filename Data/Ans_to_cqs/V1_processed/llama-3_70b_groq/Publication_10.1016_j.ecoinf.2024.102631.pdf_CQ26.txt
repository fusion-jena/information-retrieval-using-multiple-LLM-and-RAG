Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on image enhancement, discussing various methodologies, classical and deep learning-based approaches, and evaluation metrics. It does not delve into data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not discussed in the given context.
