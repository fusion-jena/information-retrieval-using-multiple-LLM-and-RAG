The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the hyperparameters setting for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in two scenarios: no-overfitting and overfitting. It also explains the concept of overfitting, generalization, and their importance in deep learning. However, it does not provide information about preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
