The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions "scale optimization for environmental covariates" in step (d) of the model building procedure, which involves calculating focal statistics for each covariate using a moving window of radius equal to each scale to be tested, and then comparing scales using t-tests. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the models (e.g., GLM, GAM, MARS, MaxEnt, RF, ANN) are optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
