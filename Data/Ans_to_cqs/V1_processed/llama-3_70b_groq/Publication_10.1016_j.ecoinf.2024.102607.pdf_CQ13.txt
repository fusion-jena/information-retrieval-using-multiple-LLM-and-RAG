I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text discusses traditional machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Artificial Neural Networks, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Additionally, there is no mention of deep learning models, which are a specific type of neural network. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
