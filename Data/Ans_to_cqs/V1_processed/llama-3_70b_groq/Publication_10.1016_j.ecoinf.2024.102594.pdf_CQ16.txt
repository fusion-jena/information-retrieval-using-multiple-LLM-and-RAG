According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete are based on the validation loss plateau. Specifically, if the validation loss value does not decrease after 5 consecutive epochs, the learning rate is halved. If there is no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive epochs, the training process is terminated.
