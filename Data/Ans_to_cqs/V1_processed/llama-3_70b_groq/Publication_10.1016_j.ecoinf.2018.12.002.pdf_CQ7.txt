I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to machine learning and its applications in ecological informatics, specifically in inferring animal behavior from location and movement data. It discusses various machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks, but does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.
