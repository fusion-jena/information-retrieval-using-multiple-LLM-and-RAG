Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved.

The context mentions that the second step was to obtain the metrics needed to evaluate the predictions. It defines three variables: True positive, False positive, and False negative, which are used to calculate more global metrics. Specifically, it mentions the calculation of Recall (Eq. 2) and Precision (Eq. 3) metrics.

There is no mention of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix as postprocessing steps. Therefore, it can be concluded that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved, but the context does not provide information about other postprocessing steps.
