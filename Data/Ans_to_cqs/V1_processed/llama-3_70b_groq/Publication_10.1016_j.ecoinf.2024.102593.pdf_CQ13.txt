I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context focuses on the architecture of DNN models, their complexity, and the use of techniques like analysis of embeddings and dimensionality reduction to understand their inner workings. It also mentions specific models like BirdNET and SincNet, but does not provide information about their hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
