The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data collection, preparation, and classification tasks, as well as the creation of training, development, and testing sets. 

However, it is mentioned that the development sets were used to evaluate classification performance during experiments, and the testing sets were used to evaluate the final classifier for each classification task. This implies that some form of metrics calculation or performance evaluation was conducted, but the specific details are not provided.

In summary, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training.
