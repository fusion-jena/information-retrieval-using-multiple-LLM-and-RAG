I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of supervised learning and Random Forest classifier with GLCM texture metrics for land cover classification, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The mention of deep learning is only in the context of future work, suggesting that it was not used in the current study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
