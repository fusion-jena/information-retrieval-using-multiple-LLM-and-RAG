The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses active learning, input selection, and the use of model embeddings and dimensionality reduction to display model predictions, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
