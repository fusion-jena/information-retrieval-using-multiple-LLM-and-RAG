The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not provided in the given context. The "Data availability" section explicitly states that "The authors do not have permission to share data." This implies that the data is not publicly available, and therefore, there is no link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
