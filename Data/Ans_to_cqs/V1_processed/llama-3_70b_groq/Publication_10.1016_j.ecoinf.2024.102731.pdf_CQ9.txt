I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing various data sources for climate, soil, and landscape metrics, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
