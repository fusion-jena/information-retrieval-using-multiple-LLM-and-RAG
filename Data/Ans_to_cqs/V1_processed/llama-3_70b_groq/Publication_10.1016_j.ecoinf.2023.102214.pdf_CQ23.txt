Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the model's performance, evaluation metrics, and the importance of the dataset for individual ID in snow leopards. It highlights the contribution of the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research and the potential for future collaborations to enhance the data. However, it does not provide specific information on the measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
