Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training, and evaluation of object counting models, particularly for aerial elephant detection. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), feature extractors, and density maps for object counting, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
