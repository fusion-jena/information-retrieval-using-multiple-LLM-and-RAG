Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. The context primarily focuses on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and its application in data-driven models, including hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation. It discusses the use of AutoGluon and TabPFN models, but it does not specify the purpose or task of these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
