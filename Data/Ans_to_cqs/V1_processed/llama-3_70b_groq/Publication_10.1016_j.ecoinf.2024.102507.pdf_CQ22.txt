Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, F1-score, and recall. These metrics are shown in Tables 11 and 12, which present the classification accuracy statistics of VGG19 and ResNet50 using flattened convolution kernels with different batch sizes and datasets. The tables include columns for accuracy, precision, F1-score, and recall, indicating that these metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance.
