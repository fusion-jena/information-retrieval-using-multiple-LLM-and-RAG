I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the performance optimization of the MLP model, hyperparameters tuning, and the optimal MLP architecture and parameters. It also provides references to other research papers and articles, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
