Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the grid search approach used to optimize the hyperparameters of the machine learning model, specifically the 'numberOfTrees', 'minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and 'seed' parameters. 

It mentions that the grid search method exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and evaluated the model's performance using cross-validation techniques, with the goal of minimizing the RMSE to achieve the most accurate predictions. However, it does not provide information on when the training process is considered complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
