I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It discusses data filtering, data scaling, and gap filling, but it does not specify the type of model used for analysis or prediction. The context focuses on the preprocessing steps and data manipulation using Google Earth Engine (GEE), but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
