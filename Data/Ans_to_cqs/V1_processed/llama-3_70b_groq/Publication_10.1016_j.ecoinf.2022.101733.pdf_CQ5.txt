The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and earth observation, with references to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, as well as various research papers on topics like crop mapping, wetland mapping, and land use classification. There is no mention of traditional deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
