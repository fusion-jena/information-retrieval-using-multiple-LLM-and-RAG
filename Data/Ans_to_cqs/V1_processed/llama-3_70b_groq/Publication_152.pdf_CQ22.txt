The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are F1 score and Jaccard index. The F1 score is a measure of the model's accuracy on a specific task, and the Jaccard index is a measure of similarity between two sets, often used to evaluate the performance of image segmentation models. The authors mention that the final trained network achieved an F1 score of 0.9034 and a Jaccard index of 0.8287 on the test set. These metrics are used to evaluate the model's ability to identify the invasive vegetation species, Heidychium Coronarium, from UAV-captured images.
