The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses hyperparameter optimization, model performance, and the importance of considering multiple hyperparameters to design an optimized model. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.

The context does show the results of hyperparameter optimization for the learning rate, where the optimal value is determined using Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization techniques. The model performance is then evaluated using the optimal learning rate, as well as higher and lower values, and the results are presented in Fig. 13. But it does not explain how the model performance is monitored during the training process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
