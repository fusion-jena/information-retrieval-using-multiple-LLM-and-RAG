According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Overall Accuracy, Mean Accuracy (MA), Intersection over Union (IoU), and Mean IoU (MIoU). These metrics are used to assess the classification performance of the model, particularly in the context of imbalanced data. The MIoU value is used to determine the point at which the model attains optimal performance. Additionally, the MA and MIoU metrics are computed after each epoch to analyze the training performance of the model.
