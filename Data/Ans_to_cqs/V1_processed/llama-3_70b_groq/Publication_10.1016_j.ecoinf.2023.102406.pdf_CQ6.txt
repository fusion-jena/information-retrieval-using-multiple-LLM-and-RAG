The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on species distribution modeling, sample thinning, and modeling approaches.

However, it does mention "predictor variables" and "response variable of interest" in the context of accuracy metrics, which suggests that some form of data preparation or feature engineering might be involved. Additionally, the context mentions "variable reduction for correlation" in section 2.4, which could imply some form of feature selection or dimensionality reduction.

But, it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps typically involved before training a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
