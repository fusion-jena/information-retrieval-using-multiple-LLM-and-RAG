Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the importance of domain adaptation, semantic image segmentation, and the use of neural networks for image classification tasks. It discusses the need for tailored datasets, supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning approaches, and various neural network architectures like UNet and DeepLabV3. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
