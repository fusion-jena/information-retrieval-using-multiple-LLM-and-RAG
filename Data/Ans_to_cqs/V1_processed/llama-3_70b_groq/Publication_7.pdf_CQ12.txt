The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)" and "deep CNNs" as the class of machine learning algorithms used for image classification and recognition tasks. Additionally, the text specifically mentions the use of a pre-trained VGGnet, which is a type of CNN architecture.
