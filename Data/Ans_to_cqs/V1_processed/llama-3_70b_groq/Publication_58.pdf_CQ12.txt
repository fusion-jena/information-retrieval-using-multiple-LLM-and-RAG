The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the Deep Learning architectures used, which mentions a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple layers of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. Additionally, the description of ResNet (Deep Residual Network) also falls under the category of CNNs.
