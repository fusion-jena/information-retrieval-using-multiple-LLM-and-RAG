Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Gauge data: The CMAP (a collection of precipitation datasets) is produced by analyzing gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipitation.
2. Satellite-based data: Landsat satellite datasets were used to investigate water surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time (1985 to 2020).
3. UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images: This method uses UAV-carried spectrometers to collect near-map images, providing high-precision remote sensing images in small areas.

No mention of surveys or public datasets is made in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data of CMAP can be downloaded from the NOAA repository, which implies that public datasets are used.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention the use of sensors for collecting raw data. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether sensors are used in the deep learning pipeline.
