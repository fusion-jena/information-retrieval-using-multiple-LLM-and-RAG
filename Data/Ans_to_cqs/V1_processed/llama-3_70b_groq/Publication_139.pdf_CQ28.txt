The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture of the convolutional neural network, its performance on the validation dataset, and the limitations of deep learning approaches. There is no mention of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform, or any other deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
