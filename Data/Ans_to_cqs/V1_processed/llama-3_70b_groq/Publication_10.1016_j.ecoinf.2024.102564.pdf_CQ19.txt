The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) as machine learning methods for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. There is no mention of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
