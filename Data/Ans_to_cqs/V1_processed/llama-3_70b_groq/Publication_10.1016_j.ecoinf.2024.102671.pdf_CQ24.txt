I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or random seed values. The context appears to be related to landscape ecology, spatial analysis, and conservation, with discussions of patch types, clustering, and landscape metrics. There is no mention of deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
