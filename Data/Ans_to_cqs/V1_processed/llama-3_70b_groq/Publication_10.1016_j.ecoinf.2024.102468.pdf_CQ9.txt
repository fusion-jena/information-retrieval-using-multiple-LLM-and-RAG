I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the performance of the WT-HMM model on different dataset sizes and its scalability, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
