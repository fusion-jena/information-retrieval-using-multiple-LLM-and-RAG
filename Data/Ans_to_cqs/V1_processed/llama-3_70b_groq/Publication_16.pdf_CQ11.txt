I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the pipeline's architecture, the technologies used, and the challenges faced, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the data repository.
