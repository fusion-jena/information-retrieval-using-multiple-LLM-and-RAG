Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep learning models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Autoencoders for generating synthetic data and modeling coral cover.

However, it can be inferred that the data used for training these models might have undergone some preprocessing steps, but the specific steps are not mentioned. For instance, the context mentions the use of a TVAE model from SDV, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder model, to develop the initial coral cover model. This model maps the original data to distributions in a lower dimensional latent space, which might involve some form of normalization or scaling. However, this is not explicitly stated.

In general, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential before training a deep learning model. These steps help to prepare the data for training, improve model performance, and prevent issues like feature dominance. However, without explicit information, it is difficult to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular context.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
