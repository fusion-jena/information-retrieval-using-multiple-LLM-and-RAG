Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a research article about forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario using deep learning methods, specifically LSTM models. The article discusses the methodology, model structure, and scenario analysis, but it does not provide information about the data formats used in the pipeline.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data might be in the form of time series data, possibly in CSV or similar formats, given the use of LSTM models for time series prediction. Additionally, the article mentions NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) which is often derived from remote sensing imagery, so it's possible that image data might be involved in the pipeline. However, without explicit information, it's impossible to determine the exact data formats used.
