The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This is mentioned in the context as one of the models selected for their ability to model nonlinear evapotranspiration phenomena. The configuration of the MLP model is also provided, including the use of the Adam solver, 10 neurons per hidden layer, a constant learning rate, and the rectifier activation function (ReLU).
