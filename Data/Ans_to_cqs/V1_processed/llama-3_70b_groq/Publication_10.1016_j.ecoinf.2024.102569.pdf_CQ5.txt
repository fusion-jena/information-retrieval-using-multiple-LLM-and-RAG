I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, biodiversity, and statistical modeling, with mentions of eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org as sources of data. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
