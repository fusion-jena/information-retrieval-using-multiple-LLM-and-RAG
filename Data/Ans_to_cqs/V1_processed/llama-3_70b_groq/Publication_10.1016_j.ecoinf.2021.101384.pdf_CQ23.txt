The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the workflow's ability to compensate for biases, the importance of data quality and completeness, and the implementation of a FAIR approach. It discusses the use of data classification, spatio-temporal aggregation, and multi-resolution decision approaches, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
