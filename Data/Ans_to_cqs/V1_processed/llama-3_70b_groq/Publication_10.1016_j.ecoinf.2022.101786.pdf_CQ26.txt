The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the model selection, training, and evaluation process, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

However, it can be inferred that the authors have attempted to collect representative datasets from the deep sea, which might imply that they have tried to collect diverse data. Additionally, the use of manual annotations for generating training, validation, and testing datasets might help reduce bias introduced by automated annotation methods.

But, there is no explicit mention of techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or other bias mitigation methods. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques were used in this specific study.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
