Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in various domains, including karyotyping images of chromosomes, sectioned brain microvasculature, and network data. It discusses the challenges of obtaining ground truth data, crowd-sourcing for manual annotation, and the efficacy of deep learning-based models in these domains. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
