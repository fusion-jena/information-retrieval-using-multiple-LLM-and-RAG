I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and provides information about variable classification, bioclimate, and biological factors, as well as tables showing model classification and variables in the model. However, it does not provide information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework was used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
