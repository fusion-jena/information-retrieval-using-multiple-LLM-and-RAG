I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) model, specifically the NARX feedback ANN model, and a hybrid model that combines wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm. It also provides information about the input and output layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, and the performance of the model. However, it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in the model.
