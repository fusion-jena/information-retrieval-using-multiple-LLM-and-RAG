The context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Instead, it mentions the use of machine learning algorithms such as RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, which are traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models. The ensemble of machine learning models is used to predict Short-billed Gull abundance hotspots and coldspots.
