The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to species distribution models (SDMs) and covariate selection procedures, discussing algorithms such as generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and random forests. It does not mention deep learning or techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
