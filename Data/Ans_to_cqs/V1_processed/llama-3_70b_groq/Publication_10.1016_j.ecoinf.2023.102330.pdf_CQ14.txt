Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context provides information about the model components, prior distributions, and evaluation metrics (RMSE and CV), but it does not discuss the optimization of hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
