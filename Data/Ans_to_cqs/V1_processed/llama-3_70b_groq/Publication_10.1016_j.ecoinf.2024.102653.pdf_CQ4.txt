The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the design of a deep-learning architecture for toxicovigilance, discussing the model's structure, hyperparameters, and performance metrics. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
