I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN model, its components, and the training process, but it does not provide information about the data annotation techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
