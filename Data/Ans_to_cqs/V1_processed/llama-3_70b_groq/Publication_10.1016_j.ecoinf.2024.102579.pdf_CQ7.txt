I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning model training or splitting data for training, testing, and validation. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecological informatics, discussing topics such as continuous cover forestry, inventory estimators, and diversity indices. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning concepts, making it impossible to determine the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training.
