The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "accuracy" in the context of data augmentation and "loss" in the context of training the network. Additionally, it presents figures for "Training loss", "Training accuracy", "Validation accuracy", and "Normalized confusion matrix", which suggests that accuracy and loss are used as evaluation metrics. There is no mention of precision, recall, or other metrics.
