Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and deep learning methods such as SLSTM and SGRU for time-series prediction, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
