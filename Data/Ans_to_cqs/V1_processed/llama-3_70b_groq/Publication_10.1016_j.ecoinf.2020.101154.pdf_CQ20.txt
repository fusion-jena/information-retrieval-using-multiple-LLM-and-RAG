I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training the model. It discusses the hyperparameters tuning, GBRT model performance, and data sources, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
