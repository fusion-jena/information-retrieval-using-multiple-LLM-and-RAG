Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to be focused on explaining SHAP values, a scenario analysis of oasis NDVI, and the architecture of an LSTM model, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
