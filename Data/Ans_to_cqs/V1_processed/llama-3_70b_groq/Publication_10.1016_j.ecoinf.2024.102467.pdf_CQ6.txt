Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various papers in the fields of computer vision, machine learning, and aquaculture, but it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps.

However, it is common knowledge in the field of deep learning that preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential before training a model. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming the data to a common scale, such as standardization or feature scaling. Cleaning involves removing missing or noisy data, handling outliers, and transforming categorical variables into numerical variables.

Without specific information from the context, it is difficult to provide more detailed information on the preprocessing steps involved.
