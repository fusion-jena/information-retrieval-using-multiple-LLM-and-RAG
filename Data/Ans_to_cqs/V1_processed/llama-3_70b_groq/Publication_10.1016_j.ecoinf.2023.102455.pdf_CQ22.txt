The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Correlation Coefficient, Root Mean Squared Error, and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency. These metrics are mentioned in the provided context, indicating that they are used to assess the performance of the model. However, it does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used metrics in other deep learning applications.
