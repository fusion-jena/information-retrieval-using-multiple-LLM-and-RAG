The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. The models mentioned are Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). These are traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models.

The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are specific to these models:

* For RF, the hyperparameter is `mtry`, which controls the input variables for the decision trees.
* For SVM, the hyperparameters are `gamma` (influence of the training data) and `C` (misclassification penalty).
* For MARS, the hyperparameters are `degree` (maximum degree of interactions between input variables) and `nprune` (controls the number of terms in the model).

There is no mention of hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer, which are typically associated with deep learning models.
