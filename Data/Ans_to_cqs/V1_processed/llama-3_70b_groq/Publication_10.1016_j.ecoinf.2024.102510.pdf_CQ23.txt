The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does acknowledge the potential limitations and biases of the training dataset, such as geographical bias, limited sample sizes, and underrepresentation of certain bird species. The authors emphasize the importance of considering these limitations when interpreting the results and making inferences about real-world bird species recognition.

The context also mentions that a 60:40 split of training and testing data was used for model evaluation, which suggests that some form of data splitting was employed. However, it does not specify whether cross-validation or stratified splitting was used.

Additionally, the authors highlight the need for collecting more comprehensive and diverse datasets that better reflect the true variability of bird populations. This implies that the current dataset may not be diverse enough, and efforts should be made to improve it.

In summary, while the context acknowledges the importance of ensuring generalizability and mentions some data splitting, it does not provide specific details on the measures taken to achieve this.
