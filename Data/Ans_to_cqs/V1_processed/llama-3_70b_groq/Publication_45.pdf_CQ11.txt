I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions that the complete data set is available online, but it refers to a specific dataset used in the study (Seidl et al., 2015) and not the deep learning pipeline itself. It does not provide a link to a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
