The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metric used, which is the mean average precision (mAP) score. Specifically, it mentions that the model achieved a mAP50 score of 0.75, which indicates that the area of the intersection of the ground truth bounding box and the predicted bounding box needs to be at least 50% of the area of the union of both for an otherwise true species identification to be considered correct.

It also mentions that the network outputs a belief b âˆˆ [0, 1] that a particular species has been identified, which implies that thresholding these values might be involved in the postprocessing steps. However, it does not provide further information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that the mAP score is used as an evaluation metric, but I do not know the other postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
