Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with audio data. The text mentions "three-second long audio segments" and "audio signals" being used as input for the models. Additionally, it mentions "spectrograms" being calculated from the audio signals, which is a common technique used in audio processing. The models mentioned, such as BirdNet, YAMNet, and VGGish, are also known to be audio-based models.

There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it's worth noting that some models, such as ResNet152-V2 and VGG16, are typically used for image classification tasks, but in this context, they are being used to process spectrograms, which are essentially images representing audio signals.

Therefore, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio, with spectrograms being used as an intermediate representation.
