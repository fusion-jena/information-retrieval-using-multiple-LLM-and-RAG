Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the multiple references to CNNs in the context, such as in [16], [17], [20], [21], and [23]. Specifically, the U-Net architecture, which is a type of CNN, is mentioned in [20], [21], [22], and [23] as being used for tasks such as semantic segmentation, identifying eucalyptus trees, corn plant counting, and identifying and grading maize drought. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
