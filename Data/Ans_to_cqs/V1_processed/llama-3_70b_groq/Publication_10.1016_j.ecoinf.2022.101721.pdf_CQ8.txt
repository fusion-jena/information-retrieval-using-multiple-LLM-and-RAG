The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be discussing a statistical modeling approach using Bayesian approximation and R-code, with a supplement S1 containing the R-code. There is no mention of a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I don't know where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available, as it is not mentioned in the context.
