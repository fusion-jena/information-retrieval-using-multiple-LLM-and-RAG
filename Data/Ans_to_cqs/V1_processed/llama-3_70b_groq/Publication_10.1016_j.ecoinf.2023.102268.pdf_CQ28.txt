I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification, but it does not provide information about the platform or infrastructure used to deploy the model. The references cited are related to the use of CNNs for image classification and feature extraction, but they do not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model based on the provided context.
