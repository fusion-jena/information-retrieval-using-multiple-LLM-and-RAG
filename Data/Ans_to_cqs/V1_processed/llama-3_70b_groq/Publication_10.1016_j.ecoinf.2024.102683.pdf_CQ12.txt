The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context as "CNN-based methods have better performance in identifying plants" and also in the description of the proposed approach (SCAM-Herb model) where it is stated that "the CNN model starts to process the folds". Additionally, the context also mentions the use of Channel Attention (CA) mechanisms, which is often used in conjunction with CNNs.
