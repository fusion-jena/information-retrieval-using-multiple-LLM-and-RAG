Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only provides information about the training time, prediction time, and optimization time for the CNN and XGBoost models, as well as the hardware used. It also lists the input variables used in the XGBoost and CNN models, but does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
