I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the use of transfer learning and convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of plant species classification. It discusses the use of pre-trained models and fine-tuning on specific datasets, but does not provide information on the annotation techniques used to prepare the data for these models.
