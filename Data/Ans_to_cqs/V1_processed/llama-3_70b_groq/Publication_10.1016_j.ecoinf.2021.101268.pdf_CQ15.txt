The provided context mentions one optimization technique, which is Adam. This is stated in the paper "Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization" by Kingma and Ba (2014). However, it does not mention other optimization techniques like SGD. Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that Adam is one of the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
