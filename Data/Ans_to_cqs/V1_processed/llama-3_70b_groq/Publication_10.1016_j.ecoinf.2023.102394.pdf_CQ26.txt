The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention propensity score methods, which can be used to reduce the effects of confounding in observational studies. This might be related to addressing data bias, but it is not directly applicable to the deep learning pipeline.

The context also mentions techniques such as inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies. Again, this is not directly related to addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines.

The context does not mention specific techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
