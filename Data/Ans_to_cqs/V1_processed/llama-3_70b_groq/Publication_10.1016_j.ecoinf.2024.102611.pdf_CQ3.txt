I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on various studies and research papers related to plant species classification, disease detection, and medicinal plant identification using deep learning models. It discusses different architectures, techniques, and approaches used in these studies, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
