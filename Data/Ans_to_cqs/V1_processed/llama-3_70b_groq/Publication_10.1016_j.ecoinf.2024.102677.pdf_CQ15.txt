Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the selection and evaluation of different CNN architectures (VGG, Inception, ResNet) for landscape type classification, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques employed during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
