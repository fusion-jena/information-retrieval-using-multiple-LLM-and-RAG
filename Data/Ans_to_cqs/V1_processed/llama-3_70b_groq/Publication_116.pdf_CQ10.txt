I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing various aspects of deep learning, including feature extraction, convolutional neural networks, and batch normalization. It cites several references and includes tables and figures, but it does not provide a link to a code repository.
