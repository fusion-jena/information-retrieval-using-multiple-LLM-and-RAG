Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the application of machine learning and artificial neural networks in the agricultural field, specifically for insect pest recognition, and presents the results of the developed recognition system. It also describes the system's architecture, user interface, and database management. However, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
