I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses various topics, including species distribution modeling, acoustic indices, bird diversity, and deep learning approaches, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
