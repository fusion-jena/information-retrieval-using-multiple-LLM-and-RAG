Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of sensors and imaging technologies, particularly in the field of remote sensing and agriculture. 

Several papers mention the use of hyperspectral and multispectral imagery, as well as thermal imagery, collected from airborne and UAV-based sensors. For example, Calder√≥n et al. (2013) used high-resolution airborne hyperspectral and thermal imagery for early detection of Verticillium wilt of olive. Similarly, Bingtao et al. (2023) used hyperspectral UAV images for early detection of dendroctonus valens infestation.

Additionally, some papers mention the use of satellite-based sensors, such as Sentinel-2, for collecting data. For instance, Binxiang et al. (2022) used Sentinel-2 data to develop a triangular vegetation index for chlorophyll content estimation.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in other deep learning pipelines or applications.

Overall, the context suggests that sensors and imaging technologies play a significant role in collecting raw data for deep learning applications in the field of remote sensing and agriculture.
