I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be focused on presenting quantitative comparisons of different models on various datasets using different metrics, such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE. It discusses the performance of the models and provides tables showing the results, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
