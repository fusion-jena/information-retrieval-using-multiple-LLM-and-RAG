Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are audio and image. 

The audio format is used as the input data, which is then converted into spectrograms as input images for model training. The audio recordings are standardized, segmented, augmented, and transformed into fixed-sized input images for model training. 

The image format is used as the output of the spectrogram conversion, which is then fed into the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for sound identification. The input image dimension for model training is 640 Ã— 640. 

There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
