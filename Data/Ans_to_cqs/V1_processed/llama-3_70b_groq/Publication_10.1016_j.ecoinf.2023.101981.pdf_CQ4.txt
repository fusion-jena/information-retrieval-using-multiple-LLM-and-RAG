I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be discussing the detection of cow vocalizations using a software called Kaleidoscope, and mentions parameters such as FFT window size and minimum frequency, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
