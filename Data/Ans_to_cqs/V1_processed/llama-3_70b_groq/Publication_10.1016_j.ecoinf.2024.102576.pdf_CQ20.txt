I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the methodology for training the model, the importance of labeling data, and the use of U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
