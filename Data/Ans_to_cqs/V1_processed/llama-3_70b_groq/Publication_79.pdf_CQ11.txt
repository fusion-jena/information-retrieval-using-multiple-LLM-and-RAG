I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The references cited are mostly academic papers and do not provide a link to a data repository. Additionally, there is no mention of Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, which are popular data repository platforms. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
