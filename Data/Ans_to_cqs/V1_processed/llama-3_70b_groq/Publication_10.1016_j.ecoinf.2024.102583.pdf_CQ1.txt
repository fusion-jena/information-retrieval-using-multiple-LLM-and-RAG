I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) and discusses various techniques and models used for LSM, such as weights-of-evidence, frequency ratio, weighted overlay, analytical hierarchy process, and evidential belief function. It also mentions the use of remote sensing and geospatial analysis technologies, but it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
