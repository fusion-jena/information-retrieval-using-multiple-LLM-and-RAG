I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on assessing water quality using machine learning approaches, but it does not provide information on the data formats used in the pipeline. The context mentions data splitting ratios, training and testing datasets, and various research studies, but it does not specify the data formats used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
