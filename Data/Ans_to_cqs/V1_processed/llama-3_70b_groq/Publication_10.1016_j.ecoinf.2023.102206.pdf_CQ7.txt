The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on transfer learning, its application to predict GDP using CO2 emission data, and the comparison of IFTL and FTL approaches. It discusses the importance of handling data distribution differences between the source and target domains but does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model requirements. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular case.
