I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the application of deep learning methods in various fields, such as intrusion detection, air pollution, and solar energy generation. It also compares the performance of different models, including SGRU, ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SVR, and SLSTM, in predicting time-series data. However, it does not provide information on how the trained deep learning model was deployed, including model serialization and platform selection.
