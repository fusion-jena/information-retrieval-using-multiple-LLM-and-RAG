The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Short-billed Gull presence/absence data using machine learning ensemble predictions, including RandomForest, CART, and MARS regression splines. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
