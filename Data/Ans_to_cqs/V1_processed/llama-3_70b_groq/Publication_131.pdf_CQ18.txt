Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context focuses on the training process, hyperparameters, and the system architecture, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
