The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "adapt regularization to the image size" in the context of progressive learning, which was used to improve the model performance. 

It does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
