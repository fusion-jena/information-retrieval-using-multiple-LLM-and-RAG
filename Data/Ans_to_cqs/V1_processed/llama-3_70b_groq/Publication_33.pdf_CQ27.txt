I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It explains the framework's three parts: the learning phase, which consists of training a CNN model and tuning a risk threshold, and the applicative testing step. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
