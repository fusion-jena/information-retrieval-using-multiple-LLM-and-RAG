I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context discusses dimensionality reduction methods, species distribution modeling, and bioclimatic variables, but it does not provide information about regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
