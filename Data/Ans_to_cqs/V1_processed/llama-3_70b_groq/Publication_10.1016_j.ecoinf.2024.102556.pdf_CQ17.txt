The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the architecture of the MSNet and Res2Net modules, and how they are used to improve feature extraction in the Deep SORT algorithm for multi-object tracking. It discusses the limitations of traditional residual networks and how the Res2Net framework addresses these limitations. However, it does not mention regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
