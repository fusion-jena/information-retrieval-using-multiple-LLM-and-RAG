The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing data, particularly Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images and Landsat 8 satellite images, for creating fire risk maps in forest ecosystems. It discusses the use of various modeling techniques, including artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression, but does not specify the datasets used for training these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
