The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the grid search technique. This is explicitly stated in the context: "the grid search technique was applied to compute the optimum values of hyperparameters" for both MLP and RF predictors. This means that all possible combinations of hyperparameters were tested, and the best-performing combination was selected for the final model.
