I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text discusses the use of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset, conditional random fields, and semantic segmentation, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
