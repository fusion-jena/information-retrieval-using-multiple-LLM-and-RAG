The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated from the predicted multi-labels for the overlapped bird calls audio from the test dataset. The formulations for these metrics are provided in the context, where precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, and recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. The F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which is 2*(precision*recall) / (precision + recall).
