The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model in this study are the coefficient of determination (R2), mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of water quality parameter predictions. 

R2 quantifies the fraction of variance in the dependent variable accounted for by the independent variables in the model. MBE evaluates the model's average bias, identifying if any rectifications are required to address this bias. RMSE calculates the discrepancies between predicted and true values, while MAE quantifies the average size of these prediction errors. 

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance in predicting TSM concentration based on wind speed data. The study aims to identify the most effective algorithm for this particular application by scrutinizing each model's capability to predict TSM concentration.
