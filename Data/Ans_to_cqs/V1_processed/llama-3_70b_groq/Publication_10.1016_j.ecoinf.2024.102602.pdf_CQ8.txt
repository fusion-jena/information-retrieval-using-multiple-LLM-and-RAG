I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where it can be found. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for detecting invasive plant species, but it does not include any references to a specific code repository or provide a link to access the code. Therefore, I am unable to determine where the code repository is available.
