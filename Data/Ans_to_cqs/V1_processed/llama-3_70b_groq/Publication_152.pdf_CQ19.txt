Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of U-Net, SE-ResNet-50, and convolutional networks, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
