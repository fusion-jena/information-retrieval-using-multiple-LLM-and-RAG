The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression, specifically to predict plant functional traits from simple RGB photographs. The model is trained to extract a set of plant functional traits, including plant and organ size (GH, LA) and the leaf economics spectrum (SLA), from images. The model's output is a single prediction value for each trait, as indicated by the dense layer with 1 output unit in the regressor. The model is not used for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks, but rather for predicting continuous values of plant functional traits.
