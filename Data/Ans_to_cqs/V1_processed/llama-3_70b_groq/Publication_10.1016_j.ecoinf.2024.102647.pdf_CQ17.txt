The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses feature selection, soil salinity distribution mapping, and groundwater salinity hazard maps, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. 

However, it does mention the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method, which is a feature selection technique used to prevent over-fitting or under-fitting in machine learning models. RFE is not a regularization method in the classical sense, but it can help reduce overfitting by selecting the most relevant features and eliminating less significant ones.

In summary, the context does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, but it does mention the RFE method, which can help with feature selection and prevent overfitting.
