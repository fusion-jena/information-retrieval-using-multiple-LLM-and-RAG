According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is when the validation loss of the model reaches a plateau. Specifically, it is mentioned in section 4.1 that "The validation loss of the model reached a plateau at the 42nd epoch, and the parameters were saved for inference." This suggests that the model training is considered complete when the validation loss stops improving and reaches a stable state, which is referred to as a plateau.
