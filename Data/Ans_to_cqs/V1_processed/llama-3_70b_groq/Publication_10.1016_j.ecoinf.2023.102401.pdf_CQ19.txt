I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the YWnet model, its performance compared to other models, and the steps involved in training and evaluating the model, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement the model. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the deep learning model.
