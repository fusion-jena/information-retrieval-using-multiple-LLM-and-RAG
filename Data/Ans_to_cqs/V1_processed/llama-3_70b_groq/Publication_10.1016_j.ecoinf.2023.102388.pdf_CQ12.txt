Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the VGG16 architecture. This is mentioned in the context as "The architecture of VGG16, as depicted in Fig. 5, consists of five sets of convolutional layers alternating with five max-pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers and an output layer." Additionally, the context also mentions the use of a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) in the pipeline, but it is not the primary deep learning model used.
