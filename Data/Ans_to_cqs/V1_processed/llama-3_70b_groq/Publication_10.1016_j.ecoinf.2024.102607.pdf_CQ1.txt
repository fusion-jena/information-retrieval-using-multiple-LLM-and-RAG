The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, remote sensing, and machine learning algorithms. It discusses the importance of selecting representative training samples, the choice of machine learning algorithms, and various techniques for addressing unbalanced training data.

However, it can be inferred that remote sensing imagery is used as a source of data, as mentioned in the context. For instance, the paper by Davidson et al. (2020) uses Sentinel imagery, and Chen et al. (2015) use multi-source remotely sensed data fusion. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, which is a public dataset.

It is likely that surveys, sensors, and public datasets might be used in LULC mapping, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
