I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or using hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs. The context appears to be related to a study on ecological informatics in China, citing various research papers on topics such as grassland productivity, cropland suitability, and vegetation dynamics. There is no mention of deep learning models or hardware resources, so it is not possible to determine which hardware resources are used for training a deep learning model.
