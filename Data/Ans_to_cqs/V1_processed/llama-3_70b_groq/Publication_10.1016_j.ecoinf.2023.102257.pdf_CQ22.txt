The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, and recall. According to the context, the model achieved an accuracy of 92.2% on the given data, with 45.2% true positive classifications, 47.0% true negative, 4.2% false positive, and 3.6% false negative. Additionally, the precision and recall of the model were 92.6% and 91.5%, respectively. These metrics are derived from the observed classification outcomes shown in the confusion matrix (Fig. 3).
