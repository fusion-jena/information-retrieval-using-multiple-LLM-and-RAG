The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the data splitting, model training, and evaluation process, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
