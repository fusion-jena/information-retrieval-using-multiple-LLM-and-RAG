The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets in a ratio of 80:10:10, which is a common practice to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 

Additionally, the context mentions that five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family were trained, which could potentially help in identifying the most generalizable model. However, it does not provide further information on whether these models were trained on different subsets of the data or with different hyperparameters.

It is also worth noting that the context cites previous studies that used deep learning models for detecting small insects and diseases, which suggests that the authors may have followed similar approaches to ensure generalizability. However, without explicit information, it is difficult to determine the exact measures taken to ensure generalizability.

In summary, while the context provides some information on the dataset splitting and model training, it does not provide explicit information on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
