The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

Accuracy is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of images. 

Precision is calculated as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). 

Recall is calculated as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). 

F1 score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which is 2 times the product of precision and recall divided by the sum of precision and recall.
