Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the dataset curation, hyperparameter settings, and references related to weed detection and precision agriculture. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
