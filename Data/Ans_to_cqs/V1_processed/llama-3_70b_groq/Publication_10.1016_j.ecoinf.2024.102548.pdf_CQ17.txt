The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of RNNs, transfer learning, and pre-trained models like ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2, but it does not mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. 

However, it does mention the importance of model complexity and the risk of overfitting, particularly in scenarios with limited training samples. It also discusses the trade-off between model capacity and computational requirements. 

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used in this deep learning pipeline, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
