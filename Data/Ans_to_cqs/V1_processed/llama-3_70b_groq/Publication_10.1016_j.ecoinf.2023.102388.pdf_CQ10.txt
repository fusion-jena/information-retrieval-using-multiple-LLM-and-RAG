I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various deep learning models, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, and their applications in marine mammal and fish habitat monitoring, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
