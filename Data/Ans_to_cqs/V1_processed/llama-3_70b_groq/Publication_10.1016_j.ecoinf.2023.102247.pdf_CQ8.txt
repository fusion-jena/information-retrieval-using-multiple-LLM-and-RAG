I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The text discusses a study on predicting the distribution of a species using an ensemble modeling approach in R, and mentions the use of BIOMOD2 package and various machine learning models such as MaxEnt, RF, and SVM. However, it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
