Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and recall. Specifically, the precision greater than 0.95 at any recall level is mentioned as a metric. Additionally, recall at 0.95 precision is also reported, which measures the fraction of calls that were detected while accepting a false positive rate of 5%. There is no mention of accuracy as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
