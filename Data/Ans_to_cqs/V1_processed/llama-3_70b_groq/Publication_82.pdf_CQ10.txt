Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the experiments were conducted using a fork of Caffe, which is a fast, open-source framework for deep learning, but it does not provide a link to the specific repository used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
