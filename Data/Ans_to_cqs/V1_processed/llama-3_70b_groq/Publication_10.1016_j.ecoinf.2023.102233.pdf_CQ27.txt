Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the active learning approach, model development pipeline, and model evaluation. It discusses the hyperparameter tuning, batch size, learning rate, and other aspects of the model training process, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
