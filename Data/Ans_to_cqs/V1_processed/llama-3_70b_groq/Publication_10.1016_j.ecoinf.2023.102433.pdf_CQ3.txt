I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a web service for accessing NASA data, specifically discussing the DataHarvester class, MongoDB, and other data storage solutions. It also mentions data formats such as CSV and JSON, but does not provide information about data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
