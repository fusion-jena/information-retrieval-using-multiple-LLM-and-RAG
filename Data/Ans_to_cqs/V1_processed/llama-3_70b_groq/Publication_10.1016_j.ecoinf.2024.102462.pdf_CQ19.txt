The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only discusses the methodology and concepts related to deep learning, including image classification, supervised approach, and residual connections. It does not provide information about the implementation details or the specific frameworks used to build the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
