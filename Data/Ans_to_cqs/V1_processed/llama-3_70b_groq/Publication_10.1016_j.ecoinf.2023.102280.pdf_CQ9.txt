I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The only mention of a repository is Zenodo, but it is mentioned as a standalone reference (zenodo.3243139) without any connection to the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
