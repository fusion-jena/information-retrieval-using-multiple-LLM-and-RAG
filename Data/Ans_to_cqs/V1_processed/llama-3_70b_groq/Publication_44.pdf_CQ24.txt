The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of DeepLabv3+ for leaf segmentation in herbarium sheet images, discussing the model architecture, training procedures, and results.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments, to improve network generalization. These techniques can help reduce overfitting and increase the robustness of the model to random variations in the input data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of an Adam optimizer with a specific learning rate and batch size, which can also help mitigate the effects of randomness in the training process.

In general, deep learning pipelines often employ strategies such as setting a random seed value, using dropout layers, and applying regularization techniques to handle randomness and improve model robustness. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
