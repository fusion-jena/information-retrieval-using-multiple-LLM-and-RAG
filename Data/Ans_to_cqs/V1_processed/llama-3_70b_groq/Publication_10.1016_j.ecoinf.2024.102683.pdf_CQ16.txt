The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context focuses on the performance evaluation of the proposed SCAM-Herb models using various evaluation criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. It also compares the performance of the proposed model with other state-of-the-art models. 

However, Fig. 8 shows the accuracy of the training sets at different epochs by SCAM-Herb model based on various modules. The figure suggests that the performance of the proposed models increases with the number of epochs and the number of training data. But it does not provide information on when to stop training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the criteria used to decide when training is complete.
