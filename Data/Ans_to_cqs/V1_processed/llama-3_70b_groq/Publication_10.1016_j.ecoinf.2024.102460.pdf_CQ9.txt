The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The "Data availability" section only mentions that "Data will be made available on request", but it does not specify a particular repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
