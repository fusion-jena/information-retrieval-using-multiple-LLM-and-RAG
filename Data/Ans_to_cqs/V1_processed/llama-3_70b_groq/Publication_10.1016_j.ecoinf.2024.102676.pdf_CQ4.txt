I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on footprint identification, missing value imputation, and machine learning-based methods for species classification. It discusses the importance of preserving valuable data by using missing value imputation and including sub-quality footprints in the data preprocessing pipeline. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
