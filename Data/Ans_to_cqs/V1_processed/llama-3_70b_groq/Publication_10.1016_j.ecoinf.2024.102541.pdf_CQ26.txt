Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on deep learning models, their architectures, and performance enhancements, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation strategies.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the Microsoft COCO dataset, which is a popular dataset for object detection tasks. The COCO dataset is known for its diversity and is often used as a benchmark for object detection models. This implies that the authors might have used a diverse dataset to mitigate data bias, but it is not explicitly stated.

In the absence of explicit information, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or information, I may be able to provide a more accurate answer.
