I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on automated machine learning (AutoML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), with a detailed explanation of AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library. It discusses the automation of tasks such as data pre-processing, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
