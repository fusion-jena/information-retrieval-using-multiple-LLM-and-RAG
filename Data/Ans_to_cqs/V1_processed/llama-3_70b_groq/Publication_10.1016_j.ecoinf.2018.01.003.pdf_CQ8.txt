I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The text discusses various machine learning models, such as Bayesian learning machines, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the application of machine learning models in ecological informatics, but it does not include details about the implementation or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
