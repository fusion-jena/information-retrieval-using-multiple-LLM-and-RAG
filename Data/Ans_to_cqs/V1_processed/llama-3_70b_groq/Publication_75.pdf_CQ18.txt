Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the performance metrics used for image retrieval and the results of the experiments. It discusses the different networks used, their accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and mean average values, as well as the training times. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
