The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a "cloud-based GEE processing environment" in the context of calculating Wetland Use Intensity (WUI). GEE stands for Google Earth Engine, which is a cloud-based platform for geospatial data analysis and visualization. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely deployed on the Google Cloud platform, but this is not explicitly stated.
