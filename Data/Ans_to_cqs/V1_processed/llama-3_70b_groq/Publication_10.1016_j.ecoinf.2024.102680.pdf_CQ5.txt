Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the challenges of underwater optical images, the limitations of the YOLOv8 network, and the proposed CSMB module for feature extraction. It also mentions other methods such as DP-FishNet, but it does not provide information about the datasets used for training or testing these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
