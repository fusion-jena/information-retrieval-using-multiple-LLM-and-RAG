Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is Top-1 accuracy (%). This is evident from Table 2, which presents the accuracy of different models on task I: Detecting images that contain animals. The top-performing architecture is indicated in bold font, and the accuracy values are reported as Top-1 accuracy (%). There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that Top-1 accuracy (%) is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context.
