The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are based on the integrity of capture events. Since the camera trap image datasets (SS and LSM) frequently comprise three images in a capture event that are significantly similar to each other, the authors ensured that all images of an event were put into the same dataset to prevent poor generalization of the DCNN model. This means that the data was split in a way that maintains the integrity of these capture events, rather than randomly splitting the images across training, test, and validation sets.
