Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology, specifically in image analysis for species identification and spatial co-occurrence quantification. It does not delve into the technical details of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
