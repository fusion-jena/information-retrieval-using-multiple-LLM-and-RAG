Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in fish individual recognition, model compression, and optimization techniques. It discusses the use of various models, such as YOLOv4, FaceNet, and Pytorch, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the resolution of images used for training, which is 1024 Ã— 1024. This suggests that the images may have undergone some form of resizing or scaling, but the exact preprocessing steps are not specified.

In general, common preprocessing steps in deep learning include normalization, scaling, data augmentation, and cleaning. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves resizing images to a fixed size, as mentioned in the context. Data augmentation involves applying random transformations to the training data to increase its size and diversity. Cleaning involves removing noisy or irrelevant data from the dataset.

However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular context.
