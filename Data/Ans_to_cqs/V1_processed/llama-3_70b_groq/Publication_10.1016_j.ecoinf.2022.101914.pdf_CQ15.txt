I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing ensemble modeling approaches and the optimization of background points for individual models, but it does not provide information about deep learning or specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
