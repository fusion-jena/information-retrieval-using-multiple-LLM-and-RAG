I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the training process, including the batch size, optimizer, learning ratio, and loss function, but it does not mention the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework was used.
