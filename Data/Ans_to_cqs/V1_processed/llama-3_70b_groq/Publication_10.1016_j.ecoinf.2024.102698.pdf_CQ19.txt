The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python package, and mentions other types of models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and autoencoders. However, it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
