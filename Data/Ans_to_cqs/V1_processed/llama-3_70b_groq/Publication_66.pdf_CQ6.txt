Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for predicting diving behavior in seabirds, comparing their performance with other behavioral prediction methods, and discussing the advantages of deep learning models.

However, it can be inferred that the input variables used to train the deep learning models are those recorded solely by the GPS device, which include variation in longitude and latitude, altitude, and coverage ratio (proportion of possible fixes acquired within a set window of time). There is no mention of any specific preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, being applied to these variables before training the models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this query.
