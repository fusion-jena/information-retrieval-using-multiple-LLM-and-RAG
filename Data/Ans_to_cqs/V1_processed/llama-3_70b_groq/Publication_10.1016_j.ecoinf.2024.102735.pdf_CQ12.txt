The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "deep learning with Bayesian approximation for uncertainty assessment" is used for predicting chlorophyll-a as an indicator of harmful algal blooms (Busari et al., 2024). This suggests that a deep learning model with Bayesian approximation is used, but the specific type (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) is not specified.
