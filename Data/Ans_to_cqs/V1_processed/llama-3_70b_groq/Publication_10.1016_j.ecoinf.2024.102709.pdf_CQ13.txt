Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions the use of k-fold cross-validation, the number of epochs (500), and the image size (640 pixels) for training the model. It also discusses the YOLO loss function and its components, including box loss, but does not provide information about the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
