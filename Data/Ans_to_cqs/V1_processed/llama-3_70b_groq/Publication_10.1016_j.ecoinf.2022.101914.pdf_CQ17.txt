I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, dropout, or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing model selection and evaluation in the context of species distribution modeling, specifically the use of random forests, GLM, and MaxEnt models. It discusses the selection of background points for model training and evaluation, but does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
