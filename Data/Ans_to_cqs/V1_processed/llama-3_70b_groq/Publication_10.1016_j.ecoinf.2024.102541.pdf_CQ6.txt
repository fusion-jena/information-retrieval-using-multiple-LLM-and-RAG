The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention batch normalization in the context of the Convolution-Batch Normalization-Sigmoid (CBS) unit in YOLOv5s. Batch normalization is a preprocessing step that scales the output of a convolution layer to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can help train the model faster and accelerate the learning process.

Other than batch normalization, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or normalization. It is likely that these steps are important preprocessing steps, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is batch normalization. Other preprocessing steps may be involved, but they are not mentioned in the context.
