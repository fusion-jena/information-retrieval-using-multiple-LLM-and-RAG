According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve). 

The accuracy of candidate models is measured using the proportion of correctly classified cases, as stated in Table 1. On the other hand, the performance of the selected models is measured using the AUC. This is evident in the tables provided, where the accuracy of candidate models is listed as a percentage, and the AUC of the selected models is provided as a separate value. There is no mention of precision and recall as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
