The hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model are optimized using an alternate method of successive screening, which is different from traditional methods such as grid search or random search. This method is used to determine the optimal parameter M, which is the number of variables to try at each split. The internal RF function TuneRF is used to calculate the optimal number of variables starting from the default value and finds the value with the minimum Out-of-Bag (OOB) error rate below and above the threshold value (i.e., one-third of the total number of variables for regression).
