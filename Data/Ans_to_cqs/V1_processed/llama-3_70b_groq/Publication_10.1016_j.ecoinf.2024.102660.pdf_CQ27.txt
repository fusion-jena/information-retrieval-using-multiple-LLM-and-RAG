I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the data acquisition and processing, network structure, parameter setting, evaluation metric, and performance of the Res_AUNet network, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
