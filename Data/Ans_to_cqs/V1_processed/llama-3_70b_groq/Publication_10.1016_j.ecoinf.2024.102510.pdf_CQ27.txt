I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance comparison of different models, hyperparameter optimization, and transfer learning. It discusses the experimental results, accuracy, and performance of various models, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
