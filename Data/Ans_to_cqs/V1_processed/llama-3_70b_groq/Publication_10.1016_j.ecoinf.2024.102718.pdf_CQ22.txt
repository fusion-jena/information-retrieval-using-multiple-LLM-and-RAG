The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include accuracy, loss, area under the curve (AUC), Cohen's Kappa (CK), precision, recall, F1 score, model size, inference time, FLOP count, and analysis time. 

Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances in the dataset. Loss measures the error between predicted and actual values in a model. AUC represents the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Cohen's Kappa measures the agreement between two raters classifying items into mutually exclusive categories. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances in the dataset. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. 

Model size refers to the size of the trained model, usually measured in terms of parameters or memory footprint. Inference time measures the time taken by the model to process a single input and generate an output prediction. FLOP count represents the number of arithmetic operations performed by the model during inference or training. Analysis time measures the time taken by the model to process a given dataset or perform a specific task.
