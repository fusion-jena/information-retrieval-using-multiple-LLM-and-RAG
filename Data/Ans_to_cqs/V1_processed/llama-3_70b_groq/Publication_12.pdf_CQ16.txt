Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text describes the training process, including the number of epochs (50-60 times) and the duration (2 hours and 10 minutes), but it does not specify the stopping criteria, such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
