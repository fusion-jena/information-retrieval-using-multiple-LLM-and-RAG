Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the context mentions ResNet, RepVGG, and MobileNet-V3, which are all types of CNN architectures. ResNet is a well-known CNN architecture that addresses the degradation problem in deep neural networks. RepVGG is a variant of ResNet that uses a re-parameterization technique to decouple the training-time multi-branch and inference-time plain architecture. MobileNet-V3 is another type of CNN architecture that is designed for mobile devices. The context also mentions the use of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to build and train these CNN models. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
