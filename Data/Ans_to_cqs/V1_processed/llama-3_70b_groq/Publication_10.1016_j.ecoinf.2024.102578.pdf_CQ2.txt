Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the use of images from camera traps for wildlife monitoring and the application of deep learning models, such as ResNet-50 and MegaDetector, for image classification. It does not provide information about the specific data formats used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
