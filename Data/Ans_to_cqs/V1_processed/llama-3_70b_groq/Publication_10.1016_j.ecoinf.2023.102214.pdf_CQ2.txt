Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods for individual ID in snow leopard research, image classification, and camera trapping image analysis. It mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image characteristics, but it does not provide information about the specific data formats used.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the deep learning pipeline, as the research involves image classification and camera trapping image analysis. But the exact data format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) is not specified. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a format commonly used for tabular data, but it is not mentioned in the context.

In summary, while image data is likely used in the deep learning pipeline, the specific data formats (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV) are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
