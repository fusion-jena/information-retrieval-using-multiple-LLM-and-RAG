I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of artificial neural networks, specifically the NARX model and a hybrid model combining wavelet analysis and NARX ANN, for predicting vegetation biomass density. It discusses the performance evaluation of these models using metrics such as R-value, MAPE, RMSE, and MSE, but does not provide information on optimization techniques used during the training process.
