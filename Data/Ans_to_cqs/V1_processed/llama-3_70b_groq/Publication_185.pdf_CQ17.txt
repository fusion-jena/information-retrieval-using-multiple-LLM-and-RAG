Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are L2 weight decay with a penalty multiplier set to 5 Ã— 10-4 and dropout with a ratio set to 0.5. These methods were applied to the model during training to prevent overfitting and improve its generalization performance.
