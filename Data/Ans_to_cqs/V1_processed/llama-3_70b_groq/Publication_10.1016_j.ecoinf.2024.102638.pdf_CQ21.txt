Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training are not explicitly mentioned. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, hyperparameter optimization, and performance evaluation using various metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and MASE. 

However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved, as the context mentions the evaluation of performance metrics in Section 2.5 and the selection of the most effective models based on these metrics. 

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices, which are typically used for model interpretability and performance evaluation in classification tasks, respectively. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these steps are involved in the postprocessing phase.
