Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the comparison of the CNN model with the BIOCLIM model, the architecture of the CNN model, and the evaluation metrics used to assess its performance. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
