The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a hybrid model that combines a Transformer with a CNN backbone, specifically a ResNet. This is mentioned in the context as "a hybrid design that couples the Transformer with a CNN backbone (such as ResNet)". The Transformer is used to model global attention using the features extracted by the ResNet. This hybrid approach is shown to deliver better performance with relatively less computing work compared to the vanilla ViT model.
