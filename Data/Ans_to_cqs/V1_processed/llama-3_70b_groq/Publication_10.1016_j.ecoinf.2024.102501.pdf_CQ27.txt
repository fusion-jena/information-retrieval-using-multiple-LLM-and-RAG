I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses various research papers and studies on predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water using different machine learning and deep learning techniques, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
