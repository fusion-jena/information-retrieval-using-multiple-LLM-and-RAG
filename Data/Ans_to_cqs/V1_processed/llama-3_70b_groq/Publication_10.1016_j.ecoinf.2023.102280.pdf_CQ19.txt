The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The text discusses various deep learning-based denoising methods, their applications, and challenges, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models.

The context mentions U-net architecture, transformer attention mechanisms, and convolutional networks, which are general concepts in deep learning. However, it does not specify the programming frameworks or libraries used to implement these models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
