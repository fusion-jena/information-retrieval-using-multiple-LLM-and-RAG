The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that the dataset has been "highly annotated" and that this annotation allows for easy evaluation and training of the auto-encoder on a higher proportion of non-silent audio clips. It does not provide details on the annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the specific annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
