Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on artificial neural networks, their applications, and related studies in ecology, biology, and environmental science. It discusses the importance of selecting the right parameters for ANN models, such as the number of layers, neurons, learning rates, and epochs, and provides references to various studies that utilize ANNs for predicting species richness, fish distribution, and mosquito abundance.

However, it can be inferred that the studies mentioned in the context might have used various methods for collecting raw data, such as:

* Hydroacoustic surveys (Brosse et al., 1999)
* Weather data (Chuang et al., 2012; Lebl et al., 2013)
* Public datasets (not explicitly mentioned, but possible)
* Sensors (not explicitly mentioned, but possible)

It is essential to note that the context does not provide a comprehensive answer to the query, and the methods used for collecting raw data might vary depending on the specific study or application.
