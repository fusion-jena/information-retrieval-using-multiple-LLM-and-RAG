The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning and selection process for various machine learning models, including XGB, RF, ET, LGBM, and GB, to predict water quality parameters (WQPs) such as nitrate and dissolved oxygen (DO). 

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely regression-based, as the evaluation metrics mentioned are coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE), which are commonly used in regression tasks. The models are being used to predict continuous values of water quality parameters, rather than classification, segmentation, or detection tasks.
