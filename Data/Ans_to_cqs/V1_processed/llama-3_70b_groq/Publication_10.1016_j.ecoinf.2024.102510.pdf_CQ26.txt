The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the importance of considering the limitations and potential biases of the training dataset and the need to collect more comprehensive and diverse datasets to better reflect the true variability of bird species.

The context does mention data augmentation as a technique to address the issue of overfitting and improve the generalization of deep learning models. Data augmentation involves applying transformations, such as flipping, translation, and shear, to the existing data to expand the dataset and maintain dataset balance. This can help reduce the impact of data bias, but it is not a direct technique to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
