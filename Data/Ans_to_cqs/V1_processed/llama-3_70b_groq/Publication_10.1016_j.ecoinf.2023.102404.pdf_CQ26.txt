Based on the provided context, it appears that stratified random sampling was used to address data bias during preprocessing of the machine learning pipeline. Specifically, the authors used this approach to capture the full distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps accurately. This technique was chosen to ensure that the training and testing datasets accurately represented the distribution of AGB values in the study area.

There is no mention of other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being used to address data bias. It is possible that these techniques may have been used, but it is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

It is worth noting that the context primarily focuses on machine learning models, particularly decision tree-based models, and does not explicitly discuss deep learning pipelines. Therefore, it is unclear whether the techniques used to address data bias in this context would be applicable to deep learning pipelines.
