The context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a leave-one-out cross-validation was carried out, which involves removing a single bird from the dataset for each species, training the model on the other birds, and then validating the model on the single bird. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria or ratio for this split is not specified.
