Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, but it does not provide specific details on the methods used to ensure generalizability.

However, it does mention the importance of considering the number and spatial distribution of samples, as well as the influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms, to create a representative dataset and make a ML-based model with acceptable generalization. This suggests that the authors recognize the importance of dataset quality and diversity in ensuring model generalizability, but the specific measures taken to achieve this are not described.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query, as the necessary information is not available in the provided context.
