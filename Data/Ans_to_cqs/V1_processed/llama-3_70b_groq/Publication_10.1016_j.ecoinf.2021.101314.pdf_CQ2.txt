I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. The context appears to be discussing ecological informatics, specifically about selecting individual redescriptions for further analysis, and it mentions variables related to dental traits and bioclimatic variables. There is no mention of deep learning or data formats, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
