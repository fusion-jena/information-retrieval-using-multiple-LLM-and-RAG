Based on the provided context, it appears that bounding box annotation is one of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the sentence: "For step-2, the training dataset contains 700 aerial images, with whales and background, in which each whale is annotated within a bounding box (the total number of bounding boxes is 945)."

However, there is no mention of instance segmentation as a data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that other annotation techniques may be used, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer is that bounding box annotation is one of the data annotation techniques used, but it is unclear if instance segmentation or other techniques are also used.
