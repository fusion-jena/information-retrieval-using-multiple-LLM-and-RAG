I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is stored. It discusses the importance of splitting data into training, validation, and test sets, and provides references to various papers and tools related to deep learning, such as Keras, TensorFlow, and Imagenet. However, it does not provide information about the data repository used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
