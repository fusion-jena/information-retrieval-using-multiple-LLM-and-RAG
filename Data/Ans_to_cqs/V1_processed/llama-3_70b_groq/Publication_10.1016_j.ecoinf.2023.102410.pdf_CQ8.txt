I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, and it discusses data analysis and visualization, but it does not provide information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that "The link to the data is shared in the manuscript" but does not provide any information about the code used to analyze the data. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
