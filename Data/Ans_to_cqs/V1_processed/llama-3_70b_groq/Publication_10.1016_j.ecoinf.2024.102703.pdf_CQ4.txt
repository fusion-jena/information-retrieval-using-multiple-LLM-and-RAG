I don't know. The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context describes a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network built using MATLAB R2014b for predicting Total Suspended Iron (TSI) from aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) inputs. It discusses the network architecture, training parameters, and evaluation metrics, but does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
