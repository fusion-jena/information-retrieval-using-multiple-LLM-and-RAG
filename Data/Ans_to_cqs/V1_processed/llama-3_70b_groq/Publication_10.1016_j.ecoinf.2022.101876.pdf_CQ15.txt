The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the Faster R-CNN model, its application in object detection, and the MegaDetector model's performance in detecting objects in images. It does not delve into the details of the optimization techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
