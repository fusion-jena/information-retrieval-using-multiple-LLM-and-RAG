The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the importance of data sharing, regulation, and the scarcity of entomological big data resources. It also mentions the use of deep learning for computer vision in estimating arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity, as well as automatic insect detection. However, it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
