I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to permafrost modeling, geohazard indices, and Bayesian networks, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
