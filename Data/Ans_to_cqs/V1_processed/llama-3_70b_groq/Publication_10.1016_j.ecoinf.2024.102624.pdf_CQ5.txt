The provided context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears to be discussing a classification problem involving spectral bands, spectral indices, and texture indices as input datasets. The context mentions 10 variable sets (Table 2) used for classification with three classifiers (RF, SVM, and MARS) and two sets of classes (7C and 13C). The input datasets used are combinations of variables such as spectral bands (green, red, red edge, NIR), spectral indices (NDVI, vNDVI, NDRE, DSM), and texture indices (nine variations of the texture index, Run Percentage, with three kernel and three offset options in all combinations).
