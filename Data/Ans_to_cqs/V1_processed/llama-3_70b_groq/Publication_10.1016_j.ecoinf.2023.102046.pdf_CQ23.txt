The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that dataset imbalance was dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function, which can help improve the model's performance on underrepresented classes.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model with the smallest validation loss was used for evaluation on the test set, which implies that some form of validation or testing was performed to evaluate the model's performance. However, it does not provide further details on how the validation or testing was performed.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of pre-trained models (ViT, ResNet, and Inception-V3) that were trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset. This could potentially help improve the model's generalizability to new, unseen data.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information on measures taken to ensure generalizability, it does suggest that some efforts were made to address dataset imbalance and that pre-trained models were used, which could help improve the model's performance on new data.
