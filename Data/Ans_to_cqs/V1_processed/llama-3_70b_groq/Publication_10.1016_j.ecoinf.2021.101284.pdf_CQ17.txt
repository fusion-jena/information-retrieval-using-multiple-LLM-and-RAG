The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on various studies related to COVID-19, air pollution, and data analysis, but it does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline or regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
