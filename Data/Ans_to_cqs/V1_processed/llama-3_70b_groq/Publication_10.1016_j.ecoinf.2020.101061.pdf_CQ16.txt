I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the experimental design, data availability, and results of a study on using deep learning for tree detection in airborne imagery. It mentions the use of different proportions of training data, cross-site predictions, and transfer learning, but it does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau.
