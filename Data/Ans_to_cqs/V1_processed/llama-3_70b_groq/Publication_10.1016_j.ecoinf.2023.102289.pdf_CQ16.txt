I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a model or determining when training is complete. It discusses the LaDeco platform, which uses a pre-trained model (deeplabv3 Ã¾ resnet269) for semantic segmentation, and explains how to load the model, set a threshold, and output the results in CSV format. It also provides an example of the output template. However, it does not provide any information about the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
