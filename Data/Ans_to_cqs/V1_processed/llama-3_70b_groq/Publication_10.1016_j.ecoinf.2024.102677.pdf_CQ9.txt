I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is available. The sources mentioned in Table 1 are websites that provide data for GDP, NTL, and NPP, but they are not data repositories for the deep learning pipeline. The context does not provide any information about where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository where the data is available.
