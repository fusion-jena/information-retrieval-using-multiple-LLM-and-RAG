I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context discusses deep learning, data augmentation, and attention mechanisms, but it does not provide information about specific datasets used in the pipeline. The figures mentioned, such as Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, appear to be related to the proposed approach for identifying medicinal plants, but they do not provide information about the datasets used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
