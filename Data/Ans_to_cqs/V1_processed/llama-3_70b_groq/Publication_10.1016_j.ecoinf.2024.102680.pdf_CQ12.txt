The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and Transformer. This is evident from the mention of YOLOv8, which is a CNN-based object detection model, and the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution, which are techniques commonly used in CNNs. Additionally, the paper also mentions the use of a Transformer detector, specifically RT-DETR, which is a Transformer-based object detection model.
