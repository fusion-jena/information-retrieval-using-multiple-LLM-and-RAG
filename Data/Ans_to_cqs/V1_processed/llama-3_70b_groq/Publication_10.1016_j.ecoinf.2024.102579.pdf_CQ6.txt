Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to forestry and ecological informatics, discussing estimators and their performances in forest inventory analysis. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
