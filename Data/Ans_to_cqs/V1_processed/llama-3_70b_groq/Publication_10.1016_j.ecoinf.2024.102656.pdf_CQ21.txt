Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved.

The context mentions that "Evaluation and comparative analyses were conducted for both individual models and the ensemble model via two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS)". This suggests that metrics calculation is a postprocessing step, where the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as AUC and TSS.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix as postprocessing steps in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these steps are involved or not.

In summary, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed based on the provided context is metrics calculation.
