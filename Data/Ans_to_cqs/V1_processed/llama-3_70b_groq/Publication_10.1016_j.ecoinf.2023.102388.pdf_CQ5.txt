I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to image recognition, membership inference attacks, and deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention the datasets used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
