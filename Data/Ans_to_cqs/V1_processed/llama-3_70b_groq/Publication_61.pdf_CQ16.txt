The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the experimental characterization of the proposed approach, including the hyperparameters used for training, such as the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size. However, it does not specify how the training process is terminated or what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.

In general, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, where the validation loss stops decreasing or reaches a certain threshold, or a maximum number of epochs is reached. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular experiment.
