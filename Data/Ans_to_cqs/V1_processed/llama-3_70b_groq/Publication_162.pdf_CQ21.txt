The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the system's architecture, data collection, and preprocessing steps. It discusses the use of active learning, novelty detection, and image analysis, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the query. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
