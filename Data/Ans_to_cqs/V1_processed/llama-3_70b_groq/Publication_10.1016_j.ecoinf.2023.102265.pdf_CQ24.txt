Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on image classification, feature extraction, and model selection using ResNet models. It discusses the performance of different ResNet models, feature visualization using t-SNE, and classifier model training and validation. 

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout. By setting a random seed value, researchers can ensure that their results are reproducible and comparable across different runs.

In the absence of explicit information on handling randomness in the provided context, it is unclear whether the authors employed any specific strategies to handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline.
