I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for agricultural pest recognition, but it does not include any references to a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to determine where the code is available.
