I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or others. It only mentions the requirement for "computational infrastructure" and "compute cycles" to support the training of DL algorithms. However, it does not provide details on the specific hardware components used to fulfill these requirements. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this query.
