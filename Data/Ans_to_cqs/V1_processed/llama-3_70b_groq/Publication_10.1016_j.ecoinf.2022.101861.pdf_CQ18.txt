I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to bird research, citizen science, and automated signal recognition software, but it does not provide information about a specific model or its training process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
