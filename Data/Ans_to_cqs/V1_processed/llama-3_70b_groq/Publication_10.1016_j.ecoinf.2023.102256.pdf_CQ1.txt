Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the CNN model, the use of spectrograms as input, and the incorporation of metadata into the model. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

The section "3.1. Data collection" is present in the context, but it does not provide any details on the methods used for collecting the data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
