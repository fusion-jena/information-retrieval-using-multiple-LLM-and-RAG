I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the MaxEnt model are optimized. It discusses the model's output, the variables used, and the methods for estimating the relative contributions of the environmental and territorial variables to the model. It also provides references to other studies, but none of them mention hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot determine how the hyperparameters are optimized based on the provided context.
