Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it can be inferred that some form of refinement or filtering is applied to the output of the Siamese network to suppress false-positive detections and filter background interference. This is mentioned in the context of the refinement module, which integrates the relation detector into the Siamese framework.

Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of a refined classification confidence score using a convolution operation, which might be a postprocessing step. However, there is no mention of specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and more information would be required to determine the exact postprocessing steps involved after model training.
