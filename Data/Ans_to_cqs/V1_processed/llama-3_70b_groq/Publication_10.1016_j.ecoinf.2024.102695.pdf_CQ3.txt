I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on a specific deep learning model for predicting multivariate marine chemical data, and it discusses the model's architecture, attention mechanisms, and formulas for calculating attention weights. There is no mention of data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
