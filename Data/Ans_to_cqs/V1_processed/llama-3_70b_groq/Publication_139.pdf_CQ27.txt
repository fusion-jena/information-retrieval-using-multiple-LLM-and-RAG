Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the training database assembly, generating prediction records, collecting weather data, and the use of pre-trained architectures, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
