I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on ecological research, remote sensing, and data preparation/scaling, with mentions of Random Forests and Boruta permutations. However, these are not related to deep learning or handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
