I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, dataset, and results of the hierarchical mapping of Brazilian Savanna physiognomies using deep learning techniques. It discusses the data augmentation techniques, sample generation, and semantic segmentation approach used, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters of the deep learning model.
