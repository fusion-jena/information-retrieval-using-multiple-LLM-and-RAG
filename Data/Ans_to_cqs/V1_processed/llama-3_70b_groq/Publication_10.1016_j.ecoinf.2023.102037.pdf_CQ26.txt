The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses data splitting and image tiling, but it does not provide information on how to address data bias.

However, it is mentioned that the authors have shown in their previous research that model performance can be highly overestimated when weak validation procedures, such as random data splitting, are followed. This implies that the authors are aware of the importance of addressing data bias, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in this context.
