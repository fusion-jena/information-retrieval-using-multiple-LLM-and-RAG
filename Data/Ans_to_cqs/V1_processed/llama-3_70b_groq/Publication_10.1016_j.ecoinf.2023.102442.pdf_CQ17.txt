I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and environmental studies, with a focus on detecting artisanal small-scale mining and analyzing Amazonian rainforests. While some of the papers mention the use of deep learning and convolutional neural networks, they do not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
