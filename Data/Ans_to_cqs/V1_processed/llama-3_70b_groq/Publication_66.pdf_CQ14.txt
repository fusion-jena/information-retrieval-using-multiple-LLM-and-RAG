The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a random hyperparameter search. This is stated in the text as "A random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure." This means that the model's hyperparameters, such as the number of layers and hidden nodes per layer, were varied randomly to find the best combination that resulted in the highest model performance.
