The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a ResNext-101 model. This is mentioned in section 2.2.1 of the context, which describes the DCNN model architecture used in the experiments. The ResNext-101 model is a member of the ResNeXt family of models, which combines the advantages of the ResNet and InceptionV3 models.
