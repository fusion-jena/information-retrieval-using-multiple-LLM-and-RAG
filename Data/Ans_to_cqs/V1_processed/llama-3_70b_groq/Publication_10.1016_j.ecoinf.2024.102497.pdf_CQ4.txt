I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on bathymetry retrieval methods, remote sensing data, and water environment analysis. It discusses various models and techniques used for bathymetry estimation, such as linear regression, CART, RFR, SVM, and SVR, but does not mention data augmentation techniques or deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
