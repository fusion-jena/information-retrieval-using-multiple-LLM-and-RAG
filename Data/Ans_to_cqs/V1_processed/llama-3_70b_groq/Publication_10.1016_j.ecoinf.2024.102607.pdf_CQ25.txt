The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification, specifically land use and land cover (LULC) mapping and crop mapping. The models mentioned, such as random forests, support vector machines, decision trees, and artificial neural networks, are used for classification tasks. The goal is to classify different land cover types, such as crops, from remote sensing imagery. The models are trained on labeled datasets and then used to predict the class labels of new, unseen data.
