I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture and implementation of the CNN model, specifically the ResNet50 model, and its application to bioacoustic tasks. It also mentions other datasets and models, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
