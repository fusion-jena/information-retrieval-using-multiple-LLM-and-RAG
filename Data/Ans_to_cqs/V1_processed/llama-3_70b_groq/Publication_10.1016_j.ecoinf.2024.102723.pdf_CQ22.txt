The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), and Normalized Mean Prediction Interval Width (NMPIW). Additionally, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is also mentioned as a metric used for evaluation. These metrics are used to assess the quality of the model's predictions, with SMAPE and NMPIW providing a measure of the quality of prediction intervals in relation to the variability of the observed data.
