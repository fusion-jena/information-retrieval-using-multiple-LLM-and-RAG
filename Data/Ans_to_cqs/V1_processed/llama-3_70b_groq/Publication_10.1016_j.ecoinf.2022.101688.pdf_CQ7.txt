According to the provided context, the data was split into training (60%) and testing (40%) sets by randomly selecting entire audio files. The training audio files were mutually exclusive to the testing audio files, and the testing files were generally recordings over different days. There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide explicit criteria for splitting the data, but rather describes the process of splitting the data in a way that ensures a fair evaluation. The split is done randomly, and the training and testing sets are made mutually exclusive to prevent any overlap between the two.
