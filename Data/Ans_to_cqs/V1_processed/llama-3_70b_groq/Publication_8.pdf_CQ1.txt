The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for image processing and feature extraction from digitized herbarium sheets. It does not provide information on how the raw data (images of herbarium sheets) was collected.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the raw data might have been collected through digitization of herbarium sheets, which could involve scanning or photographing the physical sheets. But the exact method of data collection is not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
