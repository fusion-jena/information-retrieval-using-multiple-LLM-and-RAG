Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, specifically the PTDLEN-VAE model. This is mentioned in the first passage, which discusses the computation time analysis of the PTDLEN-VAE model on the AID dataset. Additionally, the context explains the architecture of a VAE model, which is a type of deep learning model.

However, it's worth noting that the context also mentions other deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are used in other related works. For example, the paper by Liu et al. (2020) uses feature-augmented convolutional neural nets for satellite image classification. Similarly, the paper by Li et al. (2020) combines a convolutional neural network and a graph neural network for multi-label remote sensing image scene classification.

Therefore, while the primary model used in the pipeline is a VAE model, the context suggests that other deep learning models, such as CNNs and GNNs, are also relevant in the field of satellite image classification.
