Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses audio data formats. The text mentions "audio representations such as spectrograms" and "mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) can be represented as a single-channel image." This suggests that the pipeline is working with audio data, which is being converted into spectrogram or MFCC representations for processing. Additionally, the mention of "1-D waveform" in the context of HuBERT model further supports the idea that the pipeline is dealing with audio data. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
