I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing urban acoustic ecology, sound event classification, and psychoacoustics, with a focus on analyzing large datasets of urban acoustic environments. It does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
