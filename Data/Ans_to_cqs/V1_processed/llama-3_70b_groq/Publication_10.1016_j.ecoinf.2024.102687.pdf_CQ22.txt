The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are DBCV (Density-Based Clustering Validation), ARI (Adjusted Rand Index), and AMI (Adjusted Mutual Information). These metrics are used to evaluate the quality of clustering and determine the optimal CNN backbone for fine-tuning the model without knowledge of the ground truth labels.
