I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing a workflow for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, but it does not provide information about the implementation or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
