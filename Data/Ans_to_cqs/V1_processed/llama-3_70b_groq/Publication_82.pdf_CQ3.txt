I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context only discusses the experimental configurations, including the choice of deep learning architecture, training mechanism, dataset type, and training-testing set distribution. It also provides some details about the hyperparameters used for training and the framework used for conducting the experiments. However, it does not provide any information about data annotation techniques.
