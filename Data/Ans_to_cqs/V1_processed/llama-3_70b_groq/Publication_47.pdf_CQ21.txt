The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text only discusses the training process of the IUC-NN model, including the data splitting, cross-validation, and model selection. It does not provide information on what happens after the model is trained.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved, such as whether saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices were used. The context only focuses on the model training and prediction of conservation status, without detailing the subsequent analysis or visualization steps.
