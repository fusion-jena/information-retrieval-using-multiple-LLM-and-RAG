The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the authors used a diverse dataset, specifically the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset, which includes a Brazil extract that was used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. This suggests that the authors attempted to ensure generalizability by testing the model on a separate dataset that was not included in the training process.

Additionally, the authors used dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP and t-SNE to analyze the embeddings generated by the models. This could be seen as a way to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and to identify potential biases or limitations.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
