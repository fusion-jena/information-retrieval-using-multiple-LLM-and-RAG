Based on the provided context, it appears that crowd-sourcing involving non-expert users is one method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. This is mentioned in the text by Sharma et al. (2017), where they used crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation of karyotyping images of chromosomes.

Additionally, the context does not provide explicit information on other methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data. However, it does mention the use of light microscopy datasets in the context of automated tracing of neurons, as mentioned in the BigNeuron resource paper by Gillette et al. (2023).

It is also possible that other methods such as image segmentation programs, like DSeg, may be used to extract patterns from images, as mentioned in the paper by Zhang et al. (2019). However, it is not clear if these programs are used for collecting raw data or for processing existing data.

In summary, based on the provided context, crowd-sourcing and light microscopy datasets are two methods that may be utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide explicit information on other methods, and further research may be needed to determine the full range of methods used for collecting raw data.
