Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for land-cover classification and land use/land cover changes using satellite imagery. It discusses the importance of labeling data, model training, and classification, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
