The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as R2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MAE. The models are trained and tested on separate datasets, and the performance metrics are reported for both the training and testing datasets. Additionally, the context mentions that the hyperparameters of the models are tuned using grid search, which suggests that the model performance is monitored and optimized during the training process. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned.
