Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are YOLO training losses and mAP50 values. The mAP50 value indicates the highest number of correctly predicted labels for the model trained on a specific split. Additionally, the classification loss (cls loss) is also used, which measures the error in the predicted class probabilities for each object in the image compared with the ground truth. This value is computed using a cross-entropy loss function. 

However, it does not mention other common metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
