Based on the provided context, it appears that stratified sampling was employed to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Specifically, the composite numerical dataset was split into 80% (240 data rows) for training the model and 20% (60 data rows) for testing. This stratified sampling approach helps to maintain the same proportion of classes in both the training and testing datasets, which can improve the model's generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or the use of a diverse dataset in the provided context. It is possible that these measures were not taken or were not mentioned in the text.
