Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in BirdNET. The context primarily focuses on the functionality and capabilities of BirdNET, its application, and the settings used for the detection and classification of bird vocalizations. It does not provide information on the dataset used to train the model, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques employed to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
