The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error, and the parameter settings of the MLP model are listed in Table 2. However, it does not provide information on the optimization method used, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
