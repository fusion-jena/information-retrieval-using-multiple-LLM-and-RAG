The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of graded MSE convergence. This is mentioned in the text as "graded MSE convergence (Figs. 7 to 11) has been adopted to fine-tune the model." This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training by tracking the mean squared error (MSE) and adjusting the model's parameters to achieve convergence. Additionally, the use of various plots such as the confusion matrix, F1 curve, P curve, PR curve, and R curve (Figs. 6-10) also helps to monitor the model's performance during training.
