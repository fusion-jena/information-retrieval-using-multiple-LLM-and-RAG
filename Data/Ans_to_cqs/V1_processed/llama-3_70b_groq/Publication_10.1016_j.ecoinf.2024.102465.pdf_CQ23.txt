Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on citing various research papers and providing a brief overview of the experiment, including the utilization of the pre-trained "ERNIE" model and the comparative analysis of different models for sentiment task analysis. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques employed to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
