The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as precision and recall. However, it does mention the error rate, accuracy, training loss, and validation loss. 

Specifically, the context states that the initial model achieved an error rate of 11.95% and an accuracy of 94.8% (which implies an error rate of 5.2%) after fine-tuning. It also mentions the training loss and validation loss at different stages of the model's development. 

While accuracy is mentioned, precision and recall are not explicitly stated. Therefore, it can be concluded that the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include accuracy, error rate, training loss, and validation loss, but it is unclear whether precision and recall were used.
