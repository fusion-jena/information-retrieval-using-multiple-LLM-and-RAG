Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the limitations of existing plant datasets, the importance of deep learning in plant identification, and the visualization of feature maps in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
