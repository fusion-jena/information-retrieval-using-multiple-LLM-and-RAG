The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The tables and sections provided discuss the hyperparameters used for each basic model, the classification performance of the models, and the proposed ensemble methods, but they do not describe the optimization process for the hyperparameters. 

It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using a method such as grid search or random search, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided information.
