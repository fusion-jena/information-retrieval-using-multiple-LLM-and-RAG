I don't know.

The provided context does not mention training or validation loss plateau, which are typically concepts related to machine learning model training. The context appears to be discussing image segmentation and classification using eCognition, and it mentions the use of machine learning techniques, but it does not provide information on how to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
