Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on particle filters, Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods, and parallel computing, with references to various papers and books on these topics.

However, it is common knowledge in the field of machine learning that preprocessing steps are essential before training a deep learning model. Typical preprocessing steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Data normalization: scaling numerical features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Data scaling: transforming features to have similar scales, often using techniques like standardization or feature scaling
* Data transformation: converting data types, handling categorical variables, and performing feature engineering
* Data augmentation: artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data

These preprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. However, without explicit information in the provided context, I cannot provide more specific details on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
