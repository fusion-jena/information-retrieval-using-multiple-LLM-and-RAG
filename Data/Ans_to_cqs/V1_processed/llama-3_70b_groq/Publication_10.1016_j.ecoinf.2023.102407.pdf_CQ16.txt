Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the AUC (Area Under the Curve) score on the validation set. Specifically, it is mentioned that "K was selected empirically based on the AUC of SDP-EPL on the validation set." This suggests that the training process is monitored and stopped when the AUC score on the validation set reaches a certain threshold or plateau.

However, it is not explicitly stated in the provided context whether a specific validation loss plateau is used as a stopping criterion. The context only mentions that the AUC score is used to evaluate the performance of the model and to select the hyperparameter K. Therefore, it is unclear whether other criteria, such as validation loss, are used in addition to AUC.
