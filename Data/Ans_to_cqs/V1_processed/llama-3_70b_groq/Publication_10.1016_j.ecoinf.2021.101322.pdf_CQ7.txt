Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context only mentions the use of minibatch gradient descent during training and the assessment of CNN model performance using four different metrics (test loss, MSE, MAPE, and accuracy) on an independent dataset. It also provides the performance metrics for the CNN models on different tasks, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
