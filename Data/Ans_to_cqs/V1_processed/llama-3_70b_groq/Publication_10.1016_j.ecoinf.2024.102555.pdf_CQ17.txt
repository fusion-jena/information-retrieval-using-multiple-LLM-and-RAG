I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to environmental and ecological studies, discussing topics such as flood susceptibility mapping, dry-wet variations, burned area mapping, and vegetation growth. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
