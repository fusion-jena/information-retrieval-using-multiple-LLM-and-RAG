I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, agriculture, and environmental science, with a focus on detecting plant diseases, monitoring vegetation health, and identifying pest damage using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. While some of the papers mention the use of machine learning algorithms such as CNN, back propagation neural networks, and multi-scale attention-UNet models, they do not discuss regularization methods specifically. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
