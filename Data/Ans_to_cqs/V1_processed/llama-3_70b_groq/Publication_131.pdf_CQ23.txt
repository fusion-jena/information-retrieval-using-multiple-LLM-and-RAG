According to the provided context, the measure taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model is the use of a strategy where 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20% as tests. This is a common approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization of a machine learning model. Additionally, a balanced sampling was carried out for the test set, where one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was selected for each type of anuran call. This ensures that the test set is representative of the different classes and helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. There is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context.
