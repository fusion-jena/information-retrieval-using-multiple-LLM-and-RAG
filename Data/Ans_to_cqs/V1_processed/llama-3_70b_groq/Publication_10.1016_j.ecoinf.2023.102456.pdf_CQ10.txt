I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing a model for forest fire simulation using cellular automata and machine learning. It provides mathematical equations, references to other research papers, and descriptions of the model's architecture, but it does not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
