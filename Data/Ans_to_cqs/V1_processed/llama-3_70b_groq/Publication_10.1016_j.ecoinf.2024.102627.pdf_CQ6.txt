The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some post-processing steps, such as removing predictions outside the continents where species are known to occur and normalizing conditional probabilities associated with orchids (Section 3.2.2).

It is also mentioned that the model uses a large environmental context around each observation, including various predictors such as WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude) (Section 2.1.2). However, it does not specify whether these predictors are normalized, scaled, or cleaned before being used as input to the model.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
