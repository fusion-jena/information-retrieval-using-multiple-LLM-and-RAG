I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context appears to be a list of references related to ecology, climate, and statistical computing, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
