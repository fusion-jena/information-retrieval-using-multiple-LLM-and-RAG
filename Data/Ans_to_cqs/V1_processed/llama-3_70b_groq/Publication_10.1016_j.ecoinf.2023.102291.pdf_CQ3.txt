I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research article on automated detection of humpback whale songs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used. The text mentions the use of CNN architectures, training library sizes, and inference times, but it does not discuss data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
