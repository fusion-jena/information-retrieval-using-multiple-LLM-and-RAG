The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on feature elimination and model performance in the context of predicting relative tsetse fly numbers using random forest models and satellite-based variables.

However, it does mention feature elimination techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF), which can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and potentially mitigate the effects of data bias. But it does not specifically discuss techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not addressed in the given text.
