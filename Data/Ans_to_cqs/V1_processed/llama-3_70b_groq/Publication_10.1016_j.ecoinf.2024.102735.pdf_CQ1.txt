According to the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through sensors. Specifically, a YSI multiparameter sonde was strategically positioned at Boyd Millpond's outlet to measure various water quality parameters, including pH, temperature, specific conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, saturated dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, and chlorophyll-a levels. The sensor took readings at approximately 15-minute intervals, resulting in a large dataset of 155,914 measurements. There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in this context.
