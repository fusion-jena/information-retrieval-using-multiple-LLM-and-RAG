Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data augmentation method used to create effective variation in the training data, but it does not discuss how the initial raw data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
