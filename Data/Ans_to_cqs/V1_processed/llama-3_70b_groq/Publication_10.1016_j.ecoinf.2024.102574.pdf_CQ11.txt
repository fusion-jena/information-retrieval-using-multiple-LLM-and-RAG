I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository link. The context appears to be a list of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, forestry, and ecology, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
