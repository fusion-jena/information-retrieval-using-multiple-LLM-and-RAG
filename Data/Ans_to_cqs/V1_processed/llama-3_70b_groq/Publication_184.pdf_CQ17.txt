The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that data augmentation was used, which acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting. 

Data augmentation involves creating adjusted copies of existing data, such as horizontally flipping, grayscaling, blurring, adding noise, and cropping images. This technique helps extend the amount of information available and reduces the risk of overfitting. 

While data augmentation is not a traditional regularization method like dropout or L2 regularization, it serves a similar purpose in preventing overfitting. However, it is not possible to determine from the provided context whether other regularization methods were used in addition to data augmentation.
