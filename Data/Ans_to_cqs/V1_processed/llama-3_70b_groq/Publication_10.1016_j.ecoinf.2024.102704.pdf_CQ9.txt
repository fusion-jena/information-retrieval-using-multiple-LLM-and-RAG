I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects of deep learning models, such as optimizing off-chip memory accesses, fish passage monitoring, object detection networks, and multiple fish tracking. It also cites several research papers and conferences, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
