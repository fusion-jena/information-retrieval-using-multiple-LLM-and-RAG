I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to research on ecosystem services, food supply, and agricultural systems, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository. The mentioned references are academic papers and do not include a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
