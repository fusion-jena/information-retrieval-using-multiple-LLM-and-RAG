The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are the Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS). These metrics are used to assess the performance of the model predictions. The AUC and TSS values are reported to be greater than 0.90 and 0.80, respectively, for predicting current suitable areas.
