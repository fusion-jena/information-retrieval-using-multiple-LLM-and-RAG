According to the provided context, the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation, 64 GB memory, and an NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory. The operating system used is Debian 4.195.98-1 version. The context also mentions that the experiments were performed under a 10.0 CUDA version, which is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA that allows developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general-purpose computing. Therefore, the primary hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is the NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU.
