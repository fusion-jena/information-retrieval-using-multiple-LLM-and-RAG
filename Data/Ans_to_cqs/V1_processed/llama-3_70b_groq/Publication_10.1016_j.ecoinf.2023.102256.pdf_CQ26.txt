The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "class imbalance" in the reference "Johnson, J.M., Khoshgoftaar, T.M., 2019. Survey on deep learning with class imbalance." This suggests that the authors are aware of the issue of class imbalance, which is a type of data bias.

However, the context does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
