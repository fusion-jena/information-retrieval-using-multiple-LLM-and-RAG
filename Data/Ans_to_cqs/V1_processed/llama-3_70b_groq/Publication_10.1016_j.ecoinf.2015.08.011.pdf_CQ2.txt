The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning or specific data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. The context appears to be focused on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their application in predicting fish distribution, mosquito abundance, and other environmental-related topics. The data used in these studies seems to be in the form of numerical or categorical data, but the specific format is not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
