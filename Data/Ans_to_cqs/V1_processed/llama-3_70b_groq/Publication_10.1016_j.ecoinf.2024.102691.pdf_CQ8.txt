I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the model architecture, training parameters, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about where the code is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
