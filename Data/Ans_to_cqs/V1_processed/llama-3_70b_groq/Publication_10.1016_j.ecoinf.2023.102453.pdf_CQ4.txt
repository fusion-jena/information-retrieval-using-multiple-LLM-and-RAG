The context provided does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training dataset could be pre-processed, such as denoising, contrast enhancement, and image resizing. Image resizing is the only technique that was actually used to make the images suitable for the input image resolution required for the selected models. There is no mention of other data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
