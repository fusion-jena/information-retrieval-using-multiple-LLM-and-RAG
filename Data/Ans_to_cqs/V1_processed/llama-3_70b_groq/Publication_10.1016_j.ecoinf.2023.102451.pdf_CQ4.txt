The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that data augmentation is performed as a preprocessing step to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks (section b). It does not provide details on the specific techniques used, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. Therefore, I don't know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this pipeline.
