The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "some model parameters or hyperparameters were varied to evaluate the performance of the given model" and that "parameter tuning was limited to a few hyperparameters because of the large number of parameters in the CNN model". It also lists the varied hyperparameters as the optimization algorithm or optimizer, learning rate, and dropout layer. However, it does not specify the optimization method used to select the best combination of these hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
