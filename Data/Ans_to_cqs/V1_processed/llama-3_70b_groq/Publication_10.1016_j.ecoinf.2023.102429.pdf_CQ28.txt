I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model on any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be related to a research paper on estimating soil properties using spectral data and various machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
