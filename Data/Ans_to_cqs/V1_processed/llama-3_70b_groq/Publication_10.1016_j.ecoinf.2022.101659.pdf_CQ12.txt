I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning models, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, being used in a pipeline. The text appears to discuss valve gaping in bivalves, its relationship with metabolic functions, and the potential for using sensors and big data to improve predictions and decision-making in aquaculture. It also mentions the need for further experimentation and modeling to better understand the linkages between gaping activity and clearance rate, respiration rates, and energy consumption. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or any specific pipeline.
