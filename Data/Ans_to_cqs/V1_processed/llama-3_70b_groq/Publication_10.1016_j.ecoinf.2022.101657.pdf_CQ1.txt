Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are used to collect raw data in the deep learning pipeline for biodiversity monitoring. The context mentions "camera trap data" and "images obtained from camera traps" several times, indicating that camera traps are the primary method of data collection.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for data collection. Sensors are mentioned in the context of camera traps with PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors, which are used to capture images at dusk and night.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the data collection process, and it is possible that other methods may be used in addition to camera traps. However, based on the provided information, camera traps appear to be the primary method of data collection.
