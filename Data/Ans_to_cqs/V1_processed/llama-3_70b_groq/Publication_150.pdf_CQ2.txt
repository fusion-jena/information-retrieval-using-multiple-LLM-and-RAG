Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data formats. The context mentions ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database, and discusses the performance of various convolutional neural network (CNN) models, including InceptionV3, Wide-ResNet, and MnasNet, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the context. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
