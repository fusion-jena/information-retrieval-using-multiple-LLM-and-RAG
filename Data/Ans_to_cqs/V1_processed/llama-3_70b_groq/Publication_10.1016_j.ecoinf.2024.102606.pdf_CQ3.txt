The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The section on "Digitization and annotation" (2.1) does not provide details on the annotation techniques used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other techniques were used.
