Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image processing, specifically for object detection and segmentation tasks using Mask R-CNN. The image shape is mentioned as [a, 640, 640, 3], where 'a' is the number of training images, and the mask shape is [a, 640, 640, 1]. This suggests that the data format used in the pipeline is image data, likely in a format such as JPEG or PNG.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a format typically used for tabular data, which is not relevant to the image processing tasks described in the context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
