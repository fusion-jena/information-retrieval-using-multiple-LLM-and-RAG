Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline involves the following data formats:

* Image: The context mentions the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest, which involves classifying high-resolution images into 1000 different classes. This suggests that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline.
* Audio: The context mentions speech recognition and audio signal analysis, indicating that audio data is also used in the pipeline.

There is no explicit mention of video data formats in the provided context. However, it is possible that video data may be used in certain deep learning applications, especially those involving computer vision tasks.

As for CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, there is no mention of them in the provided context. CSV files are typically used for storing and exchanging tabular data, and may not be directly related to the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, based on the provided context, are image and audio.
