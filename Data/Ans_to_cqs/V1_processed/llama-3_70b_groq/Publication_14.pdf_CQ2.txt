Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses video data formats. This is evident from the description of the DeepMeerkat GUI, which allows users to select a file or directory of videos to screen using a pre-trained model. Additionally, the text mentions that images were collected for training a fine-tuned neural network, suggesting that image data is also used in the pipeline. However, there is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used.
