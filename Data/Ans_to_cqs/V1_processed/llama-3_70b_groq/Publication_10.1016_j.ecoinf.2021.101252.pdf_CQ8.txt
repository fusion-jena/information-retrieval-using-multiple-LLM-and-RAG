I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning and AutoML in earth system science, and it includes references to various research papers and articles, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I am unable to determine where the code repository is available.
