Based on the provided context, the deep learning models mentioned are Unet, Deeplabv3+, and Pspnet. These models are all variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, Unet is an encoder-decoder architecture with shortcut connections, Deeplabv3+ uses an encoder-decoder structure with an ASPP module, and Pspnet employs a spatial pyramid module. None of the mentioned models are RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) or Transformers. Therefore, the answer is CNN.
