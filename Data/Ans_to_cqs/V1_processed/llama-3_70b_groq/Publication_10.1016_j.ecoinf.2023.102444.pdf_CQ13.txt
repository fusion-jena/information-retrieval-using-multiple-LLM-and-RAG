I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of UMAP (a dimensionality reduction method) and MaxEnt (a species distribution modeling method) to analyze bioclimatic variables and species distribution. It mentions the hyperparameters used in UMAP, such as the number of neighbors and minimum distance, but does not provide information about a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
