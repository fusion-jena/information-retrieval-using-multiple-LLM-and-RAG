The provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The system specification details presented in Table 1 only mention the Central Processing Unit (CPU) as Intel(R)Core i7-4790@ 3.6GHz, Operating System as Microsoft Windows, Random Access Memory (RAM) as 16GB, and System Architecture as 64bit. There is no mention of any specialized hardware for deep learning model training. Therefore, it can be inferred that the model was trained using the CPU, but it is not clear if any GPU or TPU was used.
