The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context discusses various deep learning models, including AlexNet, MobileNet, and ResNet, and their applications in image classification tasks, particularly in plant image classification. However, it does not specify the datasets used to train or test these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
