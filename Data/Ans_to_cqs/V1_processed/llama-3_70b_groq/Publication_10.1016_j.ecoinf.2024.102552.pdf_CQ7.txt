I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The text discusses the use of machine learning tools for classification, but it does not provide specific information about the data splitting process. It mentions the use of NAIP and massive training datasets, but it does not explain how the data is divided into training, testing, and validation sets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
