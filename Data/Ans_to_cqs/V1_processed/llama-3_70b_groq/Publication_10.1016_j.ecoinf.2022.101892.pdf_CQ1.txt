Based on the provided context, it appears that various methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. 

In the context of biodiversity monitoring, a multisensor station is mentioned, which suggests that sensors are used to collect data (WÃ¤gele et al., 2022). 

In the context of age estimation of giant pandas, judging droppings in the wild is mentioned as a method for collecting data (Hu, 1987). 

In the context of fish detection and species classification in underwater environments, it is mentioned that deep learning is used with temporal information, which implies that data is collected from underwater environments, possibly using cameras or other sensors (Jalal et al., 2020). 

In the context of chimpanzee age estimation, DNA methylation is used, which suggests that biological samples are collected for analysis (Ito et al., 2018). 

No mention is made of surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that these methods are used in other contexts not mentioned in the provided context.
