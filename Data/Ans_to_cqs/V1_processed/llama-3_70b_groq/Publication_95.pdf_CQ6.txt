Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model are:

1. Data augmentation: The images were augmented during training using a three-step procedure, which includes:
   a. Randomly flipping the image horizontally.
   b. Scaling the contrast of each image channel by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2.
   c. Randomly cropping the image to a square with side lengths equal to the image height.

2. Balancing the training set: The training set was balanced by upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the number of images of the most represented class, "No species".

No mention of normalization, scaling, or cleaning is made in the provided context. Therefore, it is unknown whether these preprocessing steps were involved or not.
