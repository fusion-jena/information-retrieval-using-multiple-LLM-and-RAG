The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention that the model was partially trained to learn the data first and then used to annotate new data before training it further. This suggests that the model was used for self-annotation, where the model itself generated annotations for new data. Additionally, it is mentioned that the self-annotation dataset was manually checked and edited by a human. This implies that the annotations generated by the model were reviewed and corrected by a human annotator to ensure accuracy.
