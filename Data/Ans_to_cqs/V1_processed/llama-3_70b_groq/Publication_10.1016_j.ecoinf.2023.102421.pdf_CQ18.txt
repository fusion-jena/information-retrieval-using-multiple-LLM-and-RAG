The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is 10-fold cross-validation. This is mentioned in the context as "To eliminate bias, 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process, and mean RMSE was used as the objective function (lost function)". This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation, and the mean RMSE was used as the metric to monitor and optimize the model's performance.
