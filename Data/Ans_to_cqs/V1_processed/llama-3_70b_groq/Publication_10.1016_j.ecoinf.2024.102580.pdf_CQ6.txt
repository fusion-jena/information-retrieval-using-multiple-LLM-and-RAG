According to the provided context, before training a deep learning model, the following preprocessing steps are involved:

1. Resolution reduction: The resolution of the images in the ground-truth dataset was reduced to 1000 Ã— 1333.
2. Normalization: The three colour channels of the images were normalized by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviations per channel. The colour channel means and standard deviations were based on the ImageNet dataset used in the training of the (pre-trained) RestNet-50. The mean values were [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], and the standard deviations were [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].

No other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning are mentioned in the provided context.
