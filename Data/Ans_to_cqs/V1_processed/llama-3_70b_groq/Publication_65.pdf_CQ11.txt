I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning algorithms for semantic segmentation to detect trees in urban areas, the evaluation of different architectures, and the experimental setup. However, it does not provide information about where the dataset or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a specific repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
