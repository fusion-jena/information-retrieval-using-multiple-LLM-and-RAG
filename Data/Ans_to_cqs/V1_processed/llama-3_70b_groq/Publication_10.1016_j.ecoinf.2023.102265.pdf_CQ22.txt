The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "validation inaccuracies" and "validation accuracy" in the context of the SVM classifier model. It also mentions "test accuracy" separately. 

Based on this information, it can be inferred that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, it does not provide information about other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. 

Therefore, the answer is that accuracy is one of the metrics used, but the context does not provide information about other metrics.
