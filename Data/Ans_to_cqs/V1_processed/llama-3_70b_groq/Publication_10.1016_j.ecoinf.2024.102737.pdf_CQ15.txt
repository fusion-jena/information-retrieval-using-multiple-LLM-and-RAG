Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context focuses on the architecture and loss functions used in the Siamese network, as well as the comparison of different classification methods, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
