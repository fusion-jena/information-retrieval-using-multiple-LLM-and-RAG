I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context only mentions that an artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented, and that it was constructed empirically with two input nodes and one output node. It also mentions that 100 successful runs were performed to evaluate the model's performance, but it does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
