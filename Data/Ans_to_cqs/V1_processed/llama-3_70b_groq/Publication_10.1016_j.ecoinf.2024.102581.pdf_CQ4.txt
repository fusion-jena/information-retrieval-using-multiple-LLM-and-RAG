The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include random rotation, random cropping, random flipping, random color jittering, and random noise addition. These techniques were implemented using Kera's flow_from_directory method during the learning phase of the CNN to ensure that all possible cases that might occur in the real world are covered.
