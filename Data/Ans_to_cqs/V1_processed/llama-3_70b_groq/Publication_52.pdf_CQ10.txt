I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be an academic paper discussing the use of extreme deep learning in biosecurity, specifically for marine species identification, but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
