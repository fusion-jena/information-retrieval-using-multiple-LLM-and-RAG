Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different ResNet models for feature extraction and their training times. It also provides a visualization of the extracted features using a pre-trained ResNet-50 model, but it does not discuss the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
