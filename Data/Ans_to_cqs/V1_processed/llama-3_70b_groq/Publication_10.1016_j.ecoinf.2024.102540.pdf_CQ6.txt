Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text discusses the splitting ratio of the dataset, the characteristics of deep learning models, hyperparameters, and training aspects, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is mentioned in section 2.6 that applying different preprocessing and augmentation techniques can diversify the training data and increase overall performance. This suggests that preprocessing is an important step in the process, but the specific steps involved are not detailed in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this particular context.
