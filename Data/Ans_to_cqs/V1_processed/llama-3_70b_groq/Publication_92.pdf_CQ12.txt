The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the text, which mentions the use of convolutional layers, inception layers, and a soft-max classifier, all of which are components of a CNN architecture. Specifically, the architecture is based on GoogLeNet, which is a type of CNN. Additionally, the text explains the functionality of convolutional layers, activation functions, and pooling phases, which are all characteristic of CNNs. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
