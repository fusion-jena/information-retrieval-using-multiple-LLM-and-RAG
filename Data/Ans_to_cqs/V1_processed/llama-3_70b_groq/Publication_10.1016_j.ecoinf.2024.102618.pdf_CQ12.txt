Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks). The context mentions specific CNN architectures such as EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, InceptionResNetv2, and ResNet50v2, which are all variants of CNNs. These models are used for image classification tasks and are trained on large datasets like ImageNet. There is no mention of RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) or Transformers in the context, which are typically used for sequential data or natural language processing tasks.
