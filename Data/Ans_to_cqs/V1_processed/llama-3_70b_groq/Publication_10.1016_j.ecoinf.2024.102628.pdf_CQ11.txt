I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning for forest classification, the Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation approach, and the utilization of the fast.ai platform, but it does not provide information about the data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
