According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model (in this case, a CNN) include:

1. Augmentation: The images were augmented using rotations between 0 and 360 degrees, reflected by the vertical axis, and vertically shifted by +/- 5 pixels.
2. Standard image normalization: The 8-bit pixel values were mapped to floating-point values between 0 and 1.

No other preprocessing steps, such as scaling or cleaning, are mentioned in the provided context.
