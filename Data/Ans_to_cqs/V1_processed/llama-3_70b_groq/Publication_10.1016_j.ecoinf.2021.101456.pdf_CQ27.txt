Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model architecture, and performance evaluation of the dynamic Î²-VAE model. It discusses the implementation details, such as the use of PyTorch, Adam optimizer, and Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics processing unit, but does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
