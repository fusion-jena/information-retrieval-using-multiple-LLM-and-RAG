Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning models appears to be classification. The models are being used to recognize and classify bird species from images. The performance metrics used to evaluate the models, such as validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are typical metrics used in classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions "recognition of endemic bird species" and "classify bird species audio", which further supports the classification purpose. There is no indication of segmentation or detection tasks in the provided context.
