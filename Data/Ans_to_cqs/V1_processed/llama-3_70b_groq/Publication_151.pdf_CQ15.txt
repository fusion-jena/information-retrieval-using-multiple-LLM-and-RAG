The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model uses a "running average of its recent magnitude to speed up training" which is a technique used in some optimizers like RMSProp and Adam. But it is not explicitly stated which optimizer is used. Therefore, I don't know the exact optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
