I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of deep learning models for image classification, the selection of CNN algorithms, and the optimization of model parameters, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
