Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context primarily focuses on citing various research papers related to deep learning-based classification of hyperspectral data and remote sensing imagery. It also explains some techniques for evaluating the interpretability of deep learning models and provides a brief overview of the architecture of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. However, it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
