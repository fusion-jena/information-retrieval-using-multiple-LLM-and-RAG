I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily focuses on the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in LSTM neural networks, and it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
