The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically satellite images from SPOT6 with four raw channels: Red, Green, Blue, and Near Infra-Red. Additionally, six neo-channels (NDVI, MSAVI, MNDWI, L, c3, and ExG) are derived from these raw channels and used as input data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
