Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of various metrics. These metrics include AUC, Omission, TPR, Kappa, and TSS. The context also mentions that the best model is highlighted in bold where higher values are better for AUC, TPR, TSS, and Kappa, and lower values are better for Omission.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps. It is possible that these steps may have been performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

It is worth noting that the context does mention model evaluation, which involves testing the impact of potential biases and errors using five different treatments. These treatments include random backgrounds, spatial filtering input data, and others. However, the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training are limited to the calculation of the mentioned metrics.
