The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a deep learning model, specifically U2-Net and TrunkNet, for salient object detection tasks. It discusses the model's design, loss function, and dataset properties, but does not address randomness or random seed values.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
