I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be a research paper on improving deep learning-based bluespotted ribbontail ray recognition, and it discusses various aspects of the model, such as architecture, data augmentation, and feature extraction enhancement. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
