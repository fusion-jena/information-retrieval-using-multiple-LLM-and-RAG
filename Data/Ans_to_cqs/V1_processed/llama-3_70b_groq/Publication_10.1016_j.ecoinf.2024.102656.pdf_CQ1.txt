Based on the provided context, it appears that the data collection process involved two primary sources to ensure robustness. The first source was direct observation and documentation by the research team, which included on-the-ground observations and information provided by park rangers. This resulted in a subset of the dataset consisting of 100 occurrences of wild goat, 150 occurrences of urial, and 50 occurrences of jebeer gazelle.

The second source of data collection is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that the remaining portion of the dataset was collected. This portion consisted of 100 occurrences of wild goat, 60 occurrences of urial, and 140 occurrences of jebeer gazelle.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context suggests that the data was primarily collected through field observations and information gathered from park rangers.
