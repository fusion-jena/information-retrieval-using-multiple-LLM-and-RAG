The context provided does not mention a deep learning model. It mentions a random forest algorithm used in the LEAS module of the PLUS model to obtain development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of land use data. It also compares this approach to the FLUS model, which uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to determine development probabilities based on only one period of land use data. However, it does not specify the purpose of the ANN in the FLUS model. Therefore, I don't know the purpose of a deep learning model in this context, as it is not mentioned.
