The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the labeled images were divided into three subsets: "training," "validation," and "test." 

It can be inferred that the splitting of data is done randomly, as it is a common practice in machine learning to randomly split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The purpose of this split is to create a statistical model during the training phase, evaluate the model's performance on the validation set, and finally test the model on the test set.

However, the exact criteria or ratio used for splitting the data (e.g., 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing) are not specified in the provided context.
