I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses various techniques and architectures used in the model, such as VAE, UMAP, residual networks, and batch normalization, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
