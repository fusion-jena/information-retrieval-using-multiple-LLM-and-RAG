The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, is for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification. These models are used to recognize intricate patterns in satellite imagery and automatically extract hierarchical features at various scales, including edges, textures, and more intricate elements. This enables them to classify LULC effectively. Additionally, the deep learning models can facilitate the generation of real-time LULC information and adapt to evolving LULC patterns continuously, capturing temporal shifts and variations in land cover patterns.
