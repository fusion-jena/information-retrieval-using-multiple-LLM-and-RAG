Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context focuses on the methodology, infrastructure, and results of the training process, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for training. 

The table and figure provided do not give any hints about the validation loss plateau or any other criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
