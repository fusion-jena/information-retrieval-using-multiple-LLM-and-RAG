The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only describes the experimental equipment and environment used for training, which includes a laptop with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU, and a Windows 10 Enterprise operating system. It also mentions the software environment, including Python, CUDA, and PyTorch. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
