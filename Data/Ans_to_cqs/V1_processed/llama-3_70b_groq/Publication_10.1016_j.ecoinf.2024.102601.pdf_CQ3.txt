The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on optimizing data structures for machine learning classification, specifically selecting predictors from S2 imagery and integrating XAI techniques. It also discusses hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for a random forest algorithm. There is no mention of data annotation techniques, so I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
