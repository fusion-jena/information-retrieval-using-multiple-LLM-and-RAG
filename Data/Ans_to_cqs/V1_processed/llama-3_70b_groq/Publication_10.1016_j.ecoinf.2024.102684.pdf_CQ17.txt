The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors compared the training, validation, and testing performance to avoid overfitting, which implies that they took some measures to prevent overfitting. 

Unfortunately, the context does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used, such as dropout or L2 regularization. It only mentions the hyperparameter search involved a small grid search selecting the hidden activation function, optimizer, and learning rate. 

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
