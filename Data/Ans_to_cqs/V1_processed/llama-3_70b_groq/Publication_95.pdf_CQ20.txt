The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the processing platform and its ability to evaluate images with a resolution of 224 Ã— 224 pixels in real time using ResNet50-v2. It does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
