I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various models, datasets, and research papers, but it does not provide a link to a repository where the pipeline is stored. The context mentions TensorFlow Hub, which is a repository of pre-trained models, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the research. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
