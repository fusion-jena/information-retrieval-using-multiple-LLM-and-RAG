The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on wetland mapping and remote sensing data classification using deep learning models, particularly transformers and CNNs. It discusses the limitations of acquiring large amounts of training data and proposes a solution using the 3DUNetGSFormer model. The figures provided show wetland classification maps and extracted features of an urban object, but do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
