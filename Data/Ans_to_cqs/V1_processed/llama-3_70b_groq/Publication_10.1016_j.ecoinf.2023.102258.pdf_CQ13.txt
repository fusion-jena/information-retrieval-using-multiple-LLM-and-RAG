The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on explaining the prototypical network approach, query-time adaptation, and transductive few-shot learning, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
