The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text only mentions the learning rate adjustment strategy, which is the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. It does not provide information about the specific optimization algorithm used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
