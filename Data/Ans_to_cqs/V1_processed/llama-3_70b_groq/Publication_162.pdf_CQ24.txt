Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in fauna and flora recognition, and the authors' research interests in unsupervised machine learning, reinforcement learning, and fine-grained visual categorization.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of data augmentation to improve the recognition performance of the system. This involves obtaining additional images from internet image search engines to augment the training dataset. Although this is not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that the authors are aware of the importance of robustness in their model and are taking steps to improve it.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves techniques such as fixing random seed values, using dropout layers, and applying regularization techniques. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
