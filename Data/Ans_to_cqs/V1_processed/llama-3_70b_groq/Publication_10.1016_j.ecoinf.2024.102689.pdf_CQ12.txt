Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the mentions of CNNs in various papers and studies, such as Rauf et al. (2019) proposing a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species recognition, and Zhang et al. (2021) using an improved YoloV4 and FaceNet for underwater fish individual recognition.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of YoloV4, which is a type of CNN architecture, and FaceNet, which is a facial recognition model that can be adapted for fish recognition. There is no explicit mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.

However, it is important to note that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the entire pipeline, and it is possible that other deep learning models may be used in certain components of the pipeline.
