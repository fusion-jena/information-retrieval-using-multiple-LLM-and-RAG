PyTorch.

The context mentions that "We used a ResNet-34 model with pre-trained weights for the CNN architecture" and "We used an Adam optimiser algorithm with an exponential learning rate decay function, which is a common method of learning rate optimisation used for CNN training (Kingma and Ba, 2014). We then used a WeightedRandomSampler function in Pytorch." This indicates that PyTorch is the framework used to build the deep learning model. There is no mention of TensorFlow or any other framework.
