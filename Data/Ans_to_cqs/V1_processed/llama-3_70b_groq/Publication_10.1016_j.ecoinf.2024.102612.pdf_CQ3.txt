The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of synthetic data for training a deep learning model, data augmentation, and semantic segmentation using a DNN model. However, it does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
