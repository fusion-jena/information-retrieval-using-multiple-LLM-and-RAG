According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is based on the sticky plate level. Specifically, individual insects that belonged to the same sticky plate image were kept together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). This means that the data was split based on the image it came from, rather than randomly splitting the data. This approach allows the model to be validated in a practice-oriented way, by emulating how it will be used in real-world scenarios, where it will predict classes for objects detected on unseen sticky plate images.
