I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions MXNet as the open-source AI platform used for AI development, and GluonCV as the tool used to develop LaDeco, but it does not provide information about the cloud platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) was used to deploy the deep learning model.
