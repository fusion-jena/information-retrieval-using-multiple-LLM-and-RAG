Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses the annotation process, evaluation metrics, and model training hyperparameters, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training and testing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
