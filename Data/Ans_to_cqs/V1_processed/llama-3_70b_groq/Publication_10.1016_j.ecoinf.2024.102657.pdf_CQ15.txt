Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The text only discusses the structure of the CNN, the creation of the metadata file, and the training process, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to train the CNN. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
