I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the model training, preprocessing, and challenges in acoustic monitoring, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
