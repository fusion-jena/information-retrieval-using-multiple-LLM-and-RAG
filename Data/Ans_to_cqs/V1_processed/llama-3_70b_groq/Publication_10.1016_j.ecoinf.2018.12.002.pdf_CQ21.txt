I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to machine learning and movement ecology, but it does not provide specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
