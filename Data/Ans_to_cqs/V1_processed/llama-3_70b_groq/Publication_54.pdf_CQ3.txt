The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the experimental settings, model architecture, and transfer learning approach used for recognizing endemic bird species. It discusses data augmentation, model training, and validation, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
