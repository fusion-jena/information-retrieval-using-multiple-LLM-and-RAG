I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a study on land use changes, with sections on methodology and conclusion, and tables showing changes in forest area, grassland area, cropland area, and orchard area over different time periods. There is no mention of machine learning or model training, which is typically where postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrix would be relevant. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
