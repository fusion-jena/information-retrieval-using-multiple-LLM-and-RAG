I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the use of machine learning and cellular automata for forest fire simulation, but it does not provide information about the data repository used to store the data. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
