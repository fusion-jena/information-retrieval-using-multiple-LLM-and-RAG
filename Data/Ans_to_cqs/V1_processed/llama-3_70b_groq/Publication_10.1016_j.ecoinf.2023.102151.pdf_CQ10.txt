I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. It discusses a visualization system for soil information, its development using C# language within Microsoft's .NET Framework, and its integration into Rhino's plugin ecosystem. However, it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
