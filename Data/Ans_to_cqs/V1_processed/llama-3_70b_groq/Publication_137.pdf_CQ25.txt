The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is semantic segmentation. The model is designed to segment point clouds into different tree species. The pipeline of the framework involves computing geometric partition, converting each partition into a superpoint, and then segmenting the point clouds based on context with a graph convolution network. The final output of the model includes point cloud geometric partition graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results. The model is trained to classify the superpoint's embedding vector and its surroundings in the GCN, which is a common approach in semantic segmentation tasks.
