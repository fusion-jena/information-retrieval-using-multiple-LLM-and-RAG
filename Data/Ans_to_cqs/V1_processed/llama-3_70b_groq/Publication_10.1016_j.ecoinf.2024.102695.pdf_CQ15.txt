Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and mechanisms of the Transformer model, attention calculation, and signal decomposition, but it does not provide information about optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
