Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of synthetic data for reef modeling, coral cover, and zoning, as well as the application of classical and deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN). 

However, it does mention the use of a TVAE model from SDV, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder model, to develop the initial coral cover model. This model involves an encoder that maps the original data to distributions in a lower dimensional latent space, and a decoder that transforms the data back to the original space. The learning phase of the decoder involves finding a transformation with minimal loss between the original and final data distributions, quantified using the evidence lower bound (ELBO).

While this information provides insight into the deep learning methodology employed, it does not specifically address strategies for handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
