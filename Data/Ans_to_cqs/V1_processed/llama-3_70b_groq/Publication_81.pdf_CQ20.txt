I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the application of deep learning methods in biological networks, fish classification using DNA barcode sequences, and the use of Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in the ESK model. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs.
