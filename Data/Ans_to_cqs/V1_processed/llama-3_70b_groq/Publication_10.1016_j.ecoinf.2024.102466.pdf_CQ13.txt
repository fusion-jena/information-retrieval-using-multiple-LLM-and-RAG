I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or others. The text focuses on the performance of different object detection models (e.g., Cascade RCNN, FCOS, Faster RCNN) on bird recognition tasks using camera trap images, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
