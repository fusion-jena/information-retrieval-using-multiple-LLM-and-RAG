Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated detection of humpback whale songs, including the architecture, training, and inference procedures. It does not provide information on regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
