Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the preprocessing and training of the CNN and k-NN models, as well as the description of the training and test data. It does not provide information on how the raw bird song data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
