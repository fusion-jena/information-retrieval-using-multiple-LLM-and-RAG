The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically moth species classification. This is stated in section 2.2.3, "Moth Species Classification", where the authors discuss the challenge of finding a suitable CNN architecture for classifying moth species. The model is designed to classify moth species based on images, using a customized CNN architecture that is light and fast for execution on an embedded Raspberry Pi computer.
