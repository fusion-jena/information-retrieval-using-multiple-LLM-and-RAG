The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It focuses on the model training process, including the selection of the optimal number of training epochs and the evaluation of the model's performance using validation and test data sets.

However, based on the context, we can infer that the postprocessing steps might include the calculation of metrics such as the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), as it is mentioned as a performance measure for the selected models. Additionally, the context does not mention any other postprocessing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.

Therefore, the answer is that the context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, except for the calculation of metrics like AUC.
