Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in this study include surveys and incidental records from the public. There is no mention of sensors or public datasets being used for data collection. The text states that "some species records were sourced from surveys that recorded absence in addition to presence-only incidental records from the public." This suggests that surveys and public contributions were used to gather data, but it does not provide information on other methods that may be used in a deep learning pipeline.
