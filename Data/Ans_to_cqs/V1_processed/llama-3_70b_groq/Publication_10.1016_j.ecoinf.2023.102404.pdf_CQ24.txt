The context provided does not specifically mention deep learning, but it does discuss strategies to handle randomness in a machine learning pipeline. In this case, the strategy employed is the use of a random seed value, referred to as the 'seed' parameter. This parameter is used to ensure reproducibility in the model's results. 

To handle randomness, multiple seed values are evaluated, and the one that provides the most stable and reliable results is selected. This approach helps to minimize the impact of randomness on the model's performance and ensures that the results are consistent across different runs.

It's worth noting that the context does not mention other strategies that are commonly used to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout, batch normalization, or data augmentation. These strategies are typically used to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities.
