The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset and overcome the problem of overfitting. This implies that data augmentation was used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. There is no mention of dropout, L2 regularization, or any other regularization methods.
