Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models in agricultural and environmental remote sensing, and the interpretability of these models. It discusses various techniques for evaluating the interpretability of deep learning models, such as gradient-based sensitivity analysis, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and class activation maps.

The context also mentions the use of remote sensing data, including hyperspectral data, and references several studies that have applied deep learning models to remote sensing data. However, it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps used in these studies.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
