Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on image retrieval, performance metrics, and experimental results of various neural networks. It does not provide information about the training process or the stopping criteria used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
