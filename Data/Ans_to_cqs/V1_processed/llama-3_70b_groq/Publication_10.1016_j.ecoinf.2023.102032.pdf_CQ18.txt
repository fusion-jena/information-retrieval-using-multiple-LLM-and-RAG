I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a research article or study on wetland monitoring using earth observation data, specifically Sentinel-2, and machine learning. It provides information on the study area, data sources, and references to other research papers, but it does not discuss the training process or model performance monitoring strategy. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
