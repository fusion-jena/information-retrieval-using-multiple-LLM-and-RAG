Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for image classification, particularly in the context of wildlife surveys using camera traps. It discusses the use of the AlexNet model, local response normalization, and rectified linear unit activation functions, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
