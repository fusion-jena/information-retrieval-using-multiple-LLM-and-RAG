The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on classification models, data augmentation, and feature selection methods to improve classification accuracy. It does not discuss specific techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique to enhance the generalization capabilities of the model, which can indirectly help address data bias. Additionally, the context discusses refining the training samples and changing the proportion of the training and test data, which could be related to addressing data bias, but it does not provide explicit details on how to do so.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and it is unclear what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
