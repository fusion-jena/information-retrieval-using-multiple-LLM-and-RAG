The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and ecological niche analysis. The model validation methods mentioned are the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS), which are commonly used in SDM studies. 

There is no mention of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The validation of the model is done using multiple databases (Table 2), but this is not related to deep learning models. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
