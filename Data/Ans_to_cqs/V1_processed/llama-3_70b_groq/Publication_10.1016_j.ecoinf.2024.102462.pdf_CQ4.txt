Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that data augmentation is used to expand the dataset, balance the classes, and improve the overall accuracy of the models. It does not provide details on the specific techniques used, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
