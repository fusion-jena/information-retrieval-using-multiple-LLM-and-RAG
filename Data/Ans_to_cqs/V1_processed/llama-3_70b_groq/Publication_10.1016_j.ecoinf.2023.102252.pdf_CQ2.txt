I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. The context appears to be related to an article about a floodplain ecological response model, discussing environmental flows, riparian ecosystems, and biodiversity maintenance. There is no mention of deep learning, images, audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
