I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the model architecture, dataset, training procedure, and the species assemblage model, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
