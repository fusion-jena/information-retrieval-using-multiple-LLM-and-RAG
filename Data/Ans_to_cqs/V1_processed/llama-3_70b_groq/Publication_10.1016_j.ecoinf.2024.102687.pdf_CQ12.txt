The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Specifically, four CNN backbones are used: ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet. These models are used for feature extraction and are fine-tuned on the target dataset using meta-learning algorithms such as Matching Networks (MN), Prototypical Networks (PN), and Relation Networks (RN).
