Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using airborne imagery, specifically RGB imagery. The context does not mention surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. 

However, it does mention the use of LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithms to generate pretraining data by overlaying predicted trees onto RGB imagery. This suggests that LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors may be used to collect data, which is then used to generate pretraining data for the deep learning model.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide explicit information on how the RGB imagery is collected, but it can be inferred that it is collected through airborne remote sensing, possibly using sensors mounted on aircraft or UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles).
