The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the configuration and performance of LSTM models for air quality prediction, including the selection of the temporal window, comparison with other RNN architectures, and the use of dropout layers to avoid overfitting. It also mentions the preprocessing of the training set using a MinMaxScaler to scale features to a [0-1] range. However, it does not discuss data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
