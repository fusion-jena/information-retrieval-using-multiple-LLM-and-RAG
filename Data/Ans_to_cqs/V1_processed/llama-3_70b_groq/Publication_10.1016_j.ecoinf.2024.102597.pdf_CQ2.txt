Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various algorithms and techniques used for water quality prediction, including machine learning and deep learning, but it does not specify the data formats used. 

However, based on the mention of satellite imagery from VIIRS and Landsat satellites, it can be inferred that image data might be used in the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Python and Anaconda for model development, which suggests that CSV or other tabular data formats might be used. But this is only an inference, and the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated.
