The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in the text as "CNN represents an algorithm type or neural network model commonly used to process two or more dimensions of data with high complexity, such as images or sound data" and also referred to as "convolutional neural network deep learning model" in Table 3.
