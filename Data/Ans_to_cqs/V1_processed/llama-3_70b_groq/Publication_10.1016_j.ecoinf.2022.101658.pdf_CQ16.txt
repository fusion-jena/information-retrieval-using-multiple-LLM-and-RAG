Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to image classification, specifically in the context of forest fuel loading data, and discusses various performance metrics such as mIoU and accuracy. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
