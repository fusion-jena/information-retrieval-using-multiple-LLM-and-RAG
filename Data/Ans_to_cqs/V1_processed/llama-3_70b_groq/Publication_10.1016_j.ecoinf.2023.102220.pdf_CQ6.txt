Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the architecture of the deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, the activation functions used, and the implementation details in Python using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries. It also compares the performance of different machine learning methods, including the proposed PBP method, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
