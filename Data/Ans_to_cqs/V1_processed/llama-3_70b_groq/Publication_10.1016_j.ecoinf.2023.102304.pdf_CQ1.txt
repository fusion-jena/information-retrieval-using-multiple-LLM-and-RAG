The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data and satellite imagery, specifically from Landsat, which suggests that sensors and public datasets might be used for data collection. Additionally, the context mentions Google Earth Engine, which is a platform that provides access to a large repository of satellite and aerial imagery, as well as other Earth observation data. This implies that public datasets might be utilized for data collection. However, it does not provide information on whether surveys or other methods are used for data collection.
