I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only discusses the classification accuracies of three deep learning algorithms (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) and provides a brief overview of the architecture of GoogLeNet and ResNet. It also discusses the potential of deep learning methods for tree species diversity mapping, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the models.
