The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation as a technique to help generalise the model. Specifically, it mentions the use of the fastai get_transforms function with arguments such as "flip_vert = TRUE" to allow for vertical flipping of images, "max_lighting = 0.02" to limit overly exposing the images, and "max_zoom = 1" to disable the zooming augmentation. Additionally, it mentions the use of "to_fp16 = TRUE" to reduce the memory load on the graphical processing unit (GPU).

While data augmentation is a technique used to prevent overfitting, it is not a regularization method in the classical sense. The context does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
