Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is an image format. This is because the approach described in the text involves creating an image that represents the audio energy of a certain record in a time and frequency graph, and then using deep learning algorithms on these images for audio pattern identification. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV formats being used in the pipeline.
