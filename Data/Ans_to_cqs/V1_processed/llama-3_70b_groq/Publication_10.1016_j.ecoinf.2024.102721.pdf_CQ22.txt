Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context focuses on explaining the LSTM model, its structure, and its application in forecasting ecological water demand, as well as scenario analysis and model interpretability. It does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
