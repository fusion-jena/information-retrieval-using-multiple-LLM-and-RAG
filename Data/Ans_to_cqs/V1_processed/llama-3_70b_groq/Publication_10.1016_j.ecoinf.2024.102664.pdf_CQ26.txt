Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for algal bloom forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. It discusses the performance evaluation of different models, the importance of integrating numerical model data into deep learning models, and the need for further refinement and optimization of the models. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
