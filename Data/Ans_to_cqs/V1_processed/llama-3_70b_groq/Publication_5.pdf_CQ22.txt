Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Bias, and Correlation. These metrics are compared with those of a random forest model in Table 1. Additionally, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the performance metric in the statistical feature importance test (SFIT) to determine the importance of input variables. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context.
