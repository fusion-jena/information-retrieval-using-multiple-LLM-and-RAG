I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be discussing a methodology for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, and it mentions various data sources and systems such as SPARQL, GRSF, D4Science, and others. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
