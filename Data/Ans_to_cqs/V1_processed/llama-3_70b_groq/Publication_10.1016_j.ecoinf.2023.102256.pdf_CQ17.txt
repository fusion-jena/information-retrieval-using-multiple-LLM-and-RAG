Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture of a simple CNN, the use of the Adam optimizer, and the training process, but it does not mention specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
