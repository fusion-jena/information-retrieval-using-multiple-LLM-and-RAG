Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of semi-supervised learning techniques, few-shot learning, and active learning in bioacoustic applications. It discusses the use of pre-trained feature extraction models, prototypical learning, and transfer learning, but it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the raw data might be collected from field recordings, as mentioned in Figure 2, which shows raw field data being segmented into 5-s spectrograms. This suggests that the raw data might be collected using audio recorders or sensors in the field, but the exact method is not specified.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, but it can be inferred that field recordings might be involved.
