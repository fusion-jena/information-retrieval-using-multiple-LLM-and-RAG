Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in biodiversity monitoring, data analysis, and auditing, but it does not delve into the specifics of data splitting for model training.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
