Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on various machine learning algorithms, their parameters, and performance evaluation metrics. It discusses the importance of hyperparameter tuning, model comparison, and variable importance in XGBoost, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
