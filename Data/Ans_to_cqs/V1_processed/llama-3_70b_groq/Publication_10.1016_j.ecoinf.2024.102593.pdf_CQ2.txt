The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio, specifically mel spectrograms. This is evident from the text, which mentions that the input to the model is 3-s sound frames converted into mel spectrograms using a fast Fourier transform window size of 1024, hop length of 896, and 128 mel filterbanks. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
