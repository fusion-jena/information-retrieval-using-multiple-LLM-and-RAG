The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the challenges of annotation discrepancies, inter-annotator variability, and methods to aggregate annotation sets for deep learning models.

However, it can be inferred that the annotation task involves labeling cetacean vocalizations in audio datasets, possibly using spectrograms to represent the audio data. The context mentions the importance of temporal context in annotating underwater sound events, suggesting that annotators may be labeling specific time segments or events in the audio data.

It is not clear what specific annotation techniques are used, such as whether annotators are drawing bounding boxes around specific vocalization events or segmenting individual vocalizations from the audio data. Further information would be needed to determine the exact annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
