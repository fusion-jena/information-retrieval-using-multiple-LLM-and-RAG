Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for classifying blue whale vocalizations and noise signals, and it does not mention deep learning models or preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
