The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "Details on the hyperparameters used for model fitting are provided in Supplementary material 1: Text S2." This suggests that the hyperparameter values used for model fitting are provided in a supplementary material, but the method of optimization is not specified. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
