I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing ensemble methods, specifically bagging and boosting, and their application to ecological informatics. It mentions XGBoost, a scalable tree boosting system, but does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
