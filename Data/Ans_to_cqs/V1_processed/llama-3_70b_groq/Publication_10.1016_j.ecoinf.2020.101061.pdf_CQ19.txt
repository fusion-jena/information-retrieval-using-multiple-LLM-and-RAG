I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the approach used for training the model, including the use of a Tesla K80 GPU, data augmentation, and pretraining on ImageNet, but it does not specify the framework used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
