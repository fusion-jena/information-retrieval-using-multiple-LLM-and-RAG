I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to machine learning and movement ecology, discussing topics like supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, hidden Markov models, and state space models. However, it does not provide information about data annotation techniques specifically used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
