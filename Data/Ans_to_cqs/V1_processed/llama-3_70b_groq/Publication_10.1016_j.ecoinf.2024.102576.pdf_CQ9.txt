I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the research methodology, references previous studies, and explains the advantages of using deep learning algorithms for land monitoring. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) where the deep learning pipeline data is available.
