Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, the methodology used, and the integration of contextual information into the deep learning classifier. It does not discuss the handling of randomness or the use of random seed values. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
