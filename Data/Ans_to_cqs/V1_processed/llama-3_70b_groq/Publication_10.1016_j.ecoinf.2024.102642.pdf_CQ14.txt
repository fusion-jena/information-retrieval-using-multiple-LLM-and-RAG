The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only states that the hyperparameters were maintained consistently across all training instances for each task, and the specific values used for batch sizes, learning rates, and number of epochs are provided. However, it does not explain how these values were chosen or optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
