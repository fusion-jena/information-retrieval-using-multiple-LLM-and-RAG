Based on the provided context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using various evaluation matrices such as precision, recall, and average precision (AP) at various Intersections Over Union (IoU) thresholds. The evaluation metrics for each model on the validation set were calculated after 300 epochs. This suggests that the model performance is monitored and evaluated at regular intervals (every 300 epochs) during training using these evaluation metrics.
