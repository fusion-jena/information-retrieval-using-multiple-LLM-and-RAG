The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework is used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the SILIC framework, which is used for training data, but it does not specify the framework used for building the deep learning model. The context cites several research papers related to bird sound classification and automatic bird song segmentation, but it does not provide information about the specific framework used for building the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
