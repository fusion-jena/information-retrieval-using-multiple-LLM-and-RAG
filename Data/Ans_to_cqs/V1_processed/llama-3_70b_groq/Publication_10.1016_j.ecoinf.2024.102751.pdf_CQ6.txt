Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on a study related to estimating soil moisture and vegetation water content using remote sensing data and topographic indices. It discusses the development of a spatial modeling approach using a generalized additive model (GAM) and mentions the potential of using machine learning or deep neural networks in the future. However, it does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps required for training a deep learning model.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature engineering, and data augmentation, depending on the specific problem and dataset. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact preprocessing steps required for a particular deep learning model.
