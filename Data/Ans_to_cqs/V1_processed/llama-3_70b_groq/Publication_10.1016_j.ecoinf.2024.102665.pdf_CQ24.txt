Based on the provided context, I don't see any information related to deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be focused on coral reefs, marine biology, and statistical analysis, with no mention of deep learning or random seed values.

The only mention of a deep learning model is in the paper by Do and Tran (2023), but it does not provide information on handling randomness in the pipeline. The other papers and text snippets do not mention deep learning at all.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
