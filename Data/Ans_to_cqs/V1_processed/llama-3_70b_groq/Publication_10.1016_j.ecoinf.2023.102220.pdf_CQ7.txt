The context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the authors selected 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% of the initial observations of the time series for training and the complement as test sets to obtain the accuracy, true-positive rates, and false-positive rates. This suggests that the data was split into training and test sets, but the context does not provide information about a validation set or the specific criteria used for splitting the data.
