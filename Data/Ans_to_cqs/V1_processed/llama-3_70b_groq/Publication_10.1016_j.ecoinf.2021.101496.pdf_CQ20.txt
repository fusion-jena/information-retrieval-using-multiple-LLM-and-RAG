I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or the hardware resources used for training such models. The context appears to be focused on the technical specifications of the Raspberry Pi 3B+ single-board computer and its use in a prototype called Rasp2SPAD, as well as statistical models (simple linear model and generalized linear model) used for predicting SPAD values. There is no mention of deep learning models or the hardware resources required for training them.
