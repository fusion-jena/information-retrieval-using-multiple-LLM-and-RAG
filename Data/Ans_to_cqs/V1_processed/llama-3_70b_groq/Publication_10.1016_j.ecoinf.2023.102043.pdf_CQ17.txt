I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the audio data processing, YAMNet model, and its application to goat vocalization detection. It does not provide information about the specific regularization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
