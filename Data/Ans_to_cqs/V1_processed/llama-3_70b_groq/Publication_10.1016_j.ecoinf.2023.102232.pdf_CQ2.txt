The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline, nor does it specify the data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to a hybrid MCMC algorithm and a genetic algorithm for parameter estimation, with data stored in text files and Python dictionaries. There is no mention of image, audio, video, or CSV data formats. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
