I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the nasawebservice Python package, its functionality, and its dependencies, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context mentions NASA web services, MongoDB, and other databases, but it does not mention Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, which are data repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
