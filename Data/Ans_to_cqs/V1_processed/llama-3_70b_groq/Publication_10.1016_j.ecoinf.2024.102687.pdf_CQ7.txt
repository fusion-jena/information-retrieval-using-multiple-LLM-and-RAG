Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the data acquisition process, the characteristics of the dataset, and the potential benefits of using features extracted from models trained on smaller but more specific datasets. It also discusses the challenges of training robust supervised classification models due to the lack of large labeled datasets.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Typically, the data is split into 60-80% for training, 15-20% for validation, and 5-10% for testing. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this specific case.

In summary, the context does not provide the necessary information to answer this question, and I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
