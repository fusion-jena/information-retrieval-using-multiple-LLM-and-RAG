I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The texts appear to be related to audio signal processing, ecological monitoring, and acoustic indices, but they do not discuss machine learning models or optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
