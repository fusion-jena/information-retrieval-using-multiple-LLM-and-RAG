The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the network training was stopped after 70 epochs, which suggests that the training was stopped after a complete scope of the dataset where each image is used only once. This implies that the training was stopped based on the number of epochs, rather than a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau.
