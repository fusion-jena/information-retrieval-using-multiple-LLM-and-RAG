I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context discusses a research on fish freshness classification using machine learning experiments with clustering, but it does not provide information about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
