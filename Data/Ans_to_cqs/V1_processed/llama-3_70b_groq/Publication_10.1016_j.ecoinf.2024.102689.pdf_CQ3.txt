Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Specifically, it is mentioned that "annotation typically focuses solely on the recognition and marking of bounding boxes" for standalone object detection. However, in the context of this research, instance segmentation is also used, which requires the inclusion of mask annotations that precisely align with the segmented contours during dataset preparation.
