The provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for classification tasks, particularly in the context of bird species identification. It discusses the use of embeddings, dimensionality reduction techniques, and active learning to improve model performance and facilitate the labor-intensive process of data generation. 

However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
