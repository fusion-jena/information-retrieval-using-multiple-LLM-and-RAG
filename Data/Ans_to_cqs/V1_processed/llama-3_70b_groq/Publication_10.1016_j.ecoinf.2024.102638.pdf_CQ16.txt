Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the process of dividing the dataset into training and test sets, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and evaluating the performance metrics of different regression models. 

However, it does mention that the negative mean square error is set as the target measure during the hyperparameter optimization process. This suggests that the models are optimized to minimize the mean square error, but it does not provide information on when to stop the training process.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
