The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of two datasets: the SSLs' dataset and the elephants' dataset. The elephants' dataset is referred to as the "aerial elephant dataset" and is mentioned as a public benchmark for aerial object detection. It is available on Zenodo, a digital repository for research data.

It can be inferred that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through aerial images, possibly taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, as mentioned in reference 16. However, the exact method of data collection is not specified.

In general, deep learning pipelines can utilize various methods for collecting raw data, including surveys, sensors, public datasets, and more. But in the context of this specific research, the exact method is not explicitly stated.
