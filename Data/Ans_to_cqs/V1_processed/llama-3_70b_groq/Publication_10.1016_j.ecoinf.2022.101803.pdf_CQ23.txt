The context does not mention a deep learning model. It appears to be discussing ensemble methods, specifically bagging and boosting, with a focus on XGBoost. To ensure the generalizability of the XGBoost model, a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme was used. The dataset was split into three subsets: a tuning set (k-2 folds), a validation set (1-fold), and a test set (1-fold). The model was trained on the tuning set, and its performance was monitored on the validation set by calculating the out-of-sample prediction accuracy. This process was repeated for each fold, and the median of k-1 folds was taken. This approach helps to avoid over-fitting and ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data.
