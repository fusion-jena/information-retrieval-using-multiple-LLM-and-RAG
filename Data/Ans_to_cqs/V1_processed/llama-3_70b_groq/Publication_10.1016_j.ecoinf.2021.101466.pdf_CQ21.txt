Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques used during dataset preprocessing for training an image detection and classification model. It discusses various methods such as cropping, flipping, scaling, rotating, adding noise, and color transformation, but it does not provide information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
