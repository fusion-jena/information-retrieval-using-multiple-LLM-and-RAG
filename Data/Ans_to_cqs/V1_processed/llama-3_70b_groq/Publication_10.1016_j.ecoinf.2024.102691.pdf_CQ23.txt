Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training parameters, and attention mechanisms used in the YOLOv5 model. It discusses the input image size, batch size, optimizer, and learning rate used during training, as well as the depth-attention mechanism and its placement in the network. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used, data preprocessing, or evaluation methods that could ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
