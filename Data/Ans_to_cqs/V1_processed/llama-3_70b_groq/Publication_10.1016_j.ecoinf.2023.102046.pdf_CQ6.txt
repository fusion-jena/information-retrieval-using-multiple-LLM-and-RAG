The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the Inception-V3 model accepts images resized to (299, 299) pixels, while ViT and ResNet resize to (224, 224) pixels. This suggests that image resizing is one of the preprocessing steps involved.

Additionally, the context does not mention other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. It is possible that these steps were performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only preprocessing step that can be confirmed is image resizing. Other preprocessing steps may have been performed, but they are not mentioned.
