The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that underwater videos are used as a source of data. The text mentions "training a deep learning model on large datasets of fish images" and "using underwater videos, it is possible to detect the fish present and estimate their size, which can then be used to calculate the total biomass." This suggests that the raw data is collected through underwater videos, which are then used to extract images of fish for training the deep learning model. 

It is not clear if surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data. The context does not provide information on these specific methods.
