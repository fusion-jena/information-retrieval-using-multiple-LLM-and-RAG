Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the training and validation of the model using the fast.ai platform and the Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation approach, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
