Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance metrics used to evaluate the models, the different deep learning models employed, and their corresponding accuracy and F1-scores. It also mentions the use of an image enhancement technique to improve the accuracy of the models. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used, such as whether it is diverse or if cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
