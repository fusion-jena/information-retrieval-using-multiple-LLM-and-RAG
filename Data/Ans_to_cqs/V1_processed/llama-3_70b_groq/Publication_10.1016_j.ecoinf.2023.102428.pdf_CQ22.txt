Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Training RMS (Root Mean Squared)
2. Testing RMS (Root Mean Squared)
3. Accuracy Rate (%)
4. Skill measure (%)

These metrics are mentioned in Table 7, which presents the MLP parameters and performance. The Training RMS and Testing RMS are used to evaluate the model's performance during training and testing, respectively. The Accuracy Rate and Skill measure are used to assess the model's overall performance.

Additionally, in the context of LULC classification and accuracy assessment (Table 2), the following metrics are used:

1. Producer's Accuracy (PA)
2. User's Accuracy (UA)
3. Overall Accuracy (%)
4. Overall Kappa Statistics

These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the LULC maps produced.
