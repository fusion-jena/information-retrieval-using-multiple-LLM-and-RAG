I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the architecture of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, including the number of neurons in each layer and the activation functions used. It also mentions the implementation of the classification methods in Python using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries. However, there is no mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
