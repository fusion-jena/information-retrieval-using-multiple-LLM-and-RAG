The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the architecture of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the configuration of the Random Forest (RF) model. 

For the MLP, the context mentions the number of neurons in the hidden layer, which is determined by the Fletcher-Gloss method, and the activation functions tested. However, it does not provide information about the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters.

For the RF model, the context mentions the number of random regression trees (ntree), the number of division variables (mtry), and the minimum size of nodes (node size) as the essential parameters configured during training. Again, there is no mention of learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters typically associated with deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
