The provided context does not mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of random forests for predicting relative tsetse abundance in Kenya, and it discusses two feature elimination techniques, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF), to prevent overfitting and improve model performance. There is no mention of deep learning or handling randomness in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
