The provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a different type of model, possibly a forest fire danger prediction model, and does not mention deep learning at all. It discusses the combination of factors, weighting approaches, and spatial resolution of data layers, but does not provide information on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
