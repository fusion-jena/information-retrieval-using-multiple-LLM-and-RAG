Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of different deep learning models for bird object detection using a dataset of images from camera traps. It discusses the results, conclusions, and potential applications of the study but does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
