The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the parameters of a Random Forest (RF) model, including the number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max_features). It also mentions that a grid search method (GridSearchCV) was used to search for the optimal parameters of the RF model. There is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
