Based on the provided context, it appears that a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. This is mentioned in the reference "Babaee, M., Dinh, D. T., & Rigoll, G. (2017). A deep convolutional neural network for background subtraction. Pattern Recognition, 76, 635â€“649." Additionally, the text mentions "feature extraction of the fixed inception layers", which suggests that a CNN architecture, specifically the Inception model, is being used.
