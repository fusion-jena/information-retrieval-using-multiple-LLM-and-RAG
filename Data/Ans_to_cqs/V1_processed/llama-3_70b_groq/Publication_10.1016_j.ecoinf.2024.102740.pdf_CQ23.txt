The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of a Random Forest (RF) technique for classification. 

To ensure the generalizability of the RF model, the authors used an "out-of-bag" (OOB) sample approach, which is an internal estimate of the generalization error. This approach uses samples that are not included in the training subset to validate the model. 

Additionally, the authors performed hyperparameter tuning for the RF model by testing different values for the maximum tree depth and minimum sample number. They found that the most accurate results were obtained when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure the generalizability of the model.
