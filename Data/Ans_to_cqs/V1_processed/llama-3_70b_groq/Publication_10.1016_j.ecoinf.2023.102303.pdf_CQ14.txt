The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that XGBoost is an efficient and distributed gradient boosting algorithm with rapidly optimized hyper-parameters, but it does not provide details on the optimization method used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
