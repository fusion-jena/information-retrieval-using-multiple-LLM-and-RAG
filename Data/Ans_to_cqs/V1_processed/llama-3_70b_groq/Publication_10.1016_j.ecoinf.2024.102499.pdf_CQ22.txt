The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F-measure. These metrics are computed for each model and are used to compare the performance of the models trained on different datasets (3 common shark species vs 27 species). The formulas for these metrics are also provided, which are: Precisioni = Tpi / (Tpi + Fpi), Recalli = Tpi / (Tpi + Fni), and Fmeasurei = 2 * (Recalli * Precisioni) / (Recalli + Precisioni), where Tpi is the number of true positives, Fpi is the number of false positives, and Fni is the number of false negatives for species i.
