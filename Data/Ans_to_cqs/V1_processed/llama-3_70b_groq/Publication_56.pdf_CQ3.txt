Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on citing various research papers and articles related to remote sensing, machine learning, and deep learning. It discusses topics such as semantic segmentation, land cover classification, and vegetation health prediction, but it does not provide information on specific data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query. If you need information on data annotation techniques, I suggest consulting relevant resources or research papers that specifically focus on data annotation methods for deep learning pipelines.
