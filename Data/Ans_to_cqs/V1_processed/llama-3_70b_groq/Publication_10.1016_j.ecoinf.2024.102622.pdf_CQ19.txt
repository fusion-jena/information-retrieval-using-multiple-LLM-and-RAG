I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The papers cited are related to remote sensing, vegetation extraction, and crop type classification, but they do not provide information about the frameworks used to implement the models. The figures and sections mentioned in the context are related to the results and methodology of the studies, but they do not provide information about the frameworks used. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning model.
