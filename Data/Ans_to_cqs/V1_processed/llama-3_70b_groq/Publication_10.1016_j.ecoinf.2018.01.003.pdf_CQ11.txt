I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the application of neural networks and deep learning in ecological informatics, but it does not provide a link to a specific data repository. The context mentions figures and tables, but it does not provide a link to a repository where the data or pipeline can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
