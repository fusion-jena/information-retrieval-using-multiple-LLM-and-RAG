I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing the methodology and results of a study on coral reef species identification using deep learning. The text provides details on the architecture of the neural network, the training process, and the performance of the model, but it does not mention where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
