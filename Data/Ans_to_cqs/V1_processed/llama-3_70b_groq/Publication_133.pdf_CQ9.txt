I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) as a source of ecological data, but it does not indicate that the pipeline's data repository is hosted on GBIF. The context also cites various research articles and publications, but it does not provide information about the pipeline's data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository where the pipeline's data is available.
