Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a study on Amur tigers, discussing data collection, trail formation, and classification models, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
