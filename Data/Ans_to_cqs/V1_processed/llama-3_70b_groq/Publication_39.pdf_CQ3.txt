According to the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are polygonal segmentation masks, bounding box annotation, and class labels. This is mentioned in Section 2.1, where it is stated that for each occurring animal in a frame of the training set, a polygonal segmentation mask depicting the visible silhouette, a bounding box, and a class label are annotated using the VGG Image Annotator (VIA) Version 2.0.8.
