Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, field measurements, and data collection process, but it does not provide details about the deep learning model's architecture or hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
