The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model's performance was evaluated using three error statistics: R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE. Additionally, the context mentions that the model's hyperparameters, such as "mtry" and "ntree", were tuned to minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). 

It can be inferred that the training process might have been stopped when the RMSE reached a minimum or plateaued, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified in the provided context.
