I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the experimental results and comparisons between different models, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It does not mention grid search, random search, or any other method used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
