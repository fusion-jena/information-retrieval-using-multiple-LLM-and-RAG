Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to image classification, land use management, and water retention measures, but it does not provide information on data bias handling techniques.

The context mentions resampling imagery data to harmonize band data and ensure consistent resolution, but it does not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques for deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
