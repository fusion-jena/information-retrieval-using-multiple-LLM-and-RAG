Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model. The text discusses the analysis of observational complex networks, specifically in the context of urban acoustic ecology, and mentions the use of machine learning approaches for sound event classification. However, it does not specify the purpose of a deep learning model.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the machine learning approaches are used for sound event classification, but the specific purpose of a deep learning model is not mentioned. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
