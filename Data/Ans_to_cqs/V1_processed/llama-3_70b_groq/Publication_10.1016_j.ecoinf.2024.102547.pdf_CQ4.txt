The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on functional data analysis, spatial-functional data analysis, and fisheries acoustics techniques, with no mention of deep learning or data augmentation.

The context discusses techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), dimension reduction, and empirical covariance functions, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
