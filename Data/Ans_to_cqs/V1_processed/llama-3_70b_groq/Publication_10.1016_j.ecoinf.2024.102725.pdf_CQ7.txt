I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to NDVI reconstruction and remote sensing, but it does not provide information on data splitting for deep learning model training. The context discusses various topics such as applying deep-learning enhanced fusion methods, selecting optimal NDVI time-series reconstruction techniques, and reconstructing global MODIS NDVI time series, but it does not mention data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
