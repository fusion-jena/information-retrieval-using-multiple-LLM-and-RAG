Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different classification networks, such as CNN, ViT, ResNet50, and CA-Hybrid, on a dataset of microorganisms. It discusses the improvement in classification accuracy achieved by incorporating CAM into the residual network and the positive correlation between image size and classification performance. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques, including those used to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
