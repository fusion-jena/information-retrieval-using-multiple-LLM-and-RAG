The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the description of the AutoML procedure, it can be inferred that the data is split into multiple partitions, including:

* A small subset of the data (At) used for training each candidate model during a small number of epochs.
* A left-out validation data set (Av) used to compare the performance of the candidate models.
* The full training data (Bt) used to train the selected model.
* A 'final' test data set (T) used to evaluate the performance of the selected model.

It is not clear what specific criteria are used to split the data into these partitions, such as the proportion of data allocated to each partition or the method used to select the data points for each partition.
