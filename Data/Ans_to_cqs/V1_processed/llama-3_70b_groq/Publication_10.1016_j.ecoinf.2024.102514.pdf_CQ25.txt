The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated as a classification, segmentation, or detection task. However, based on the context, it appears that the model is being used for regression tasks, specifically for waste disposal rate estimation and predicting heavy metals in soil and pollution indices in mining areas. The model is also used for assessing water quality in an ecologically critical urban canal. The evaluation metrics used, such as R2, NSE, MEF, Z, RMSE, and MAE, are commonly used for regression tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is to make predictions or estimates of continuous values.
