The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context only mentions that the framework relies on the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model, but it does not specify the type of model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
