The provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context focuses on data preprocessing, creating a training database, and a brief introduction to deep learning and neural networks. It does not provide information on what happens after the model is trained, such as calculating metrics, creating confusion matrices, or generating saliency maps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
