Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or batch size. The context only mentions the number of stacked LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and the dropout rate of 50% during training. It does not provide information about other hyperparameters that are typically used in deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
