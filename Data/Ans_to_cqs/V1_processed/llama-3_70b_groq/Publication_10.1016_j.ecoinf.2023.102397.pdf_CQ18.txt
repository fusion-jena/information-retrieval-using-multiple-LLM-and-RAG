Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the analysis of the target set, the comparison of software programs, and the importance of high evaluation metrics for reliable biological interpretations. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
