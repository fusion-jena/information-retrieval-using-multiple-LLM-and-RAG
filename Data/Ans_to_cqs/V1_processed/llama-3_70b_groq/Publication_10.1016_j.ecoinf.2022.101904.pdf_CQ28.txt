I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and 3DUNetGSFormer, and their performance in wetland classification tasks. It also discusses the advantages of transformers in computer vision and remote sensing applications. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used for these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
