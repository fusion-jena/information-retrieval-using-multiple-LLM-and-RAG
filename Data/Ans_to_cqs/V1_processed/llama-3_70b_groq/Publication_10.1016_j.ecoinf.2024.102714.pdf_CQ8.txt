I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper or report discussing habitat classification, accuracy assessments, and references to various studies and tools. There is no mention of a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline, so I cannot provide an answer to this query.
