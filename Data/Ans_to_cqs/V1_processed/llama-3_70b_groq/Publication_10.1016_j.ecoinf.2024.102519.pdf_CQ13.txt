I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses various machine learning and optimization techniques, including genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and support vector machines (SVM), but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
