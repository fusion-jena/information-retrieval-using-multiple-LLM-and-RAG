Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics for classifying bird species from flight calls using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and data augmentation.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming the input data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve the model's convergence and performance.
* Cleaning: handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting errors in the data.

Since the context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps used in this particular study, it is unclear whether these steps were performed or not.
