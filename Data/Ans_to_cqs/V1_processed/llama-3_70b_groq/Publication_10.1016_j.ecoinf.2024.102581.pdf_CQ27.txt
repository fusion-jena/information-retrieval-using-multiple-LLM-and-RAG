I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters of the CNN model, the search space for these hyperparameters, and the performance of different models on various classification tasks. It also provides some references to other research papers, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
