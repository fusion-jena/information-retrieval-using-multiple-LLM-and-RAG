The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data were split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set, with four of the five areas used for learning and validation, and the last isolated scene used as the test set. This suggests that the split was done based on the geographical areas, with the test set being a separate and independent area from the training and validation sets. The exact criteria or ratio used for the split are not provided.
