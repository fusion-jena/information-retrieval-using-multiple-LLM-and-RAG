The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the advances in data acquisition, storage, battery power, and processing techniques that have resulted in a widespread adoption of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) globally, recording the oceans' soundscape over larger temporal and spatial scales. However, it does not specify the methods used to collect the raw data.

It can be inferred that PAM involves the use of sensors to record the oceans' soundscape, but the context does not provide further details on the specific methods used for data collection. Additionally, there is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
