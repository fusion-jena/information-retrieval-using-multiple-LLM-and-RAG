The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only describes the architecture of the models, such as VGG style network and SubSpectralNet, and the training parameters, like Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. However, it does not mention TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
