The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation dataset. The validation dataset is an independent set of samples that is used to compute the accuracy and loss (estimation of the error during training) of the model. This validation dataset is used to assess the learning progress of the neural network. As the network never trains on or sees the validation data, this validation dataset can indicate if the model is overfitting the training data and not learning features that are key for recognizing the different classes (in this case, different individuals).
