Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The workflow described in the context only mentions "pre-processing of images" as a step, but it does not provide details on what specific preprocessing steps are involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
