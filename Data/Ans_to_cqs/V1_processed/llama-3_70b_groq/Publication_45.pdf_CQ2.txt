The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "bark beetle outbreaks in conifer-dominated forests" as an example of ecological prediction, it can be inferred that the data might be related to environmental or ecological data, such as sensor readings, remote sensing data, or other types of data relevant to forest ecology. The context also mentions "code and data" being provided, but it does not specify the format of the data. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline from the provided context.
