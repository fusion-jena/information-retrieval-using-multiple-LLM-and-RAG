Based on the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is instance segmentation. Specifically, the annotation of images involves manual labeling of data by assigning keywords/labels to required areas in the image to assign metadata. The borders of objects were outlined to associate every single pixel of objects in an entire image with a particular tag/label. This is an instance of instance segmentation, where each object in the image is annotated with a specific label.

Additionally, the context mentions that the annotation data was converted into COCO 1.0 dataset format, which includes information such as object id, image id, category id, segmentation, area, bbox, attributes, etc. This suggests that bounding box annotation is also involved in the pipeline, as bbox (bounding box) is one of the attributes mentioned.

However, it is not clear if other annotation techniques, such as semantic segmentation or keypoint annotation, are used in the pipeline. The context primarily focuses on instance segmentation and bounding box annotation.
