Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training process, including the selection of background training images, image manipulations, and augmentations. It explains how the network is trained iteratively on small mini-batches of images, computes loss scores, and updates its internal parameters. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
