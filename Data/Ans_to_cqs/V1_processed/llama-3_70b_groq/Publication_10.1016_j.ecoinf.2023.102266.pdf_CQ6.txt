Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a research paper on ecological informatics, discussing modifications to a model, optimizing scope, and strategies for variance reduction. It does not provide information on deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
