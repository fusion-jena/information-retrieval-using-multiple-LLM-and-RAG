I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of deep learning in ecology, provides references to various studies and papers, and mentions the R package "ranger" used for training productivity models, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
