The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification. The context mentions various classification schemes and models, such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and K-Nearest Neighbors, which are used for classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a hierarchical classification and optimal feature selection framework for coastal wetlands mapping, which further supports the classification purpose.

Furthermore, the context does not mention any segmentation or detection tasks, which are common purposes of deep learning models in computer vision. The focus is on classification, feature selection, and fusion of data from different sources, such as SAR imagery, multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data, to improve the accuracy of classification models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is classification.
