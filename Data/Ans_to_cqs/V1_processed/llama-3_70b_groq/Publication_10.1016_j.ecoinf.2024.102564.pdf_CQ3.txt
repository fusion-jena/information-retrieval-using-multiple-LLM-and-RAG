I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on estimating net growth in Atlantic Forest fragments using machine learning methods, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF). It discusses the objectives, materials, and methods of the study, but does not mention data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
