The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a five-fold cross-validation strategy was used to evaluate the approach and the baseline on the test dataset. This suggests that cross-validation was used to assess the model's performance, but it does not provide information on how the model's performance was monitored during the training process.
