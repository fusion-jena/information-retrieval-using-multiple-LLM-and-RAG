The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, for predicting Above-Ground Biomass (AGB). It highlights the importance of selecting pertinent variables, evaluating model performance, and tuning hyperparameters to avoid overfitting. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of training datasets. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what data augmentation techniques were applied in this specific pipeline.
