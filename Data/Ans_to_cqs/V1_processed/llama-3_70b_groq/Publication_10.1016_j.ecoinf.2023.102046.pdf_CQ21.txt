I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training process, model performance, and comparison with other models. It discusses the classification accuracy, learning curves, and feature ablation, but does not provide information on postprocessing steps. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
