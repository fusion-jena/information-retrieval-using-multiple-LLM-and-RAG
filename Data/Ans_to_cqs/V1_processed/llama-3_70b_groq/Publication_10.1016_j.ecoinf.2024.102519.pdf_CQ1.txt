Based on the provided context, it appears that the data collection methods used in this study are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer some information from the "Data sources and characteristics" table. The table lists various data sources, including DEM, Land use, NDVI, Soil data, Population, GDP, and Meteorological data, which are all in raster format with varying spatial resolutions. Additionally, there is a mention of Vector data and Statistical data from a statistical yearbook.

It can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected from existing datasets, such as satellite imagery (DEM, NDVI), land use maps, soil data, population and GDP statistics, and meteorological data. The vector data might be collected from GIS sources, and the statistical data from yearbooks. However, the exact methods used to collect these data are not specified.

It is also important to note that there is no mention of deep learning pipelines or surveys in the provided context. The context appears to be focused on ecosystem services supply and demand in the Weihe River Basin, and the data collection methods used are likely related to this specific study.
