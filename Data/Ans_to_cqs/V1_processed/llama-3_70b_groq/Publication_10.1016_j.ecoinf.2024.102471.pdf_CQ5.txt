The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a dataset containing vocalizations of 14 different bird species, recorded by the Central Poultry Development Organization (CPDO) in Bhubaneswar, India. This dataset is used for bird sound recognition tasks.

It's worth noting that the context focuses on architectures such as Hybrid CNN-LSTM, Vision Transformer, and Spike-based Neural Networks, which are applied to various tasks like image and audio processing, but it does not provide information about specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
