I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to forest fires, land use, and land cover, and discusses the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments and quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires. However, it does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
