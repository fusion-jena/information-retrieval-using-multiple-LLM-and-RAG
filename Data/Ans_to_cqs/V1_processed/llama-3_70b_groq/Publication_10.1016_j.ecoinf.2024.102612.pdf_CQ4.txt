Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions the importance of integrating augmented data simulations during the training phase of DL models to address the requirement for large training datasets in DNNs. It does not provide details on the specific techniques used for data augmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
