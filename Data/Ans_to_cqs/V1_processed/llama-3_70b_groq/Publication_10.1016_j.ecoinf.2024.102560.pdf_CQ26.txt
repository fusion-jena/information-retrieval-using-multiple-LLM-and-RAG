The provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental studies, discussing topics such as soil erosion, lake drying, and drought forecasting, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

The mentioned methodologies are related to data collection and analysis, such as using CMAP precipitation datasets, Landsat satellite datasets, and radiometric calibration for image processing. However, there is no mention of techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
