The context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, which suggests that a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used. Additionally, it also mentions modifying the architecture of YOLO, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Therefore, it can be inferred that a combination of RNN and CNN might be used in the pipeline.
