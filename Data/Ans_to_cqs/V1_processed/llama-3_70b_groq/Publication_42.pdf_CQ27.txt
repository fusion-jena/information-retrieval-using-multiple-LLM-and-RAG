I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different CNN architectures, their performance, and the hyperparameters used. It discusses the training process, model selection, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
