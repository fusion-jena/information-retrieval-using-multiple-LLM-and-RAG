I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs), literature searches, and data quality issues in surveys. It mentions machine learning techniques, but only in the context of SDMs, not deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
