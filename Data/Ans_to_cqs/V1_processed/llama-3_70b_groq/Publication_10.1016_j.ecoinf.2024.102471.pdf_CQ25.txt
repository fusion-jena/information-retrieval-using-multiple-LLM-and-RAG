The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is designed to classify bird species based on their calls, which involves processing large amounts of audio data to detect subtle differences between bird calls. The model is trained on a dataset of audio signals from various bird species and outputs a classification of the bird species. This is evident from the description of the Wav2Vec model, which includes a classification layer with a sigmoid activation function to decide on bird categories as output.
