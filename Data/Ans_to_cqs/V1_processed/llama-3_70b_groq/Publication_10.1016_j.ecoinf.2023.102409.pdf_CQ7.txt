I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to image segmentation, fractional vegetation coverage, and ecological restoration in an arid region, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. The context mentions the architecture and hyperparameters of the Deeplabv3+ model, but it does not discuss data splitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
