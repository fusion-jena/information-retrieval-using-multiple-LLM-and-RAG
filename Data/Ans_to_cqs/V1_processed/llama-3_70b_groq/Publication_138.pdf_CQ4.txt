The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, including the number of layers, filter sizes, strides, activation functions, and pooling operations. It does not provide information about data augmentation techniques used to preprocess the input data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
