Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental science and pollution patterns, with references to machine learning models, cluster analysis, and water quality monitoring. However, it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

The reference to Bilbao and Bilbao (2017) discusses the overfitting problem and over-training in the context of Artificial Neural Networks, but it does not mention preprocessing steps. The other references are not related to deep learning model preprocessing either.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
