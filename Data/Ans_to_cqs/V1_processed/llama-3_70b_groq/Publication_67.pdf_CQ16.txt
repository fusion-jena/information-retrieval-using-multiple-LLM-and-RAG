The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the phases of database construction, training, classification, and validation, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for the training process. 

Typically, in machine learning, the training process is stopped when a certain condition is met, such as a plateau in the validation loss, a maximum number of epochs, or a desired level of accuracy. However, this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular case.
