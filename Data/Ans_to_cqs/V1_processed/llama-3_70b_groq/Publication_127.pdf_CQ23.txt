The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for training and testing the models was split into training and test sets, as mentioned in the context. Additionally, the context mentions that 25% (757,000) nonempty images and randomly selected 757,000 empty images were used, which suggests that the dataset was diverse. However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting.

It is also worth noting that the context presents the results of different deep learning architectures on a specific task, but it does not provide detailed information about the experimental setup, including the measures taken to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that cross-validation or stratified splitting were used, and it is unclear what other measures might have been taken to ensure generalizability.
