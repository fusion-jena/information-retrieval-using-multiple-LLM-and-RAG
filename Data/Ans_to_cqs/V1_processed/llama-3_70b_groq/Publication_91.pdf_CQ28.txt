I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the details of the deep learning model, such as the batch size, learning rate, and data augmentation techniques, as well as the dataset used for training and testing. However, it does not provide information about the platform or infrastructure used to deploy the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
