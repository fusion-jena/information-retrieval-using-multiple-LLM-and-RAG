The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms for remote sensing data, specifically in aquatic environments. It discusses the efficacy of various AC models, such as FLAASH, and their applications in different satellite imagery.

There is no mention of deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
