Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics used in the study. It does not provide information on the dataset used, data preprocessing, or any techniques employed to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
