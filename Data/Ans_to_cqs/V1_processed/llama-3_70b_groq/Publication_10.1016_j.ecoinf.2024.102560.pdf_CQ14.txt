I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a research paper on drought monitoring and dust loading over a lake, and it discusses various methods and equations used in the research, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
