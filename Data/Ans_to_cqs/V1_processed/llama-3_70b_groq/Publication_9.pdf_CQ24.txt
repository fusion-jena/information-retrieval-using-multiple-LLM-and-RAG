Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in ecology and evolutionary biology, specifically for image segmentation and processing of fish images. It discusses the limitations of available image datasets, the potential of deep learning for automating data collection, and the presentation of a user-friendly toolkit called Sashimi for rapid image segmentation. 

There is no mention of random seed values or strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
