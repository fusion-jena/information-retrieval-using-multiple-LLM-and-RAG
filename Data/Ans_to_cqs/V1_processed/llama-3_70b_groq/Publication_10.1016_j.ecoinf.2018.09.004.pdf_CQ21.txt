The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the machine learning algorithms, which are Precision, Recall, and F-measure. These metrics are calculated using the true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of stratified cross-validation, which is a resampling technique used to evaluate the performance of the models. It does not mention other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix calculation. Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that the metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
