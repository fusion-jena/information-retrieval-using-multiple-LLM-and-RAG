The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It only mentions that the experiments were conducted on different dataset types, including Color, Gray scale, and Leaf Segmented, but it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been applied to the datasets.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular study.
