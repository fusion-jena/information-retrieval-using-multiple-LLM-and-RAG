The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the architecture and training of the SegFormer model, which is a Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation. It mentions the use of an AdamW optimizer, cosine annealing schedule, and Cross-Entropy loss function, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these components.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It could be TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework.
