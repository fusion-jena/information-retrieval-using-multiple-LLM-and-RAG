The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning pipeline or regularization methods to prevent overfitting. The context discusses the use of ensemble modeling approach in BIOMOD2 package in R, which includes regression-based and machine-learning models such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
