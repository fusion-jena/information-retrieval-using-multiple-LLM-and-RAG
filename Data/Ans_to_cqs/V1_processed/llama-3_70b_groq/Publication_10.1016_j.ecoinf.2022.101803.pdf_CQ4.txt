I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be discussing ensemble learning methods, specifically bagging and boosting, and their application to classification and regression trees (CARTs). It also mentions XGBoost and a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme to avoid overfitting. There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
