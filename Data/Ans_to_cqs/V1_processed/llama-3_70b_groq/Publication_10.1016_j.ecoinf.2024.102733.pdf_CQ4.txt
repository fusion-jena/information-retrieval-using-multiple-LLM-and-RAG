The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context only discusses the exploration of various hyperparameters for the autoencoder and MLP models, including learning rates, batch sizes, weight decay, dropout, and focal loss parameters. It does not provide any information about data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
