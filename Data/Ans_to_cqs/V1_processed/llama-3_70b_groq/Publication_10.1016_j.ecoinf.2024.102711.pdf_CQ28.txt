I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the development and training of data-driven models, specifically XGBoost and TABPFN, and their performance on a limited dataset. It also explains the process of hyperparameter tuning using k-fold cross-validation and the stacking approach. However, there is no mention of the platform used for deployment, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
