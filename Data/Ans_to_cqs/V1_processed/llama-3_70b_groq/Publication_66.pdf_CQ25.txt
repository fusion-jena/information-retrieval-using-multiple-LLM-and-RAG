The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used to predict diving behavior in seabirds based on GPS data. The model is trained to classify GPS tracking data into two categories: "dive" or "not dive". This is evident from the text, which mentions that the dependent variable to be predicted is the binary "dive/not dive" column. The model is used to identify patterns in the GPS data that are indicative of diving behavior, allowing researchers to predict when a seabird is likely to dive based on its movement patterns.
