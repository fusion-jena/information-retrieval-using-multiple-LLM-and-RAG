I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses Bayesian and non-Bayesian model pairs, including Bayesian logistic regression, MLE logistic regression, Bayesian GAM, and random forest. It also mentions the Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (2020) and the iterative modeling process. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or the frameworks used to build them. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
