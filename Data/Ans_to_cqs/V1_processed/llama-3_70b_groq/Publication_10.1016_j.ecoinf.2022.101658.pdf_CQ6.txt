The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention data augmentation strategies that were employed to increase the training set size fourfold. These strategies include horizontal flip, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction. The contrast reduction strategy was specifically motivated by the expectation of shadows occluding vegetation types in the images, which can be expected in the dataset.

It can be inferred that the data augmentation strategies were applied to the training images, but it is not clear if any other preprocessing steps were taken before training the deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the model, apart from the data augmentation strategies mentioned.
