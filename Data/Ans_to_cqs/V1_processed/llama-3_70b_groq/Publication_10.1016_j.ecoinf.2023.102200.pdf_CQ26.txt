The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on various applications of deep learning methods in image segmentation, object detection, and classification tasks in remote sensing and computer vision. 

However, it can be inferred that some of the papers might have used techniques to address data bias, but it is not explicitly stated. For instance, the paper by Liu et al. (2018) uses multi-view object-based analysis, which might help in reducing data bias. Similarly, the paper by Chen et al. (2021) uses PointNet, a deep learning architecture that can handle point cloud data, which might be less prone to data bias. 

But, without explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias, it is difficult to provide a specific answer. Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in the provided context.
