Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the use of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases, but it does not specify the exact purpose of the deep learning model. It mentions techniques such as classification and regression, but it does not clarify the specific goal of the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
