According to the provided context, measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Specifically, data augmentation techniques were used to increase the size of the dataset and make the CNN classification more robust and generalize better. The data augmentation techniques used include rotation, noise, and flip, which allowed the dataset to be augmented by six times. This suggests that the authors attempted to increase the diversity of the dataset to improve the model's generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used to ensure generalizability, such as k-fold cross-validation or bootstrapping. It is also not clear if the dataset was diverse in terms of representation of different classes, scenes, or conditions.

Therefore, while some measures were taken to improve generalizability, the context does not provide a comprehensive picture of the steps taken to ensure the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
