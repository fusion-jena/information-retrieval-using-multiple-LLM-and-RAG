I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of training samples, and the use of feature optimization tools to address these issues. However, it does not provide specific information about the deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) based on the given context.
