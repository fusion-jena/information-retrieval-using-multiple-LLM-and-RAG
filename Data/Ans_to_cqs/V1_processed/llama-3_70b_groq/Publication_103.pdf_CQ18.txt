The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the experiments related to cross-herbarium transfer learning, including the initialization, training, and testing of the neural network models. It discusses the different approaches used for pre-training, fine-tuning, and testing the models on various datasets. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
