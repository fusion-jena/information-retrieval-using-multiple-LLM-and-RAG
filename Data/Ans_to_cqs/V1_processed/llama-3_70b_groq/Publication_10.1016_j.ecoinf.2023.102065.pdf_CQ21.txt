The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It focuses on the data preparation, model training, and fine-tuning process. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context only evaluates the model performance with and without pre-training with external sound data, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.
