Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other techniques to ensure the model's generalizability. The context primarily focuses on the performance metrics of the CNN model, the dataset used, and the expert reading of the images. It does provide information about the dataset size, class weighting, and the number of epochs without improvement in validation error before training termination, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
