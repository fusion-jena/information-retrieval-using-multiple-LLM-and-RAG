According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

1. Rotation
2. Mirroring
3. Flipping

These techniques were applied to the tree samples in the form of patches to avoid the distinction of identical textures only differing from each other by orientation changes and to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the deep learning network.
