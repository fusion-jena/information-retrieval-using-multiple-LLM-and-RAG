Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to marine ecology and fisheries, with references to various research papers and datasets. It discusses topics such as tuna migration patterns, oceanography, and machine learning applications in marine ecology. However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
