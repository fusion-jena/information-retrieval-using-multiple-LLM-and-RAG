Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) for identifying ecological sources and allocating research units into different ecosystem service (ES) bundles. It discusses the use of SOFM for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, as well as the calculation of the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI) to determine the ideal number of bundles. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
