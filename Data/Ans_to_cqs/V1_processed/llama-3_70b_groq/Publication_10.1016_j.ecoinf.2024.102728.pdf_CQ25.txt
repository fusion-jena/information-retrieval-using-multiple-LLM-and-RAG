Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is object retrieval and feature extraction, specifically for aerial scene classification in remote sensing. This is evident from the paper by Petrovska et al. (2020), which explores the use of deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing, with a case study on aerial scene classification. Additionally, the context mentions object retrieval with deep convolutional neural networks (Mohedano et al., 2017), further supporting this answer.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide explicit information on other possible purposes of deep learning models, such as segmentation or detection. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the model is used for these purposes based on the provided information.
