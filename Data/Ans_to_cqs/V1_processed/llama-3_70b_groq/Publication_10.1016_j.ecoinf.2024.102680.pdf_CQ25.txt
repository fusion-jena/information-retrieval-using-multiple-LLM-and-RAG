The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of YOLOv8, a popular object detection algorithm, and the development of a new backbone network called CSMBDarknet for underwater object detection. The model is designed to detect objects in underwater optical images, which often have limited visibility due to complex imaging environments. The model aims to extract feature information from these images and detect objects of multiple sizes accurately.
