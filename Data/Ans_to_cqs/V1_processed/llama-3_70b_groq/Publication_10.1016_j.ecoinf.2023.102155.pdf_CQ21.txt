Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the ppmlasso package, its functions, and their arguments, as well as references to various research papers and methods related to statistical learning and presence-only analysis. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
