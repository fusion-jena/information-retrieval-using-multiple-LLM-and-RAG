I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for acoustic detection of Northern Bobwhite calls, and references other studies that have used similar approaches. However, it does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
