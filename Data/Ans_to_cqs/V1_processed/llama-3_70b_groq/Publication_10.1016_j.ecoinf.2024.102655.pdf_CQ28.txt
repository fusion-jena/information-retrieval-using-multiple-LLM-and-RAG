I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model on a specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be discussing the application of machine learning models to water quality index (WQI) data, but it does not provide information about the deployment of these models on a particular platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
