According to the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for the classification model are:

* Height and width shift
* Flipping
* Zooming
* Brightness changes

These techniques were used to augment the data during the training of the classification model. However, it is not specified whether these techniques were also applied to the PConv networks or Pix2Pix networks.
