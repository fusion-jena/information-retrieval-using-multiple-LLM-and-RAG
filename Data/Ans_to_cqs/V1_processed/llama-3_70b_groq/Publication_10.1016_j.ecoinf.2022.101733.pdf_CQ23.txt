The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the samples were selected according to a 60%â€“40% ratio for training and validation, respectively, and that the distribution of samples is represented in Fig. 8. This suggests that stratified splitting may have been used to ensure that the class proportions in the training and validation sets are representative of the real class proportions in the landscape. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, diverse datasets, or other measures to ensure generalizability. The context primarily focuses on the data collection, sample selection, and remote sensing applications, rather than the specifics of the deep learning model or its evaluation.
