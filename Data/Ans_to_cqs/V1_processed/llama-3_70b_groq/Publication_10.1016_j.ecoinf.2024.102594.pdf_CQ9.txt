I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the DeepLabV3+ model, its architecture, and its application to remote sensing images, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
