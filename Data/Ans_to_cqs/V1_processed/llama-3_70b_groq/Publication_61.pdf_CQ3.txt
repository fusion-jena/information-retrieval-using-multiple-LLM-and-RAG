I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the proposed approach for cactus recognition in aerial images, the importance of dataset extension, and the experimental setup for training the neural network. It discusses the use of a CNN, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
