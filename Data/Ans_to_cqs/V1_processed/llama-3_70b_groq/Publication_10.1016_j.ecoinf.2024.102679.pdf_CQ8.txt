I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where it can be found. The context appears to be an abstract or introduction to a research paper discussing the use of deep learning for wildlife population estimation using aerial surveys, but it does not include any details about the implementation or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
