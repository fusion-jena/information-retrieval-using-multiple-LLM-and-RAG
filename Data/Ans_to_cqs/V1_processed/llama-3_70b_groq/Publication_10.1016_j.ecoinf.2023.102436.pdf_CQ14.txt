I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the calculation of restorative potential scores, the aggregation of scores to form a matrix, and the construction of a restorative map using a statistical gap-filling technique. It also mentions the use of weights for each metric determined based on coefficients derived from regression analysis. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.
