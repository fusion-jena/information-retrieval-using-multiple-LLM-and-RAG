I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the effects of data reduction and augmentation on the classification accuracy of deep learning models, as well as the use of techniques like flattening convolution kernels to reduce hardware resource requirements. It does not provide information on how the data was annotated or prepared for training the models.
