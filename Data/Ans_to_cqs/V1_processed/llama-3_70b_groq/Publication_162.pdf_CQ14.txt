Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the use of a camera with LED flash to capture images of moths, image analysis to detect and classify moths, and the use of active learning to involve humans in the optimization of the system. It also mentions the use of classifiers and evaluation with a retained test set of images annotated manually. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
