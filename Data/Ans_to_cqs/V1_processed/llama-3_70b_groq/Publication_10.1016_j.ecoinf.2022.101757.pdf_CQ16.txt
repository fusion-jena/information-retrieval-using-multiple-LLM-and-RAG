I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are typically used to determine when training is complete in machine learning models. The context appears to be discussing the evaluation of metrics such as R2, sample variance, and absolute deviation for image classification tasks, but it does not provide information about the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
