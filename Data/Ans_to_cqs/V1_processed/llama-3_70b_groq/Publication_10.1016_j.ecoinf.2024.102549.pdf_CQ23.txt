Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of CNN architectures for predicting water quality and algal blooms, and it does not provide information on the dataset used, cross-validation, or stratified splitting techniques employed to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
