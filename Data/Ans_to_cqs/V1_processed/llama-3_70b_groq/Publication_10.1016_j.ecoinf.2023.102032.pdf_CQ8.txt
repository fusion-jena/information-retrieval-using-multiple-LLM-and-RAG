I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article or paper discussing the use of remote sensing and machine learning for wetland health assessment, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
