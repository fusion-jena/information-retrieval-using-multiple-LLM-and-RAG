Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and their applications in forest fire susceptibility prediction. It discusses the use of different machine learning algorithms, cross-validation, and ensemble methods, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
