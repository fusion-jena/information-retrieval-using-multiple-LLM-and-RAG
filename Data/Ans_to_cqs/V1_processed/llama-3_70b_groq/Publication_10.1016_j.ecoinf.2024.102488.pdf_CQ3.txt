I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and wetland mapping, with references to various machine learning algorithms and data sources, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
