Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the configuration of random forest (RF) training, the architecture of artificial neural networks (ANN), and the performance metrics of different machine learning models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
