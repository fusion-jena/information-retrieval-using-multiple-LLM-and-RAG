According to the provided context, the technique mentioned to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). This is mentioned in Section B, "The Training Regime", where it is stated that SMOTE, oversampling, or class weights were not used in the first stage of the research, but will be pursued in a second phase. 

No other techniques such as Stratified splitting, undersampling, or Diverse data collection are mentioned in the provided context.
