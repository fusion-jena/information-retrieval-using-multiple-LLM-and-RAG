Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, results, and discussions related to feature extraction and recognition for different poses. It does not provide information about the training process or the stopping criteria used.

The context does mention the use of different loss functions, such as cross-entropy and contrastive loss, but it does not specify how these loss functions are used to determine when training is complete. It is possible that the authors used a validation loss plateau or other criteria, but this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
