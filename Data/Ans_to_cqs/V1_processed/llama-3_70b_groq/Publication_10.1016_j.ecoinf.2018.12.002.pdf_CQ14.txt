The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of hidden Markov models and state-switching state space models for behavioral segmentation of animal movement paths, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. 

However, it does mention the use of Bayesian frameworks and MCMC methods for parameter estimation, which may imply that hyperparameter optimization is not a concern in this specific context. Additionally, it mentions the potential use of approximate Bayesian computation or particle Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to avoid MCMC convergence difficulties, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
