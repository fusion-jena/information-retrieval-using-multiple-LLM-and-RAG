The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the classification of fish species using a residual neural network (ResNet50V2) and the data collection process for estimating the composition of catches by species and sizes in the purse seine tropical tuna fisheries.

However, it is mentioned that the model was trained with data augmentation, which can be a strategy to handle randomness in the data. Data augmentation involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, flipping, or cropping. This can help the model generalize better to new, unseen data and reduce overfitting.

Other than data augmentation, the context does not provide information on specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
