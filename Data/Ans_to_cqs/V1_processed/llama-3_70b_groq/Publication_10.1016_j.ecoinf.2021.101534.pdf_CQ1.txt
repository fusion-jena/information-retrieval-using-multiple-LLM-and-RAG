Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in the deep learning pipeline is Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). PAM involves the use of audio recorders to collect sound data from the environment, which can then be used to identify and monitor animal species. This method is mentioned in the context as a survey method that is gaining increasing use in terrestrial ecology.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of audio clips, which are converted into spectrograms as input images for model training. This suggests that the raw data collection involves recording audio data, which is then processed and transformed into a format suitable for training a deep learning model.

It is not clear from the context whether public datasets are used, but it is likely that the audio data is collected through field recordings using sensors or audio recorders. Surveys are also mentioned as a method, but it is not clear if they are used for collecting raw data or for other purposes.

Overall, the primary method of raw data collection in this deep learning pipeline appears to be Passive Acoustic Monitoring using audio recorders.
