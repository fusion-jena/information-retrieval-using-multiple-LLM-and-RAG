I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline, nor does it provide any information about where the code is hosted. The text only discusses the use of Microsoft AI for Earth's Mega-Detector (V4.1) for processing wildlife camera trap images, but it does not provide any details about the code or its repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
