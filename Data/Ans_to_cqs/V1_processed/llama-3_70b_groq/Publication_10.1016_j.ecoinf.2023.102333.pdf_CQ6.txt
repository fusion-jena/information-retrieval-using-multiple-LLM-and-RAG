Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning, optimization algorithms, and regularization techniques for deep neural networks. It discusses the importance of optimizing model hyperparameters, different techniques for tuning hyperparameters, and the use of dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
