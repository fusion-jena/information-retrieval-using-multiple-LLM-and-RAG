I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context discusses various topics such as entropy maximization, neural networks, genetic programming, wavelet signal analysis, and input variable selection (IVS) algorithms, but it does not provide information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
