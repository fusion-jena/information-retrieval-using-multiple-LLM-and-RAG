The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various deep learning models such as ResNet-50, Inception-V3, CLIP, and Vision Transformer (ViT), and their applications in image classification tasks. It also mentions that CLIP was trained on 400 million images from the web along with their captions, but it does not provide information on how these images were collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context focuses on the models and their architectures, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.
