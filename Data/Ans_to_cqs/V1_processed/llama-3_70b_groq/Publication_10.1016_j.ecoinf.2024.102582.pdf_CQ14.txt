I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a study on mangrove forest landscape evolution, and it discusses the use of a spatial variance metric (q) to detect the factors influencing the evolution. It also provides the formula for calculating q and mentions the optimal spatial scale threshold for detection. However, it does not provide any information on model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
