I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the parameters used for detecting ungulate vocalizations, such as the FFT window size and frequency ranges, as well as the performance of different machine learning algorithms in detecting vocalizations. However, it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build the model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
