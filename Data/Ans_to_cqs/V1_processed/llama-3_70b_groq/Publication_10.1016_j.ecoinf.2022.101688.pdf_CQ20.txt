The hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are CPUs. Specifically, the model was trained on a virtual machine running the "E2asV4" instance on Microsoft Azure with 16GB RAM and a 2.35Ghz AMD EPYC 7452 2 vCPU. This is mentioned in the context as an attempt to verify that training could be executed on less expensive hardware, as opposed to the commonly used GPU hardware.
