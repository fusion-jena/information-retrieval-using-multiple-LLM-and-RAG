The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the structure of the CNN and LSTM models, the adjustment process of the solver for training the network, and the input time series length for all deep learning models. It also discusses the performance of the models in terms of RMSE and provides references to other studies. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
