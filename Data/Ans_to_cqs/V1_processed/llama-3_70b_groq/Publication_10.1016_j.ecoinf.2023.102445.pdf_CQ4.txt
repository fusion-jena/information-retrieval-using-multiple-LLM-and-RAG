I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the network, including the SPPF module, attention mechanism, and feature fusion techniques. It also discusses the experimental design and training parameters, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
