I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to biomass estimation, forest inventory, and remote sensing, but it does not provide any information about the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
