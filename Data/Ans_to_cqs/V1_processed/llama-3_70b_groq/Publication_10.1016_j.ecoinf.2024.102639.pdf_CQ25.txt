Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. The text discusses the integration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies in animal behavior studies, but it does not specify the particular task or objective of the deep learning model. 

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the model is likely used for prediction or forecasting behavioral patterns and movement trajectories of animals. The text mentions "predicting behavioral outcomes" and "forecasting behavioral patterns," which suggests that the model is used for some form of prediction or classification task. 

But without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, detection, or something else.
