The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. Additionally, the performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). The delta.AICc (delta in the Akaike minimum information criterion) is also used to determine the best tuning parameters.
