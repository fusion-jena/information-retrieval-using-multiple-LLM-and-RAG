Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily image-based. The references to "image retrieval", "multispectral features", "hyperspectral imaging", and "UAV multispectral features" suggest that image data is being used. Additionally, the mention of "color, shape, and texture features" in the context of plant leaf diseases implies that image data is being analyzed.

There is no explicit mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is a reference to "infrared spectroscopy" which may involve spectral data, but it is not clear if this is being used in a deep learning pipeline.

There is also a mention of "NDVI" (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) which is a type of index derived from remote sensing data, but it is not clear if this is being used as a data format in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, it appears that image data is the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline, but it is not possible to rule out the use of other data formats without more information.
