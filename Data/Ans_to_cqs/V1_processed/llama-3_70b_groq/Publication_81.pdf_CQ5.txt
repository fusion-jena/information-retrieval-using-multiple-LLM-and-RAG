The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context only mentions that the proposed model uses DNA barcode sequences of fish species from different families, but it does not specify a particular dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. These datasets are commonly used in image classification tasks, but the context suggests that the model is working with DNA barcode sequences, which is a different type of data. Therefore, I don't know the specific dataset used in this deep learning pipeline.
