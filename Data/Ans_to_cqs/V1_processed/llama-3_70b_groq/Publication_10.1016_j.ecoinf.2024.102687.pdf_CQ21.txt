Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the data acquisition process, the training dataset, and the fine-tuning of the pretrained CNN backbone. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that are typically performed after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
