I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The text discusses machine learning ensembles and mentions specific algorithms such as RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Additionally, the context focuses on species distribution modeling and socio-economics, which are not related to deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
