The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models. However, it does discuss the evaluation and creation of ensemble models for climate scenarios and periods. 

To ensure the robustness of the results, the authors applied committee averaging and weighted mean approaches to create separate ensemble models for each climate scenario and period. They also gave special attention to models with a TSS score of â‰¥0.7 when selecting the final ensemble models.

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or diverse datasets in the provided context. The authors did split their data into a training set (80% of the data) and an evaluation set (20% of the data) to assess model performance, but this is not specifically mentioned as a measure to ensure generalizability.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
