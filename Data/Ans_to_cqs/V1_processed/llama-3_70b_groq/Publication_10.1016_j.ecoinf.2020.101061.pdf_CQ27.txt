Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the approach used for airborne detection of individual tree crowns, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation. It discusses the use of a LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm for pretraining, data augmentation, and sensitivity studies, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
