Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of validation sets. The context mentions that the dataset is divided into three sets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The validation set is used to validate the trained model, which implies that the model's performance is monitored during training using the validation set.

Additionally, Figure 7 and Figure 8 in the context show the model accuracy over plain data and encrypted data, respectively, with both training accuracy and validation accuracy plotted. This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored during training by tracking both the training accuracy and validation accuracy.

However, the exact strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance during training are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
