Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Model validation: The data was used to validate model predictions.
2. Metrics calculation: The Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric and True Skill Statistics (TSS) were used to assess the performance of model predictions.
3. Thresholding: A threshold value of 0.6 was derived from equal training sensitivity and specificity to classify the predictive maps into unsuitable (0–0.6) and suitable (0.6–1) areas.
4. Comparison of predictive maps: The predictive maps of four groups of orchids during three time periods (current, future (2100) using SSP 1–2.6, and future (2100) using SSP 5–8.5) were compared to identify the potential impact of climate change and land cover change on suitable areas for each group.

There is no mention of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix in the provided context.
