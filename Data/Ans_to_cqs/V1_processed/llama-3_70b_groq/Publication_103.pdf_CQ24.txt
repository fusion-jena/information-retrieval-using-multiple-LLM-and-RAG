Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the experiments and results of deep learning models for herbarium species identification.

However, it is worth noting that one of the experiments, "R.CR.CR", initializes the neural network randomly, which suggests that randomness is introduced in the model initialization. But there is no further discussion on how randomness is handled or controlled throughout the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the given context.
