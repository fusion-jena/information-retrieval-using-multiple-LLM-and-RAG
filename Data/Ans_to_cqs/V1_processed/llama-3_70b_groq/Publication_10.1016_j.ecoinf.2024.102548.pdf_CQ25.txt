The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context, such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2, is for classification tasks. This is evident from Section 2, which mentions that the evaluation of model performance was based on the accuracy metric, indicating that the models were used for classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions that the class mode was set to 'categorical', which is typically used for multi-class classification tasks.
