I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository where the data is stored. The context discusses the acquisition and preprocessing of GF-6 remote sensing data, various models for bathymetry retrieval, and the implementation of CART and RFR models. However, it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
