I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various papers and articles, but it does not provide information about the implementation or evaluation of a specific deep learning model.

There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. The context does provide some information about machine learning algorithms, such as backpropagation and neural networks, but it does not provide enough information to answer the query.
