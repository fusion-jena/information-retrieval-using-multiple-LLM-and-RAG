Based on the provided context, it appears that a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) deep learning model is used in the pipeline. This is mentioned in the paper by Sharma et al. (2020), which discusses the use of a CNN deep learning model with fine-tuned Word2Vec for sentimental short sentence classification. However, it is not clear if this is the only deep learning model used in the pipeline or if other models are also employed.
