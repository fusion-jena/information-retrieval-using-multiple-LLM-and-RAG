I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, species distribution, and climate change, with references to maximum entropy models and papers on ecological modeling. There is no indication of the use of deep learning models in the pipeline.
