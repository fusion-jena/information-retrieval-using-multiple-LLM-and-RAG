To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the tiles retrieved from all 50 training photographs were collected in one folder and shuffled before being split into training, validation, and test sets. This was done to prevent spatial autocorrelation between neighboring tiles. 

Secondly, data augmentation was performed on the training set to artificially increase the number of training samples by applying slight transformations on the original data. This helps to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.

Thirdly, the model was trained and validated on separate sets, with the validation set being used for fine-tuning of hyperparameters and model selection. The performance of the final model was then evaluated on a separate test set, which was not used during training. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen data.

Lastly, the model was evaluated on two different data sets: individual tiles and whole repeat photographs. This helps to assess the model's performance on different levels of data granularity and increases confidence in its generalizability.

However, it is worth noting that cross-validation and stratified splitting were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
