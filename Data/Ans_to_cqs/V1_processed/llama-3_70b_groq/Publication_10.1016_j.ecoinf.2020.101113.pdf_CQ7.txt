Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the preprocessing of input images, the use of a pre-trained ResNet50 model, and the implementation of feature extraction layers and fully connected layers. It also discusses the importance of location-specific training data in acoustic monitoring systems.

However, it is mentioned that the training data consisted primarily of recordings targeting single foreground species, and a smaller validation set of annotated soundscapes was also used. This implies that the data was split into training and validation sets, but the specific criteria for this split are not provided.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this specific context.
