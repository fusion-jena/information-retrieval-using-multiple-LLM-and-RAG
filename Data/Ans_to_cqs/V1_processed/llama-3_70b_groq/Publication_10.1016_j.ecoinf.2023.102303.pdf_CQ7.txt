Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methodologies to advance state-of-the-art underwater fish video processing techniques in turbid waters. It discusses the development of a weakly-supervised database, proposes two DNN structures, and evaluates their accuracy. However, it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
