I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the platform used for deployment. The context appears to be related to a research paper on non-invasive survey methods for wildlife conservation, and it discusses the development of a method called FIT, but it does not provide information about the deployment of a deep learning model or the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
