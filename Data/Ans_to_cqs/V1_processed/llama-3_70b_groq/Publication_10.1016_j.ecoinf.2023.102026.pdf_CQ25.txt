The purpose of the Random Forest (RF) model in this context is species distribution modeling. Specifically, it is used to produce species distribution probability surfaces for each felid (a type of big cat). The RF model is trained on camera trap data, including presence and absence locations, to predict the probability of species presence across different locations.
