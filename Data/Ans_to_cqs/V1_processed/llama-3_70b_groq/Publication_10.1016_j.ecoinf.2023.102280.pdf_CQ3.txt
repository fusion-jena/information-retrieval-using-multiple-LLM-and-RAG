I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on deep noise reduction methods, their applications in bioacoustics, and the challenges of developing large-scale datasets for these applications. It discusses the use of U-net architectures, transformer attention mechanisms, and raw waveform data, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
