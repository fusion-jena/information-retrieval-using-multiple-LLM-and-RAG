The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization. This is stated in the text as "Instead of manually selecting the hyperparameters, we employed Bayesian optimization to find their optimal values for each of the six models." Bayesian optimization is a method that uses a Gaussian process model of the objective function to optimize variables such as network section depth, batch size, initial learning rate, momentum, and regularization strength. In this study, the batch size (between 1 and 32) and initial learning rate (between 1×10-4 and 1×10-2) were optimized.
