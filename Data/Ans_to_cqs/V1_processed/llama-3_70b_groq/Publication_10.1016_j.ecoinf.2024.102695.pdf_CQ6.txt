Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training process, and experimental setup. It discusses the input tensor dimensions, attention calculation, and model hyperparameters, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular case, as they are not mentioned in the provided context.
