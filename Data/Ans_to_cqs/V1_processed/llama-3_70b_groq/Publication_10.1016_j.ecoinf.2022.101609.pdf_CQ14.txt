The context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that "automated hyperparameter tuning was implemented using Bayesian optimisation." This suggests that Bayesian optimization was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, rather than grid search or random search.
