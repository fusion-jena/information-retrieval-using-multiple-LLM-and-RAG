Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on deep learning architectures, their performance, and a brief introduction to deep learning concepts. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation is an essential step in deep learning pipelines, as it helps increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, reducing overfitting and improving model generalization. However, the context does not provide any information on the specific techniques used for data augmentation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
