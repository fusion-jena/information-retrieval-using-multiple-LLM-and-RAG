I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of deep learning models in the remote sensing domain, the drivers and mechanisms of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC), and the potential for optimization and improvement of the deep learning model. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
