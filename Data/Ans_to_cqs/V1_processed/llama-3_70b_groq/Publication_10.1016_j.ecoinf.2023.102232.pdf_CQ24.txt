The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to discuss a hybrid MCMC algorithm and a genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter estimation in an ODE system. It mentions the use of random values generated from Gaussian distributions, but it does not discuss deep learning or random seed values.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not provide any information about deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
