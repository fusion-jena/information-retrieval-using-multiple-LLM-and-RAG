Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on object detection using CNNs, feature maps, and anchor boxes, as well as the performance of different ResNet models with FPN. It discusses issues related to spatial resolution, object size, and dataset imbalance, but does not address randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
