The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameters used in the no-overfitting and overfitting settings, such as the learning rate, weight decay, batch size, number of training epochs, and use of batch-norm and dropout. However, it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were chosen or optimized.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query, as the context does not provide sufficient information on the hyperparameter optimization method used. It could be grid search, random search, or any other method, but it is not specified in the provided context.
