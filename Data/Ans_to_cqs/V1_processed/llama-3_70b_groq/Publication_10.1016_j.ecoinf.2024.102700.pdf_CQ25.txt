I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. It only mentions that deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, were used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023). However, it does not specify the purpose or task of these deep learning models, such as classification, segmentation, detection, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
