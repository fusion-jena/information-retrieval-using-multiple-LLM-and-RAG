I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model. The context discusses variable importance, decision trees, random forests, chi-square, and regression, but it does not mention deep learning models or frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
