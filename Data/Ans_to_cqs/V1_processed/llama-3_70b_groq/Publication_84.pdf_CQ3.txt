The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE), for remote sensing image classification, specifically for detecting invasive species. It discusses the comparison of SAE with traditional machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
