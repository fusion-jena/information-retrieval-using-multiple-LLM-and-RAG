The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their purposes. The context discusses machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), but it does not mention deep learning models.

The purpose of the machine learning algorithms mentioned in the context is classification. For example, the K-nearest neighbors algorithm is used for classification, where a query point is assigned the data class that has the most representatives within the nearest neighbors of the point. Similarly, Decision Trees and SVMs are also used for classification.

However, since the query asks about deep learning models, and deep learning is not mentioned in the provided context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
