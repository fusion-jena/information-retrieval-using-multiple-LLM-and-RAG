The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques to overcome the problem of limited data and improve model performance. It discusses various audio-specific augmentation techniques, such as noise mixing, random signal amplitude, sound mixing with other target signals, and reverberations. 

However, it does mention that default data augmentation including scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation were used during the training process. This suggests that data augmentation is used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in this deep learning pipeline.
