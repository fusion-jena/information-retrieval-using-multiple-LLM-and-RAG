I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the results of the original, reduced, and augmented datasets applied to the deep learning model, and outlines the overall study process, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
