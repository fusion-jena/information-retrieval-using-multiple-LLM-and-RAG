I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context discusses the analysis of COVID-19 cases, air pollution data, and references various research papers, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
