The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the data was split into two datasets: a training dataset with 85% of the images (111,244/130,858) and a validation dataset with 15% of the images (19,614/130,858). This split is a common practice in deep learning, where a large portion of the data is used for training the model and a smaller portion is used for validation to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
