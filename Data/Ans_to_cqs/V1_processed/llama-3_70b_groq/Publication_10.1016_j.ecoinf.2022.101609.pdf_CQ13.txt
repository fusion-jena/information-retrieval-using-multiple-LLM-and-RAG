The context provides some information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. 

The learning rate was fixed at the point where the plot started dipping, which is 10^(-4) (cid:0) as shown in Fig. 11. 

As for the optimizer, the context mentions that a series of experiments were carried out on popular optimization functions such as SGD, RMSProp, LAMB, LARS, and Adam. However, it does not specify which optimizer was finally chosen for the model.

Additionally, the context mentions a "steep value" of 1.3e, but it is not clear what this refers to in the context of the deep learning model.

No information is provided about other hyperparameters such as batch size, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, etc.
