I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance during training. The text appears to be discussing valve gaping in shellfish, its relation to temperature and chlorophyll, and the potential applications of big data in aquaculture decision making. It also mentions data analysis using R and provides details about the data processing steps, but it does not mention model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
