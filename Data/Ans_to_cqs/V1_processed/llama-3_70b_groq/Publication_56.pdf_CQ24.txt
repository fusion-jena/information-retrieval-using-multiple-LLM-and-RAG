Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models in agricultural remote sensing, particularly in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). It discusses the importance of explainable predictions, the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for land use classification, and the analysis of remote sensing data.

The context does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting random seed values, using techniques like dropout or batch normalization, or employing ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
