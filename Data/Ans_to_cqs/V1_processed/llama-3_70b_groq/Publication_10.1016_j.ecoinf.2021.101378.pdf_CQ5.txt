I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and machine learning applications in ecology, with references to datasets related to environmental variables, land-use types, and pine wilt disease. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
