The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on heterogeneous ensemble learning techniques, such as weighted average (WA) and stacking, to improve the performance of landslide susceptibility models. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of addressing biases and improving the effectiveness of models through the use of heterogeneous ensemble techniques. It also mentions that the study will investigate the scalability and transferability of the ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models.

In general, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context.
