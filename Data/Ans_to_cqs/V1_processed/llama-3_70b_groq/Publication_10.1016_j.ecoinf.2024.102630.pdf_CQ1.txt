Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods utilized in this study involve remote sensing data from various satellite sensors. Specifically, the study uses the following datasets:

1. MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI) from the Google Earth Engine platform, which provides 16-day synthesized data.
2. Daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI) from the Google Earth Engine platform.
3. The third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI) from the Google Earth Engine platform.
4. SPOT/VEGETATION products (SPOT NDVI) from the Resource and Environmental Data Center.

These datasets are likely collected through satellite remote sensing, where sensors on board satellites capture data about the Earth's surface. The data is then processed and made available through various platforms, such as the Google Earth Engine.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for raw data collection in this study.
