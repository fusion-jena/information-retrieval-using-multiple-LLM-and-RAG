I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a study on forest fuel loading and semantic segmentation, and it discusses the methodology, study sites, and formulas used for fuel load calculation. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search.
