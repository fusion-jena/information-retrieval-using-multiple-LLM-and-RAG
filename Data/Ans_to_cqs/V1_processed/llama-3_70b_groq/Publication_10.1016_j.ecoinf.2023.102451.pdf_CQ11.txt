I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the dataset used is a publicly available dataset of environmental microorganisms called EMDS-6, but it does not provide a link to access the dataset. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
