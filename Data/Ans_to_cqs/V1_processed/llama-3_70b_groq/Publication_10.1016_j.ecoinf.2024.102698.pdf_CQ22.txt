The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention some utility metrics used to evaluate the quality of the synthetic data generated by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. These metrics include Ï‡2 test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, correlation scores, mean data quality score, and mean data diagnostics scores. 

It is not clear if these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model itself or just to evaluate the quality of the generated synthetic data. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
