The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy. The loss and accuracy curves of the reported network are also provided in Fig. 5, which suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training by tracking these metrics. Additionally, the optimizer AdamW and the learning rate of 0.002 are used, which may also be part of the strategy to monitor and adjust the model's performance during training. However, the exact strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not clearly stated.
