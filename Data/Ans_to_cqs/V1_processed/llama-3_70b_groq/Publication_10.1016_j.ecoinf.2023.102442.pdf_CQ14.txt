The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context only mentions that certain parameters are "ADJUSTABLE PARAMETERS", such as the buffer distance in step 8, the ratio of mine-urban pixels in step 9, and the proximity distance in step 19. However, it does not provide information on how these parameters are optimized or tuned.

It is possible that the authors of the model used a method such as grid search, random search, or another optimization technique to find the best combination of hyperparameters, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided information.
