I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link associated with it. The context mentions various sources such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), QGIS, and R packages, but it does not provide a link to a specific data repository related to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
