I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to landscape photographs, environmental performance evaluation, and 3D landscape indexes, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
