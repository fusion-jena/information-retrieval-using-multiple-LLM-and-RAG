I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the model architectures, hyperparameters, and training procedures for PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks. It also mentions data augmentation techniques, such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
