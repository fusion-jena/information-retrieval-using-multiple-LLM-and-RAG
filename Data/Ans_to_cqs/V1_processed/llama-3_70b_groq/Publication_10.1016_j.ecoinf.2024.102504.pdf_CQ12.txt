Based on the provided context, it is mentioned in the first reference (Navares, R., Aznarte, J.L., 2020) that a deep learning LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is used for predicting air quality. Additionally, in the last part of the context, it is mentioned that the LSTM deep learning model outperformed other models in predicting PM2.5 levels. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is LSTM, which is a type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network).
