The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that a form of cross-validation is used to evaluate the model's performance. 

The text mentions that the prediction error was obtained by calculating Ì‚ym+ma (cid:0) ym+ma at different starting times. This suggests that the model is trained and validated multiple times with different starting times, and the prediction error is calculated for each iteration. This approach ensures that each forecast is a fair cross-validation, as the model is not using any information that is not accessible at the start of the prediction period.

While the exact strategy for monitoring model performance during training is not specified, it appears that the model's performance is evaluated through a form of cross-validation, where the model is trained and validated multiple times with different starting times, and the prediction error is calculated for each iteration.
