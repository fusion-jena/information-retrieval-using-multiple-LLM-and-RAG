The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text focuses on the DialectDecoder system, which uses machine learning and human anomaly identification to classify bird songs. It discusses the data preparation, training, and testing processes, but does not provide information on how randomness is handled.

In particular, there is no mention of setting a random seed value, which is a common strategy to ensure reproducibility in deep learning experiments. The text also does not discuss other techniques to handle randomness, such as data shuffling, batch normalization, or dropout.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
