I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models, GPUs, or TPUs. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, color blindness, and scientific communication, with references to articles and research papers on these topics. There is no mention of hardware resources or deep learning models, so it is not possible to determine which hardware resources are used for training a deep learning model.
