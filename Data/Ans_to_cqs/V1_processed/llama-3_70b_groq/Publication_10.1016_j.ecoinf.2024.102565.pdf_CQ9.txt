I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored. The context appears to be a research article or paper that discusses the use of machine learning models, specifically neural networks, for lake total suspended matter retrieval by wind speed. It provides references to various research papers and books, but it does not mention a data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
