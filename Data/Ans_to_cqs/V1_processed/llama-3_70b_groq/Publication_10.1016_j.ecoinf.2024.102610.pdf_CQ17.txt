The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on machine learning techniques, particularly random forests, and feature elimination methods like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF).

However, it does mention that creating a mask to delineate the "area of applicability" for the trained model can help prevent potential performance degradation and avoid overfitting. This approach is not a traditional regularization method, but rather a way to filter out regions lacking training data.

In summary, the context does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting.
