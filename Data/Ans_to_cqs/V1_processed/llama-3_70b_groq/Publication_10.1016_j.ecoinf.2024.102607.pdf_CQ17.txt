The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses sampling strategies for addressing unbalanced training data in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, including undersampling, oversampling, and combinations of both. It also mentions the use of a hexagonal random-sampling strategy and a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping.

While the context does mention the problem of overfitting as a potential consequence of an incorrect sampling strategy, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
