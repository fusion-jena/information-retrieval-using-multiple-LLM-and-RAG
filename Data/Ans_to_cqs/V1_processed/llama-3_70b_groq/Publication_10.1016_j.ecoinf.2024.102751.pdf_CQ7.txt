I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to a study on estimating soil moisture on a reclaimed spoil heap using remote sensing data and topographic indices, but it does not discuss the specifics of deep learning model training or data splitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
