The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameters used for training the models, such as the initial learning rate, batch normalization, and the number of epochs. It does not provide information on whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
