Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "Further advantages of data augmentation on convolutional neural networks" in reference 33, which suggests that data augmentation was used, but the specific techniques are not specified. Therefore, I don't know the exact data augmentation techniques used in this pipeline.
