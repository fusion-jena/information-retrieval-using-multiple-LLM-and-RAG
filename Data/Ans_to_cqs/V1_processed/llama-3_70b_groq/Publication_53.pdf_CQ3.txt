The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that a random subsample of 400 images was labelled into "dam" or "not dam" for training a classification model. There is no mention of bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or any other specific annotation techniques. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact annotation techniques used in this study.
