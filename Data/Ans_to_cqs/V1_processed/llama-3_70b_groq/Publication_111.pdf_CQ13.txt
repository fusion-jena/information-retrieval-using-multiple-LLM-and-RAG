The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context focuses on the hyperparameters of the GRU-DNN model, specifically the number of previous observations (K) used in the training and forecasting task, and the search spaces for determining the best model hyperparameter values. It also mentions the use of the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) method in the Hyperopt package for parameter finding and optimization. However, it does not provide information about the learning rate and optimizer used in the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
