The framework used to build the deep learning model is PyTorch. This is evident from the code snippet provided, which uses the `cnn_learner` function and specifies the architecture as `resnet18()`. This is a PyTorch-based implementation. Additionally, the context mentions the paper "PyTorch: An Imperative Style, High-Performance Deep Learning Library" by Paszke et al. (2019), which further supports the use of PyTorch as the framework.
