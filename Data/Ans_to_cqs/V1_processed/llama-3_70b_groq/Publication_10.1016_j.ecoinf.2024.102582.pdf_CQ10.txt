I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses a research study on mangrove species, image processing, and remote sensing data, but it does not provide any information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The references cited in the context are academic papers and do not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
