The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and the Apriori algorithm for identifying frequent itemsets. It discusses the process of data acquisition and processing, including steps like identification of the aim, pre-selection of useful data, analytical determinations, and optimization and elaboration of results.

The only optimization technique mentioned in the context is pruning, which is a data compression technique used in machine learning and search algorithms to reduce the size of decision trees and improve predictive accuracy by reducing overfitting. However, this is not related to deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques like SGD or Adam.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the discussed topics.
