I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on building a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network using MATLAB R2014b for predicting Trophic State Index (TSI) based on spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter. The context explains the architecture of the neural network, the input and output layers, and the training process, but it does not provide information on deploying the trained model.
