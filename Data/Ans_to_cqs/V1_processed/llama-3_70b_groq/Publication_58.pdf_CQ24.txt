The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text focuses on the preprocessing of satellite data, the splitting of data into learning, validation, and test sets, and the architecture of the Deep Learning models used. It also discusses the importance of balanced data sets and the methods used to achieve this.

However, it is worth noting that the text does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent as the training protocol for the Deep Learning architectures. This implies that some level of randomness is introduced during the training process, but the context does not provide further information on how this randomness is handled or controlled.

In general, setting a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility of results. This is not mentioned in the provided context, so it is unclear whether this strategy was employed in this particular study.
