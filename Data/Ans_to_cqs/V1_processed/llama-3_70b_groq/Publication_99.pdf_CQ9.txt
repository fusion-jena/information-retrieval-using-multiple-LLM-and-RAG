I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and parameters used for training the classification model, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
