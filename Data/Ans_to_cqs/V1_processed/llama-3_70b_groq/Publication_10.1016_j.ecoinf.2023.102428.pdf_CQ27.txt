I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the research design, data processing, and the MLPnn-MC model description, but it does not provide information on model deployment. It discusses the model's architecture, performance, and results, but it does not elaborate on the deployment process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
