Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically RGB images. This is evident from the mention of "RGB channels" and "ImageNet mean" in the context, which suggests that the input data is image-based. Additionally, the context mentions "airborne imagery" and "tree identification", which further supports the idea that image data is being used. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the context, so it can be concluded that image data is the primary format used in the deep learning pipeline.
