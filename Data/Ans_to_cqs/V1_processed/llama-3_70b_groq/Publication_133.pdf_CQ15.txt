Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text explains the general process of model training, including the use of a loss function and its gradient to modify model parameters, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used to update the parameters.

The context focuses more on the architecture of the YOLOv5 model, its application to insect ecinformatics, and the use of validation data to prevent overfitting. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
