Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to be focused on remote sensing, soil mapping, and land cover classification, with references to various machine learning algorithms and techniques. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, k-fold cross-validation, and time-series splitting, among others. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used in this context.

If you have any additional context or information, I may be able to provide a more specific answer.
