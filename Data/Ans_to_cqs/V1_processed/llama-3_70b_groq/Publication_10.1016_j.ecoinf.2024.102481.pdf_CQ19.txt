I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model. The text discusses the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, particularly Random Forest (RF) models, in analyzing complex databases and predicting reproductive condition in fish. It mentions the advantages of ML techniques over traditional statistical methods, but it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build the models. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the deep learning model.
