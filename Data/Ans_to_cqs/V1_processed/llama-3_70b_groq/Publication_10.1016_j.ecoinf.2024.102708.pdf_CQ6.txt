Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models (YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN) for object detection tasks, specifically for detecting Pacific oysters. It discusses the model architectures, their performance, and limitations, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
