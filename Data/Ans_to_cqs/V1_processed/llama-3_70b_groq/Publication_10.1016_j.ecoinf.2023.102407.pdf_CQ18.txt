The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using certain metrics, such as AUC and TSS, as mentioned in Table 5. The performance curves of different models are also shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6, which suggests that the model performance is being monitored and compared during training. Additionally, the effect of the incremental pseudo-labeling (PL) strategy on the model performance is investigated, and the results show that the model performance improves with the optimal choice of the hyperparameter K. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training is not clearly stated.
