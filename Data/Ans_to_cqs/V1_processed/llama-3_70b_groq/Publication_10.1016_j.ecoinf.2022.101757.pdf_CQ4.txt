I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context discusses semantic segmentation, deep learning-based methods, and the use of the COCO dataset for training computer vision models, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
