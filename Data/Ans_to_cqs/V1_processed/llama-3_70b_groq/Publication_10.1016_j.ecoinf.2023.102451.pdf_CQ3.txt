I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the EMViT-Net model, its experimental setup, and its application to environmental microorganism classification. It does not provide information on the data annotation process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
