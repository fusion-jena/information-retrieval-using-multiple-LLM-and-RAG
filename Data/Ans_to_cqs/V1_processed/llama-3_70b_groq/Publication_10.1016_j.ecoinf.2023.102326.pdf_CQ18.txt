I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or performance monitoring. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, land use types, and acoustic data analysis, but it does not provide any information about machine learning models or their training processes. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
