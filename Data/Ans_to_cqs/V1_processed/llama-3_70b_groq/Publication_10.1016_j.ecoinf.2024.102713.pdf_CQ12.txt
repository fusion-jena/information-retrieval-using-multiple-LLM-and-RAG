I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning model or pipeline. It discusses the relational schema of CASE's database, data sources, and the integration and enrichment processes of the data platform. There is no mention of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
