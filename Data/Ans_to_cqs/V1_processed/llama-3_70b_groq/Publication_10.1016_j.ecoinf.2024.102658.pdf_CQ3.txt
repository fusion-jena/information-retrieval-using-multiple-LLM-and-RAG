I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDMs) and discusses feature sets, Bayesian workflow, and machine learning models like random forest, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
