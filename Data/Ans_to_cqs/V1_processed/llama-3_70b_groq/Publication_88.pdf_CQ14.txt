Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the architecture of the EF network, the performance metrics used, and the results of the experiments, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
