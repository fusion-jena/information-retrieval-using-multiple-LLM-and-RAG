Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of deep learning models for identifying Collembola species, including the use of mean average precision (mAP) and average precision (AP) metrics, and the training protocols for Faster R-CNN models. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
