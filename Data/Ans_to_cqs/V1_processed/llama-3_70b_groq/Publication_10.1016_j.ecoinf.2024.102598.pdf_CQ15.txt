I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily discusses ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and their performance in forest fire susceptibility mapping. It mentions various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART), but does not provide information on optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
