The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text only mentions that "The detection, feature extraction and classification workflow developed in this paper have been implemented in a set of MATLAB codes" and that "the approach presented here is software independent." There is no mention of a specific code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I don't know where the code repository is available.
