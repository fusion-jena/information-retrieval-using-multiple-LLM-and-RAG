I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various research papers and methods related to image classification and object detection for pest species, but it does not provide information about the data repository. The context mentions references to research papers and datasets, but it does not specify where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
