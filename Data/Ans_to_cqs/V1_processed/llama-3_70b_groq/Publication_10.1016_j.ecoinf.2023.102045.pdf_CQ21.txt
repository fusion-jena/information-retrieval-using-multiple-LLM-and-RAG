I don't know.

The provided context does not mention model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to colour blindness, computational ecology, ecological informatics, mapping, and scientific communication, with references to R packages and articles on colour vision deficiency, visual display of quantitative information, and colour maps for oceanography. There is no mention of machine learning or model training, which is typically where postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrix would be relevant.
