I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about building a deep learning model or using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be discussing an ecological model, specifically an environmental flow model, and its parameters, data requirements, and computational costs. There is no mention of deep learning or any related frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
