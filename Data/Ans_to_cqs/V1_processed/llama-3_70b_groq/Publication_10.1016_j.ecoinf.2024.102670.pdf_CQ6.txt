Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in various domains, such as karyotyping images of chromosomes, segmentation models, and 3D volumetric images. It discusses the challenges of obtaining ground truth data, the efficacy of crowd-sourcing for manual annotation, and the performance of deep learning models compared to other methods.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, data augmentation, and feature engineering, depending on the specific problem and dataset. Normalization and scaling are often used to ensure that the input data has a similar range or distribution, which can improve the model's performance and stability. Cleaning involves removing noisy or irrelevant data, and data augmentation involves generating additional data from the existing dataset to increase its size and diversity.

In the absence of specific information about the preprocessing steps in the provided context, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
