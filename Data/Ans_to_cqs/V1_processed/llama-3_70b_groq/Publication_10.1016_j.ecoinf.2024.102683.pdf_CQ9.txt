I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the importance of attention mechanisms in deep learning, the use of data augmentation to overcome overfitting, and the proposed approach (SCAM-Herb model) for identifying medicinal plants. It also presents the results of the model's performance. However, it does not provide information about the data repository where the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF).
