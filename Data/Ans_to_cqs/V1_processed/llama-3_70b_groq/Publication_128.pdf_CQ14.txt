The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific values chosen for certain hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, dropout rate, batch size, and number of epochs. However, it does not provide information on how these values were determined or if any hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as grid search or random search, were used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
