Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on discussing the total model parameters, total layers in the model, and the performance of different models on a classification task. It also outlines the organization of the article and presents related work in the field. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, data splitting is a crucial step in machine learning and deep learning model training. Common practices include splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, typically in a ratio of 80:10:10 or 70:15:15. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. However, without specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular study.
