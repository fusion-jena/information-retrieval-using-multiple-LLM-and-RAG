I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to a study on environmental variables such as respiration, solar radiation, air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation, and discusses data collection and processing, methodology, and author contributions. There is no mention of deep learning or image processing, which are typically the domains where data augmentation techniques are applied. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
