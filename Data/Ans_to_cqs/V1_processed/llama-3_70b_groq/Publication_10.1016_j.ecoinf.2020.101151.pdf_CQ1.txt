I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on fire weather indices and vegetation, and it discusses the use of data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
