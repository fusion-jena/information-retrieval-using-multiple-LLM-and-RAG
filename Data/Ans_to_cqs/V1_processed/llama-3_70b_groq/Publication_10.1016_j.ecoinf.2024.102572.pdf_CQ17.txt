Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on land use and land cover data, satellite imagery, and geospatial computations for quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires. It discusses the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments and mentions the incorporation of high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite photos on a cloud platform. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
