The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search. This is stated in the context as "For the grid search, we focused on minimizing the MSE to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters." Additionally, Table 2 provides an overview of the explored ranges of hyperparameters used in the Optuna grid search, which further supports the use of grid search for hyperparameter optimization.
