I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning models, including random forest, multilayer perceptron, long-short term memory, and support vector regression, for predicting algal-related parameters and identifying drivers of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). It also discusses uncertainty quantification and hyperparameter optimization in the context of HABs monitoring and prediction. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
