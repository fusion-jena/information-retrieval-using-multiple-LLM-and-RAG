Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the pre-processing of imagery, segmentation, and classification strategies in eCognition, and the opportunities of the modeling approach. It does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the context is related to ecological informatics and involves the use of historical imagery. It is possible that the raw data is collected through aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources, as mentioned in the context. But, it does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, I don't know the exact answer to the query, and further information is required to determine the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
