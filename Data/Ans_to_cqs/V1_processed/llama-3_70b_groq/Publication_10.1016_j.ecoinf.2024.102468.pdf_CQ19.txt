I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions "Birdnet: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" in the reference by Kahl et al. (2021), but it does not specify the framework used to build Birdnet. It is possible that the framework used is TensorFlow, PyTorch, or something else, but this information is not provided in the given context.
