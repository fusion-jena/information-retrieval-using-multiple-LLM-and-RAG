The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on forest fire danger prediction, discussing the combination of factors such as FWI, FFMC, and human impact, and the weighting of these factors in different variants. There is no mention of deep learning, preprocessing, or techniques to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
