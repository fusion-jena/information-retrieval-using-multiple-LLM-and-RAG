I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the architecture and training of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for ecoacoustic representations, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
