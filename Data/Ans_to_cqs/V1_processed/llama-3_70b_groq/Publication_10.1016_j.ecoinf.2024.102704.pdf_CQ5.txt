The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a "targeted fish species dataset" that was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process. This suggests that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is related to fish species, but the exact name or type of dataset is not specified.
