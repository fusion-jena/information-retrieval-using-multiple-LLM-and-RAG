The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that the validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the CNN, but it does not specify how the training process was stopped or what criteria were used to determine convergence. 

It is common in machine learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or number of epochs to determine when training is complete. However, this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this case.
