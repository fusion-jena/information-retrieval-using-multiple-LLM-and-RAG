The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the experiments were run across a whole range of train-test set splits, namely 80-20, 60-40, 50-50, 40-60, and 20-80. This suggests that the authors attempted to evaluate the model's performance on different proportions of the dataset, which could help to some extent in ensuring generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the PlantVillage dataset has multiple images of the same leaf taken from different orientations, and the authors have mappings for 41,112 images out of 54,306 images. This could imply that the dataset has some level of diversity, which could also contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, it is not clear if the authors used techniques like data augmentation, regularization, or early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalizability. The context also mentions that the model's accuracy is reduced substantially when tested on a set of images taken under conditions different from the images used for training, which suggests that there may be limitations to the model's generalizability.

Overall, while the authors took some steps to evaluate the model's performance on different proportions of the dataset, it is not clear if they took other measures to ensure generalizability, and the results suggest that there may be limitations to the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
