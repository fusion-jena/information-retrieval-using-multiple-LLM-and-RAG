Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context only discusses the data collection and curation phases, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, such as MAE, MSE, and MARE. It also mentions that the evaluation is performed on a non-publicly available dataset, but it does not provide any information about the dataset's characteristics or how it was split for training and testing. Therefore, I don't know what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
