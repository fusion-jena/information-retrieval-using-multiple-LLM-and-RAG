The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are used to measure the accuracy of the model in classifying insect species at different taxonomic ranks. The average and standard deviation of these metrics are reported in Table 4 for the ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3 models validated with multitask learning and pre-trained weights. The F1-score, in particular, is highlighted as a key metric, with the study achieving high F1-scores ranging from 95.7% to 99.1% at higher taxonomic ranks.
