The provided context does not explicitly mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context discusses classification and regression trees (CARTs), random forests, and XGBoost, which are machine learning models, but not deep learning models. It also mentions ecological niche modeling, habitat use, and count data, but it does not provide information about the purpose of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
