I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on word embeddings, semantic analysis, and natural language processing, with mentions of Word2vec, CBOW, and BERT. There is no mention of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, which are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
