The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are queries that satisfy certain conditions, and selecting the most informative ones. It discusses the parameters used to control the complexity and accuracy of the redescriptions, but it does not mention training or validation loss.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
