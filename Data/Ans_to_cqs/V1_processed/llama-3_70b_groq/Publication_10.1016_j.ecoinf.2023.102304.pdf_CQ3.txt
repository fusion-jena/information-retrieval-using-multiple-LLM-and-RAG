I don't know. The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, ecology, and environmental research, with references to papers on topics like Google Earth Engine, aridity index, vegetation cover, and landcover change. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques.
