Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the data formats are likely to be CSV or similar tabular formats, given the mention of "68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic U.S. Census data" and the list of attributes provided in the context, such as HH_INCOME_, HH_10K, HH10TO15K, etc. These attributes suggest that the data is in a tabular format, possibly in CSV or similar formats. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats in the context.
