I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the use of TensorFlow for automated species identification of Triatominae, the vectors of Chagas disease, and the configuration of TensorFlow for the project. It discusses the adjustment of parameters such as validation percentage and number of training steps, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
