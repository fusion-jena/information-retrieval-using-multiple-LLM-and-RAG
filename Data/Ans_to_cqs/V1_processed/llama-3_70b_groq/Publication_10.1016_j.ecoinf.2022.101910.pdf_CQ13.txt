I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that BirdNET uses a deep neural network for automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, and that three settings can be adjusted in BirdNET: the detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and the minimum confidence threshold. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
