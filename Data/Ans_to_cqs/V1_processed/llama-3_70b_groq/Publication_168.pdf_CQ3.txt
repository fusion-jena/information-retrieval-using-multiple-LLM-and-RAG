I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks. It discusses various architectures and techniques used for HSI classification, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
