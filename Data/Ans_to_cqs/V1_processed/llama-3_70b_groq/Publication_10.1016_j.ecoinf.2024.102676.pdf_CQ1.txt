Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method utilized in the deep learning pipeline is through citizen science data collection of footprints. This is mentioned in the text as "community involvement through citizen science data collection of footprints". This suggests that the raw data is collected through a collaborative effort between experts and the general public, where citizens contribute to the collection of footprint data.

Additionally, the context also mentions "professional tracking" as a method of data collection, which implies that experts may also be involved in collecting footprint data. However, it does not specify whether this is done through surveys, sensors, or other means.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions a "North-American Animal Tracks Database" which could be a public dataset used for collecting raw data. However, it is not explicitly stated how this dataset is used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline appear to be citizen science data collection of footprints and professional tracking, with a possible use of public datasets such as the North-American Animal Tracks Database.
