The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context appears to be discussing clustering methods for determining freshness classes of species based on six body parts parameters, and evaluating the clustering results using internal methods such as Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz. There is no mention of deep learning models or data splitting for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
