The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique to enhance sample variation. Data augmentation involves applying transformations to the existing data to generate new samples, which can help improve the model's robustness and generalizability. In this case, the data augmentation techniques used include rotation, reflectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of an ensemble of three models, which can also help improve the generalizability of the model. The ensemble approach involves training multiple models and combining their outputs, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's performance on unseen data. 

However, it is not clear from the provided context whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
