Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the model training, data preprocessing, and the performance of the model on the test data. It discusses the selection of the input window size, the effect of training sample size on performance, and the evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and average precision. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
