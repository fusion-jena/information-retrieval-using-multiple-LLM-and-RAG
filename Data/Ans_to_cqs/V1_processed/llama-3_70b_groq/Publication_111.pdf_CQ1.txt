Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the dataset used is from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
