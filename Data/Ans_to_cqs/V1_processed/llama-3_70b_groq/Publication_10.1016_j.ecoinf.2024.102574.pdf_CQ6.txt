Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, ecology, and environmental studies, with references to various machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

In general, preprocessing steps are crucial in deep learning and may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature engineering, and data augmentation, among others. These steps help prepare the data for training, improve model performance, and prevent issues like feature dominance or outliers. However, without specific information from the provided context, it is impossible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved.

If you need information on preprocessing steps, I recommend consulting general resources on deep learning or machine learning, such as tutorials, blogs, or textbooks. These resources can provide more comprehensive and detailed information on preprocessing techniques and best practices.
