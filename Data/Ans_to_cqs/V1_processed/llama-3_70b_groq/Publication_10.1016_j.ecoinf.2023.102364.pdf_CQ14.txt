The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses various machine learning models and techniques, such as RandomForest and MARS regression splines, but does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
