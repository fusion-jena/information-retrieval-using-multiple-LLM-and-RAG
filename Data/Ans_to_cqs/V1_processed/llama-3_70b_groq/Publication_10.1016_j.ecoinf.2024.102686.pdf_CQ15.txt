Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), but it does not provide information about optimization techniques used in deep learning.

The context does mention the learning rate (Î·(t)) in the SOM algorithm, which is a hyperparameter that controls how quickly the model learns from the data. However, it does not provide information about optimization techniques used to update the model parameters.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
