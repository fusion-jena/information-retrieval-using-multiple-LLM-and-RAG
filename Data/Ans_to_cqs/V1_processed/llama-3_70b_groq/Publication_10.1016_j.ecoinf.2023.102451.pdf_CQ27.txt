I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the dataset description, model configuration, and performance comparison with other deep learning models. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
