Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on explaining various neural network models, algorithms, and their applications in different domains like object recognition, speech recognition, and image classification. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used to prepare data for training these models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
