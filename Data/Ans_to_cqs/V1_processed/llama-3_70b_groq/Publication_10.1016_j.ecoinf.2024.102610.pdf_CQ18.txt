The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the termination condition in the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) technique. This suggests that RMSE might be used to evaluate the model's performance during training, but it is not explicitly stated as the strategy to monitor model performance.

It is also worth noting that the context provides information about the techniques used for variable elimination, such as RFE and VSURF, but it does not provide a clear answer to the query about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
