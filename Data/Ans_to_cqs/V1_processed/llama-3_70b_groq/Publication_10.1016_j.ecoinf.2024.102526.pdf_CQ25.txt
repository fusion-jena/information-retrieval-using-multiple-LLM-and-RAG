Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of artificial intelligence in detecting and identifying organisms in marine imagery, but it does not specify the exact purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely used for identification or classification of organisms in marine imagery, as it mentions "detect and identify/classify organisms" and "bias into the identifications". But without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
