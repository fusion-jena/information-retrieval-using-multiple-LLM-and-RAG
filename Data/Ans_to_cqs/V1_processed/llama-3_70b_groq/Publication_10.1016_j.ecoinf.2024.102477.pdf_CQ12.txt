The deep learning models used in the pipeline are RNN-based models, specifically SLSTM and SGRU models. SLSTM is an extension of the LSTM model that can forecast seasonal time-series data, and SGRU is another type of RNN model used for time-series prediction. There is no mention of CNN or Transformer models in the provided context.
