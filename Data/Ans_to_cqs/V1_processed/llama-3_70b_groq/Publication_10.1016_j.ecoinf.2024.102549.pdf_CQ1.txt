Based on the provided context, it appears that remote sensing is used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. This is inferred from the mention of "band reflectance of water quality monitorings" in Fig. 3, which suggests that satellite or aerial imagery is being used to collect data on water quality. Additionally, the review of carbon monitoring in wet carbon systems using remote sensing (Campbell et al., 2022) further supports this conclusion. 

However, it is not explicitly stated what specific methods are used for collecting raw data. It is possible that other methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets may also be used, but this is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to this question based on the available information.
