The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the Bat Detective dataset, which involves annotating audio clips for bat calls, but it does not specify the annotation techniques used. The context mentions "annotations" and "semantic segmentation" in the references, but it does not provide enough information to determine the specific annotation techniques used in the pipeline.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the annotations are related to identifying and labeling bat calls in audio clips. The top user's annotations are mentioned to have high quality, and their accuracy is measured in terms of average precision. This suggests that the annotations might involve some form of classification or detection task, but the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
