Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the neural network models, such as spectral normalization, LeakyReLU activation, and dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition. It also discusses the evaluation metrics used for classification, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, Top-1 error, and Top-5 error. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
