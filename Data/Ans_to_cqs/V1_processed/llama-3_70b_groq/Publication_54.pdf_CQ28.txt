The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text only discusses the development and testing of the model using various deep learning backbone models such as Inception-ResNet-v2, Inception-v3, Xception, ResNet101, and MobileNetV2, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
