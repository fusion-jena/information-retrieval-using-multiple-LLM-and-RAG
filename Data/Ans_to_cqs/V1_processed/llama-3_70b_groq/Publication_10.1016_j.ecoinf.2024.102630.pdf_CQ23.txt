I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data and its application in ecological informatics, including the calculation of mean NDVI values for different time periods and the analysis of forest, grassland, cropland, and orchard areas. There is no mention of a deep learning model or any techniques used to ensure its generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
