The provided context does not mention any traditional data augmentation techniques commonly used in computer vision tasks, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Instead, the context discusses a feature augmentation process that involves including lagged features in the dataset. This is a technique commonly used in time series analysis, where the model is provided with information about previous days to improve its forecasting capabilities. Specifically, the context states that "for each observation, the input features of the 1 to 5 previous days were added, which means that each row of the dataset contains the information of the same day as well as the information of the five previous days." This technique is used to provide the model with a more comprehensive understanding of the temporal relationships in the data.
