The hyperparameters of the Random Forest model are optimized using a combination of random search and grid search. Initially, a random search is performed to identify an optimal parameter set, where 100 sets are sampled and compared using three-fold cross-validation. The search parameter ranges are specified as follows: number of trees (200 to 800, by 100), minimum samples split (2-4), minimum samples per leaf (2-4), maximum depth (full), bootstrap (true), and maximum features for split (square root of the number of features). The results from the random search are then refined using a grid-search with the parameter ranges set to ±50 for the number of estimators and ±1 for the other parameters.
