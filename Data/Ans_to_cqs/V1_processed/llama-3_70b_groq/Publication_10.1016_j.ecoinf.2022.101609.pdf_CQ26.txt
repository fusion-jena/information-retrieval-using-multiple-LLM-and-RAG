The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions three key data pre-processors from fastai: categorify, fillMissing, and normalize. These pre-processors are used to map categorical columns to distinct categories, replace null values with column median values, and normalize continuous columns. There is no mention of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
