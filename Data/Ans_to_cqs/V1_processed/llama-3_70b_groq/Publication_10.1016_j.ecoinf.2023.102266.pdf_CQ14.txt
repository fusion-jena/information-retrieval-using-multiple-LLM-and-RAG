The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the model's properties, comparisons with the Von Neumann model, and potential future research directions, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
