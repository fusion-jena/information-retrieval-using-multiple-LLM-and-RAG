I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, dropout, or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing a land use model called PLUS, which uses a random forest algorithm and a cellular automata model to predict land use changes. There is no mention of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
