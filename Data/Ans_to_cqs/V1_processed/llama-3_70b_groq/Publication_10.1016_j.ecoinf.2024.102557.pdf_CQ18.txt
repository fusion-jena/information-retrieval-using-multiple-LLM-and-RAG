The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is environmental cross-validation with ten folds, which is used to tune the model hyperparameters and reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions. This is achieved through Bayesian optimization, as implemented in the R package "mlr3mbo".
