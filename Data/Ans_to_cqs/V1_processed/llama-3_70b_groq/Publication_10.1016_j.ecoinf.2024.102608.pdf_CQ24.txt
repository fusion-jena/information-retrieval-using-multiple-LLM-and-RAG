The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on randomized grid search methods for hyperparameter tuning and the application of random forest algorithms in ensemble learning. 

However, it can be inferred that the use of randomized grid search methods is a strategy to handle the randomness in hyperparameter tuning. This approach helps reduce the computational cost and time required for exhaustive grid search, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters. 

Beyond this, the context does not provide information on specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting random seed values. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
