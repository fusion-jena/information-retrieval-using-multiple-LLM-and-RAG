I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing a method for generating redescriptions, which are pairs of queries with similar supports, and selecting individual redescriptions for further analysis. The method involves setting parameters, such as thresholds on the size of the support and the complexity of the queries, and using measures like the Jaccard coefficient to evaluate the accuracy of the redescriptions. There is no mention of deep learning models, diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
