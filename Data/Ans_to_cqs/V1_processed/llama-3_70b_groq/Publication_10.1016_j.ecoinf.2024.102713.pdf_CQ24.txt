I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to a system called CASE, which is used for data collection and processing, and involves tasks, questions, and answers, as well as integration with satellite images and weather data. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
