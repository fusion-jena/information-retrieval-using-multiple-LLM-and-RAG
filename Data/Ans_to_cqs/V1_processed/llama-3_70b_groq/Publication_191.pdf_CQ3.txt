Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the limitations of existing plant datasets, the performance of various CNN models, and feature visualization techniques. It does not provide information on the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "crowdsourced dense image annotations" in reference [54], which suggests that some form of annotation is involved in the Visual Genome dataset. Nevertheless, the specific techniques used are not elaborated upon.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
