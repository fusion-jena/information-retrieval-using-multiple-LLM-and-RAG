Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the network, the loss functions used, and the quantitative comparisons of the model with other methods on different datasets. It does not provide information about the data splitting process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
