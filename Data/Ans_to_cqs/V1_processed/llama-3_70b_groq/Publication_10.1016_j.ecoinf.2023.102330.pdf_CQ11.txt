I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methodology and models used, including the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link as an answer to this query.
