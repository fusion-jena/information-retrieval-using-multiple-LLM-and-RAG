The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the architecture of the U-Net-like CNN, including the number of layers, depth, layer rate, batch normalization, residual connections, and dropout rate. It does not provide information about the training process, including the learning rate and optimizer used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
