Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, and others. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, data preprocessing, and experimental results. It discusses the use of the DeepLabV3+ model, data augmentation techniques, and the cropping size of images, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
