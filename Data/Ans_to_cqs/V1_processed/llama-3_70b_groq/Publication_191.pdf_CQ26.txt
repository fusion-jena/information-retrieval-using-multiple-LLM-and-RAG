The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the limitations of existing plant datasets, the architecture of a CNN model, and the visualization of feature maps. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the given context.
