The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is k-fold cross-validation. This approach is used to fine-tune hyperparameters in data-driven models. The development dataset is divided into k groups, and during each iteration, one group is used as the tuning dataset, while the remaining groups are used as the training dataset. The model is developed using the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated using the tuning dataset. The average performance of the k models developed on the validation groups represents the performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyperparameters.
