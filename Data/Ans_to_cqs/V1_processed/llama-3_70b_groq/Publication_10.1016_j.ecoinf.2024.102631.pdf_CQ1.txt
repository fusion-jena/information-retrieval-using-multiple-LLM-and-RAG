Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the model, as well as comparisons with other methods on various datasets (C-60, U45, and UCCS). It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. The context assumes that the raw data is already available and does not discuss the data collection process.
