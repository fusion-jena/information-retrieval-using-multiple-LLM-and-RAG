Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on river and stream ecosystem health assessment, machine learning, and deep learning models, but it does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, based on general knowledge, common methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline include:

* Surveys: Collecting data through questionnaires, interviews, or observations.
* Sensors: Using sensors to collect data on environmental parameters such as temperature, pH, or water quality.
* Public datasets: Utilizing existing datasets available in the public domain, such as government datasets or open-source datasets.
* Remote sensing: Collecting data through satellite or aerial imagery.
* IoT devices: Collecting data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as cameras, microphones, or other sensors.

It is essential to note that the specific data collection methods used may vary depending on the application, research question, and study area.
