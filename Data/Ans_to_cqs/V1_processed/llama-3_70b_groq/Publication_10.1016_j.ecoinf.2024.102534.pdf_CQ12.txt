I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It discusses the ensemble model, species distribution model, and climate change, but it does not provide information about the deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
