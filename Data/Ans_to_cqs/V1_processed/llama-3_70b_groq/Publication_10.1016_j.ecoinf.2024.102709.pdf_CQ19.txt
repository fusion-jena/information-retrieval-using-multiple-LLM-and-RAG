The context does not explicitly mention the deep learning framework used to build the model. It only mentions the use of the Python library scikit-learn for splitting the data and investigating the results of each trained model. It also mentions YOLO, which is an object detection algorithm, but it does not specify the underlying framework used to implement YOLO. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the framework used to build the deep learning model from the provided context.
