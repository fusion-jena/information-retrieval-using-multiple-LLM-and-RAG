The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam. The context appears to be discussing a classification problem using traditional machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). The hyperparameter tuning is performed using a grid search, but there is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques like SGD, Adam. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
