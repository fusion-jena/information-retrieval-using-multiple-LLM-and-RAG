The measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model are mentioned in the context. According to the text, the data were split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set totally independent of the two previous ones. Four of the five areas were used for learning and validation, and the last, isolated scene was used as the test set. This test set contained all the classes for the two nomenclatures, the five LC classes, and the 12 LU classes, and represented the New Caledonian landscape with various environments. This approach is similar to stratified splitting, where the test set is designed to be representative of the overall population.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or diverse dataset in the provided context. It can be inferred that the use of a separate test set and the inclusion of various environments in the test set might help in ensuring generalizability, but the exact measures taken are not clearly stated.
