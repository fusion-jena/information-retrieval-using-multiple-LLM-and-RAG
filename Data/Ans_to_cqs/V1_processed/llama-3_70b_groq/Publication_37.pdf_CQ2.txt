The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. This is evident from the context, which mentions "audio deformations" and "audio signal" in the data augmentation process. Additionally, the paper cites a reference related to "environmental sound classification" and "music audio feature learning", further supporting the conclusion that the data format is audio.
