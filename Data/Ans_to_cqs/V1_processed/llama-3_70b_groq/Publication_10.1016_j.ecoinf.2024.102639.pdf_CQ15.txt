The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on traditional machine learning methods, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as well as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithms. 

The only optimization technique mentioned is grid search, which is used to calibrate hyperparameters for the SVM model. However, this is not a deep learning-specific optimization technique. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
