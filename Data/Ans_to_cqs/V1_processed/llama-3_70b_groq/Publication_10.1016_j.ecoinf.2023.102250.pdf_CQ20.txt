I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses various aspects of the model, such as its architecture, activation functions, and performance on different datasets, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
