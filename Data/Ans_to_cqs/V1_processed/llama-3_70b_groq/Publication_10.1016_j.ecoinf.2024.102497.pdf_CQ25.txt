The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the context, it appears that the model is being used for regression tasks, specifically for bathymetry retrieval. The models mentioned, such as CART and RFR, are regression models used to predict continuous values, in this case, water depth. The goal is to estimate bathymetry from remote sensing data, such as GF-6 imagery. Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model is regression, specifically to predict water depth values.
