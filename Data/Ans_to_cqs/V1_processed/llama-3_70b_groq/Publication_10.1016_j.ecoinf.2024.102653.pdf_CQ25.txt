The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the model is likely used for classification. The context mentions the use of performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and confusion matrices, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Additionally, the model is trained to classify flight activity recordings, which suggests that the model is intended to classify or categorize the recordings into different categories. However, without more explicit information, the exact purpose of the model cannot be determined with certainty.
