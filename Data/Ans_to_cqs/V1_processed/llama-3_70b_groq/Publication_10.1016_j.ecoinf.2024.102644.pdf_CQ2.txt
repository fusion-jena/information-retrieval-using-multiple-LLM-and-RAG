The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that species observation data is obtained from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF) and that the data is improved with reliable records directly observed in the field. Additionally, it mentions that the data is pre-processed and split into 17 datasets, but it does not specify the format of these datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
