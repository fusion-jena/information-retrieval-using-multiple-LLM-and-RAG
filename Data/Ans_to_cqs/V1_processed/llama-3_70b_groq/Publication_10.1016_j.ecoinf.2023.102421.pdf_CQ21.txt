The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that the best model (with the smallest RMSE) is selected to estimate AGB for the entire study area, and this model was also interpreted to understand better what operates inside the 'black box.' This suggests that some form of model explainability or interpretation is performed, but the specific techniques used are not mentioned.

It is possible that techniques such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix may be used for model explainability, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
