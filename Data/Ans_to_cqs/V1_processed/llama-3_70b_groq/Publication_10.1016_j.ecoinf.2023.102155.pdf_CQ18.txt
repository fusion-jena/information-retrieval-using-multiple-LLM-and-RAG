I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be discussing the importance of sample size in model performance, data biases, and the performance of different models (such as Maxent) with varying sample sizes. It also presents some results of experiments with different models and bias correction methods, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
