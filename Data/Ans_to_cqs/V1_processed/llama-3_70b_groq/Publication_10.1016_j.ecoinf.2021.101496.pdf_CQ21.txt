The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training and validation process, including the comparison of different models (LM, GLM, and ANN) for SPAD value prediction.

However, it can be inferred that some metrics calculation was performed, as the context mentions the calculation of mean deviance, mean absolute difference, R-squared, and p-values for the different models. Additionally, the context mentions the analysis of model residuals for the ANN approach. 

But, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if these postprocessing steps were involved or not.
