The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data standardization, which is a preprocessing step used to transform variables to a similar numerical range, preserving distance relations between individual data. The formula for standardization is provided, but it does not address data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are common techniques used to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the answer to this query is that the provided context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
