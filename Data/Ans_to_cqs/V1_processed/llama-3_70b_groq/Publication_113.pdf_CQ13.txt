The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that "well-known values of hyperparameters" were used to train the models, but it does not provide further details. Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
