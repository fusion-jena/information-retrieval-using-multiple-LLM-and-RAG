The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the process of creating a comprehensive training dataset, using SHAP values to identify the most salient predictor, and hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. 

It is worth noting that the context does mention the model's performance on the training and validation datasets, with a training accuracy of 1.0 and a validation accuracy of 0.924. This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated, but the specific strategy used to monitor the performance during training is not described.
