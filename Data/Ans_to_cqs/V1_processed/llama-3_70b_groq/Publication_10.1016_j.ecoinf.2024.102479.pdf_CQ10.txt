I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article that discusses various machine learning algorithms and their applications, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository. The references cited in the context are mostly academic papers and books, and there is no mention of a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as an answer to this query.
