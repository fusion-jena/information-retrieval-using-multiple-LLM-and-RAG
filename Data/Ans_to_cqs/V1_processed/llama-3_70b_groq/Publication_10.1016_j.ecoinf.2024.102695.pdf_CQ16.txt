The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of an "early stopping strategy" in the training process. This suggests that the training process is stopped before the last epoch, likely when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving or reaches a plateau. However, the specific criteria used to determine this stopping point, such as a specific threshold for validation loss or a certain number of epochs with no improvement, are not specified.
