I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for biodiversity assessment, but it does not provide information about the availability of the code used in the study. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
