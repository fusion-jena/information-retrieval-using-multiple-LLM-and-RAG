The context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that Python and fastai were used for developing the deep learning CNN. Fastai is a high-level library that provides an interface to PyTorch, but it does not necessarily mean that PyTorch was used as the underlying framework. Therefore, I don't know the specific framework used to build the deep learning model.
