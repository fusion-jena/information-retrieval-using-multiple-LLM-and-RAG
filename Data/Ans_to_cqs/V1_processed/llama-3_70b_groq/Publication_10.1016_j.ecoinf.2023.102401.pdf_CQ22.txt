The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, F1 score, PR curve, and average mean accuracy. Additionally, the mean average precision (mAp) is also used, which is the average AP of all n categories, measuring the effect of accuracy and recall thoroughly. The F1 score is derived from precision (P) and recall (R) as follows: F1 = 2 × P × R / (P + R). Precision (P) is calculated as TP / (TP + FP), and recall (R) is calculated as TP / (TP + FN), where TP stands for true positive, FP stands for false-positive, TN stands for true negative, and FN stands for false-negative.
