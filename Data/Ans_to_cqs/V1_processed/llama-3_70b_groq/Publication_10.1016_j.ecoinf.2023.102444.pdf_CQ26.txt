The provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on dimensionality reduction methods (DRM) and their application in species distribution modeling. It discusses the use of UMAP, a non-linear DRM, to visualize and analyze bioclimatic variables. There is no mention of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
