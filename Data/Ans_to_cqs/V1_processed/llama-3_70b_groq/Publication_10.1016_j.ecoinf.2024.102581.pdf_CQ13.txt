The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

* Convolution Layers: The number of convolution layers is a hyperparameter, with a range of 1 to 10.
* Filters: The number of filters in each convolution layer is a hyperparameter, with a range of 1 to 64.
* Filter Size: The size of the filters in each convolution layer is a hyperparameter, with a range of 1 to 10.
* Number of Neurons: The number of neurons in each layer is a hyperparameter, with a range of 32 to 1024.
* Batch Size: The batch size is a hyperparameter, with a range of 8 to 512.
* Epochs: The number of epochs is a hyperparameter, with a range of 1 to 25.
* CNN Model Optimizer: The optimizer used is a hyperparameter, with options including ADAM, SGD, RMSProp, Adadelta, Adagrad, and Adamax.

Note that the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned as a hyperparameter in the provided context.
