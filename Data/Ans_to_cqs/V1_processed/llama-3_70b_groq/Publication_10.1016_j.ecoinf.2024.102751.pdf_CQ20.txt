I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text only mentions the possibility of using machine learning or deep neural networks for estimating soil moisture in the future, but it does not provide information about the actual implementation or the hardware resources used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
