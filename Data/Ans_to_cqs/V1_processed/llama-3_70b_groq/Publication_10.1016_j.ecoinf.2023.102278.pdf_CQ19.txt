I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and training of the models, including the use of transfer learning and pre-trained weights from ImageNet, but it does not specify the framework used to implement the models. It could be TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework, but the context does not provide enough information to determine this.
