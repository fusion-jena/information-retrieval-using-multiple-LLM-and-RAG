Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data, specifically underwater stereo images of fish. The context mentions the use of computer vision and deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation, fish detection, and species classification. There is no explicit mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of underwater video imagery in some studies, but it is not clear if these videos are used as input to the deep learning pipeline or if they are used for other purposes. Additionally, there is no mention of CSV files being used to store or process data.

In summary, based on the provided context, it appears that image data is the primary format used in the deep learning pipeline, but it is unclear if other formats like audio, video, or CSV are used.
