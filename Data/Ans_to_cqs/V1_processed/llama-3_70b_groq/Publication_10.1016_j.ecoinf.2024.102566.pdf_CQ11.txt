I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The text appears to be a research article discussing forest biomass density in the Qinba Mountains, and it references various studies and datasets related to forest biomass and carbon storage. However, it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
