The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the MLP ANN model uses a backpropagation learning algorithm during the training phase, and that the primary model tuning parameters are defined by "size" and "decay". 

It is likely that "size" refers to the number of neurons in the hidden layer, which is set to 6 in this case, and "decay" refers to the weighted decay, which is used to counter the effects of model overfitting. However, the learning rate and optimizer used in the model are not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer, as this information is not provided in the context.
