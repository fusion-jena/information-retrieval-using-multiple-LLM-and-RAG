Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water using various machine learning and deep learning methods.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention some limitations and challenges associated with deep learning methods, such as overfitting, especially when the available data is limited or noisy. It also mentions that deep learning methods can be less interpretable, making understanding the underlying decision-making process challenging.

While the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it implies that handling randomness and ensuring reproducibility are important considerations in deep learning pipelines. In general, setting a random seed value is a common strategy to ensure reproducibility in deep learning experiments. Other strategies may include using techniques such as data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble methods to reduce overfitting and improve model generalizability.
