I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper discussing the estimation of forest biomass density in the Qinba Mountains using remote sensing imagery and forest inventory data. The paper mentions the use of machine learning methods, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
