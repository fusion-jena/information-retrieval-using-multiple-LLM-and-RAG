I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context primarily focuses on the importance of reducing memory access to improve model performance, the impact of model architecture on memory access, and the effects of scaling models on their performance and computational requirements. It does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
