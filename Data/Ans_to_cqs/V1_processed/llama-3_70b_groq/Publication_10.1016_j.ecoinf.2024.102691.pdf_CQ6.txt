Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation techniques were employed to increase the number of training samples and improve model generalization ability. The specific techniques mentioned include scaling, panning, rotation, color transformation, and mosaic. However, it does not explicitly mention other preprocessing steps such as normalization or cleaning.

It is possible that these steps may have been performed, but they are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether normalization, scaling, or cleaning were part of the preprocessing steps before training the deep learning model.
