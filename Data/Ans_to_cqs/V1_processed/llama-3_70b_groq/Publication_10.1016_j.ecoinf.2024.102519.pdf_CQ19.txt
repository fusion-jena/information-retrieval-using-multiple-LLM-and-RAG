I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that deep learning has achieved great success in both theoretical and practical applications, but it does not provide information about the implementation details of the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model.
