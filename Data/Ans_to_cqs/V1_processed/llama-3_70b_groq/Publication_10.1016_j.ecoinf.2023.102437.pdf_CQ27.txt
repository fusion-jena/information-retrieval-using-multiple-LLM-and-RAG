I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of machine learning models, including RNN and LSTM, for processing sequential data and time series forecasting. It also mentions the importance of preselection of predictors to reduce computation time and the risk of overfitting. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
