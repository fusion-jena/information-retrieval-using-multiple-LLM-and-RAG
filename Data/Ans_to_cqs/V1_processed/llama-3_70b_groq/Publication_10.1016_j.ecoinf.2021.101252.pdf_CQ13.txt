Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the AutoML procedure generates candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters selected at random from a prespecified range of values, but it does not provide the specific values or types of hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
