The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to automatically filter empty camera images. The model is trained to classify images as either empty or containing wildlife, allowing for the efficient removal of empty images from large datasets generated by camera traps. This is evident from the context, which mentions that the model can "automatically filter empty images" and that the study explores an adaptive deep learning method to achieve this goal. The model is not intended for segmentation or detection tasks, but rather for classification of images as either empty or non-empty.
