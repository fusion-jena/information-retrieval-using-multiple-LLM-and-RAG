I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily discusses the use of BirdNET, a deep neural network, for automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations, and its application in monitoring threatened species. It provides information on the settings used in BirdNET, such as detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold, but does not provide details on the training process or model performance monitoring.
