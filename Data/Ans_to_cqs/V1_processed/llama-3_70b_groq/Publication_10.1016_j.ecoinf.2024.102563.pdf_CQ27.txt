I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the processes involved in doing so, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to digital soil mapping, remote sensing, and land cover classification, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
