Based on the provided context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the evaluation of model performance based on the accuracy metric. Additionally, the training and validation accuracy, as well as the training and validation loss, are plotted against the number of epochs to monitor the model's performance during training. This is evident from the figures provided, such as Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, and Fig. 9, which show the training and validation accuracy and loss curves for different models. This approach allows for the monitoring of the model's performance during training and helps in identifying issues such as overfitting or underfitting.
