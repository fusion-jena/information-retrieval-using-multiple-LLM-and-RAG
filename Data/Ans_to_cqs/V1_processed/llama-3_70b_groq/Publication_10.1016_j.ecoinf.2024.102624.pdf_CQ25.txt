The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The text mentions that the authors classified all the input dataset combinations with each classifier (RF, SVM, MARS) and with two sets of classes (7C and 13C), resulting in 60 models. The goal is to identify plant populations using remote sensing, and the classification models are used to achieve this. The authors also mention that post-classification, generally segmentation, and filtering provide better maps with a lower rate of salt-and-pepper errors, but the primary purpose of the models is classification.
