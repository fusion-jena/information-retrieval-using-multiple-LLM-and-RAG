I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to bioclimate variables, biological factors, and geographical environment factors, and it provides a list of variables and their explanations. It also cites several research papers, but none of them mention hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
