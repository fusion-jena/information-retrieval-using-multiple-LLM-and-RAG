Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of classification accuracies using different image types (high-resolution RGB images, hyperspectral images, and multispectral images) and the challenges faced in classifying certain tree species due to limited training samples. It also presents a table comparing the field-surveyed and predicted tree species richness and a flowchart outlining the three main steps for tree species identification using deep learning approaches. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
