Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of XGBoost models for land use/land cover classification, forest type classification, and forest fire risk assessment using remote sensing data. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

However, it can be inferred that remote sensing data is used as input for the deep learning models, but the specific methods or sources of data collection are not mentioned. It is possible that the data was collected through satellite or aerial imagery, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I don't know the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
