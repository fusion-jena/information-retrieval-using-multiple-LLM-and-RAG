Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is focused on image classification, specifically for coral reef images captured by underwater drones. The context mentions image preprocessing, resizing, and feature extraction using handcrafted descriptors and D-CNN models, such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3. 

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely image data, specifically in the form of 3-channel RGB images (as mentioned in the context, the input size of AlexNet is 227 × 227 × 3). There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
