The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process was stopped after a certain number of epochs (iterations), which is a common practice in machine learning. The context mentions that the models were trained within 10 and 100 epochs.

Additionally, the context provides plots of training and validation accuracy (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), which suggests that the training process might have been stopped when the validation accuracy plateaued or reached a desired level. However, this is not explicitly stated, and the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
