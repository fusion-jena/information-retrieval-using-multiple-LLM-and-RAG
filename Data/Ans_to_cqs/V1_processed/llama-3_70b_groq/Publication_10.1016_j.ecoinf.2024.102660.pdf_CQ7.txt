The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer the split ratio from the text. The authors mention that among the 1764 image pairs, 1232 were used for training, 176 for validating the model accuracy during the training phase, and 356 for testing the performance of the trained network post-training. This implies that the data was split into approximately 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing. However, the specific criteria or methodology used to determine this split ratio are not provided.
