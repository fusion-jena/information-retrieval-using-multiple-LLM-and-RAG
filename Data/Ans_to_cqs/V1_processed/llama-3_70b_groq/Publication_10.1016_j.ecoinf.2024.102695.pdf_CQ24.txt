Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on various machine learning algorithms and their applications in predicting dissolved oxygen levels and water quality. 

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of techniques like Bayesian optimization, which can help in handling randomness to some extent. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a specific allocation strategy for dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, which can help in reducing data snooping bias and enhancing the generalizability of the model. 

But, specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value, are not mentioned in the provided context.
