The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on feature selection, data fusion, and classification models, but it does not provide information on how to deploy a trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
