The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the "correct identification rate" which is used to evaluate the model's performance. This suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify the species. 

It is likely that the correct identification rate is equivalent to the accuracy of the model, but this is not explicitly stated. The context does not mention other common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, we cannot conclude that these metrics are being used to evaluate the model's performance.
