I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context provides information about various research papers and studies that use deep learning for computer vision tasks, such as insect detection and classification, but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
