I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The text only discusses the methodology and results of the study, including the use of a convolutional neural network for land use and land cover classification, but it does not provide any details about the code implementation or its availability. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
