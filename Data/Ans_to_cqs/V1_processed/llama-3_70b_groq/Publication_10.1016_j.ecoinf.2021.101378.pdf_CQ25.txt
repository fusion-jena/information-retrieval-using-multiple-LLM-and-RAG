The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their purposes. It discusses machine learning methods, specifically random forest (RF) and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), and their applications in ecological studies, such as species distribution modeling and insect forest risk assessment. The context does not provide information about deep learning models or their purposes, so I don't know the answer to this query.
