I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a machine learning approach using Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) for identifying potential drivers of changes in growth across two herring populations. It discusses hyperparameter tuning, data splitting, and the use of various datasets, but it does not mention data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
