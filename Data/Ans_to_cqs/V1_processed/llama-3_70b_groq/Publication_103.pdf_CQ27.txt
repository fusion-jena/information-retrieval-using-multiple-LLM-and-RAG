Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experiments and results of the deep learning model, including the methodology used for transfer learning, the architecture of the modified GoogleNet model, and the training settings. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
