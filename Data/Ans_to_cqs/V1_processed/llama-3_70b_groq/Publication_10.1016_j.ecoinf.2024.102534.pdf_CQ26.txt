I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context appears to be related to a research article about the vulnerability of orchids to climate change and land cover change, and it discusses ensemble modeling, machine learning algorithms, and data curation, but it does not provide information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
