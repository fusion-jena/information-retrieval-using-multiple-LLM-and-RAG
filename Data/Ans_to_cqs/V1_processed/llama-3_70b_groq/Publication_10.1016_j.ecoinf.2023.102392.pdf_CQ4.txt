I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the application of deep learning models, specifically XGBoost, in assessing the impact of flooding on freshwater fish and detecting the dispersal of spotted butterfish, as well as land use/land cover classification and forest type categorization using remote sensing data. However, it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
