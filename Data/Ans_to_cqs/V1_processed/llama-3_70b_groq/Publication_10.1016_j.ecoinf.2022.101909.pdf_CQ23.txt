The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the high performance shown in the test subset is partially biased by the individuals' vocalizations that were recorded for both training and testing. To address this, the authors recommend reserving monitoring areas for the creation of validation and test sets, avoiding a link with the training data and allowing the generalization of the model to be correctly estimated. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of ensuring generalizability, but the specific measures taken are not detailed.
