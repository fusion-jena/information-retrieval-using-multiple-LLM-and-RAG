The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setup, parameter settings, and comparison of MTMI-SMF with Random Forest for invasive species detection. It discusses the data splitting, parameter tuning, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
