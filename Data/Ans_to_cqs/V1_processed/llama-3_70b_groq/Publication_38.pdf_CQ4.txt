Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily consists of references to various research papers and articles related to deep learning, audio classification, and citizen science.

However, it is worth noting that one of the references, Salamon and Bello (2016), mentions "data augmentation" in the title, suggesting that the paper may discuss or utilize data augmentation techniques for environmental sound classification. Unfortunately, the context does not provide further details about the specific techniques used in that paper.

In general, data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations to the existing data. This can include techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, noise injection, and time stretching, among others. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine which techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
