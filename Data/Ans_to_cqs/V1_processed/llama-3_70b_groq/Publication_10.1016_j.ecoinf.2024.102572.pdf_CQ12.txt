I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments, but it does not specify the type of model used. It also discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for geospatial computations and data processing, but it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
