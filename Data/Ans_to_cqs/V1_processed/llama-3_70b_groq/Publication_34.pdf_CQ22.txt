The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Loss, Test Rmse, and Test A10%DQ. These metrics are calculated for each species and for two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites: a train set and a test set. The performance metrics are then averaged over the 50 species. The Mean Loss is an important metric because it is relevant to the ecological model and is the objective function that is minimized during model training. The Test Rmse and Test A10%DQ are also used to evaluate the model's performance.
