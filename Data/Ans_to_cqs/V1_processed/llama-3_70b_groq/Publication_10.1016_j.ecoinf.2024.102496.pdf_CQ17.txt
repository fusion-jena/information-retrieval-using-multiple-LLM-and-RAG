I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The text appears to be discussing a decision support tool for reducing nutrient pollution in urban watersheds, and it mentions concepts such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and machine learning. However, it does not provide any information about the specific regularization methods used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
