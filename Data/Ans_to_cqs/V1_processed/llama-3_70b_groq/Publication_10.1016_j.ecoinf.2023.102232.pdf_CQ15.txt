The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses the use of the Least Squares (LS) algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing the exploration of the parameters' space. It also mentions the combination of GA with other algorithms, such as LS, ARIMA, or artificial neural networks, but it does not provide any information about the use of deep learning or specific optimization techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
