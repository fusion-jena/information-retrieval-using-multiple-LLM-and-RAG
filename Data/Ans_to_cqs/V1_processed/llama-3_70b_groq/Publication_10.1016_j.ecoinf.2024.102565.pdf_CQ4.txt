I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses neural networks, their structure, and their application in tasks like classification and regression. It also mentions the use of k-fold cross-validation and random under-sampling to address imbalances in the dataset. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
