I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, being used in the pipeline. The text discusses a cellular automaton model, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning tools, but it does not specify a particular deep learning architecture. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
