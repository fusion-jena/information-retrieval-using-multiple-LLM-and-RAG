Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include image and audio formats. This is inferred from the mention of "recognition and classification of visual images" and "acoustic recordings" in the context. Specifically, the context mentions the use of data augmentation approaches for improving animal audio classification, which suggests that audio data is being used. Additionally, the mention of image recognition and classification implies the use of image data. However, there is no explicit mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.
