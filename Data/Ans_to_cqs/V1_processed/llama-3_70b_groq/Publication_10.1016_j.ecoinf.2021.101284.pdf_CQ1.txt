Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data is collected from various sources, including:

* GUS (likely a government statistics agency, possibly the Polish Central Statistical Office): provides data on the percentage of the population employed in industry (INDST) and access to medical assistance (DOC).
* OpenStreetMap: provides data on distance from land border crossings (BOR).
* Money.pl (a Polish financial news website): provides information on the degree of contribution of industrial or mining workplaces to the emergence of disease outbreaks.

It does not appear that surveys or sensors are used for collecting raw data in this pipeline. Instead, the data is sourced from existing datasets and online platforms. However, the exact methods of data collection are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
