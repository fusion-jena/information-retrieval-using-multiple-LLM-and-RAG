According to the provided context, the training is stopped when the validation ENS (EarthNetScore) repeatedly fails to improve compared to the score evaluated from previous epochs. This implies that the training is complete when the validation score plateaus, i.e., when there is no significant improvement in the validation score over a certain number of epochs.
