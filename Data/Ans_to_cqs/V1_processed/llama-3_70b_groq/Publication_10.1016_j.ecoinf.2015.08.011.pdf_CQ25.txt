The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but based on the provided information, it appears to be a regression task. The model is used to predict mosquito abundances, and the performance is evaluated using the mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data. This suggests that the model is trying to predict a continuous value, which is a typical characteristic of regression tasks.
