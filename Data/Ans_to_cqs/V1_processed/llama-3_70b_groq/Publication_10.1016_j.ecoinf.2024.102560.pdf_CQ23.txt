I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to environmental studies, discussing topics such as soil erosion, lake drying, and drought forecasting, but it does not provide information about a deep learning model or its evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
