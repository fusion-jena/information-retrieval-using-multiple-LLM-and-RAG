I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to an academic article discussing environmental flow, riparian ecosystems, and biodiversity maintenance, with equations and variables related to drought and ecological health. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
