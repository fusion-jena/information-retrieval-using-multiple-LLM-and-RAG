I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the architecture and performance of the Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN) and the baseline model, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
