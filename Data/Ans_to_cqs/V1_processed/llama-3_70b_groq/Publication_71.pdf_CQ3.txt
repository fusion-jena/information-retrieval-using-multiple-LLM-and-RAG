Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the DeepLabV3+ model. The context only provides information about the training parameters, model architecture, and the pre-trained model used for fine-tuning. It does not provide details about the data annotation process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
