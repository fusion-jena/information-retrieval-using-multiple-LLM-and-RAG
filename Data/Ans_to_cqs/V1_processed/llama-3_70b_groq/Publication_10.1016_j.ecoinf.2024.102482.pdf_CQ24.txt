Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on various applications of machine learning and deep learning in fields like ecology, biology, and environmental science. It discusses different techniques, models, and architectures, such as RNN encoder-decoder, LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM, but does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness.

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to employ strategies like fixing the random seed value, using techniques like dropout and batch normalization, and implementing regularization methods to mitigate the effects of randomness and ensure reproducibility of results. These strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, but they are general best practices in the field of deep learning.

In summary, the provided context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer.
