I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the parameters and techniques used in training the model, such as the learning rate, batch size, latent dimension, optimizer, and loss functions, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
