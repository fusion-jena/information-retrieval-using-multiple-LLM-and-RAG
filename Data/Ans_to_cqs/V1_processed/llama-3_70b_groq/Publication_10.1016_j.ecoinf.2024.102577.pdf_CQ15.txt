I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to fisheries, sustainability, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
