I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning methods in species distribution modeling, and it provides references to various research papers and techniques, but it does not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
