Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on explaining concepts related to deep learning, species distribution models, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It discusses topics like pooling layers, convolution operations, and kernel sizes, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
