Based on the provided context, I don't see any specific information about the post-processing steps involved after the model training. The context appears to be describing the architecture of a neural network model, including the encoder, decoder, and various blocks and layers. It also mentions the importance of the training data, paradigm, and model complexity in ecological soundscape analysis.

However, it does not provide information about the post-processing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. These steps are typically used to analyze and visualize the model's performance, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific post-processing steps involved after the model training based on the provided information.
