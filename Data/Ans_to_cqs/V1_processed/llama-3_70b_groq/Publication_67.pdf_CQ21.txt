Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the database construction phase, training phase, classification phase, and validation phase of the CNN-based model. It discusses the design of the datasets, the training of the Inception v.3 model, and the classification of new images, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, as this information is not provided in the given context.
