I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only mentions that the hyperparameters of the heterogeneous ensemble models were set to those optimized by the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm, but it does not provide the actual values or types of hyperparameters used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
