The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is the F1 score. This is mentioned in Table 4, which compares the average F1 score across different network architectures and dataset configurations. The F1 score is a measure of the model's accuracy on a specific task, and it is used to evaluate the performance of the models in this experiment. There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, or accuracy being used to evaluate the model's performance.
