The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of data augmentation techniques, such as randomly flipping and rotating images, to artificially create a larger training set. However, it does not mention specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
