The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). It only mentions that the available data is frequently split into a training data set and a test data set, but it does not provide the specific criteria or rules for this split.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, these details are not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data in this particular case, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
