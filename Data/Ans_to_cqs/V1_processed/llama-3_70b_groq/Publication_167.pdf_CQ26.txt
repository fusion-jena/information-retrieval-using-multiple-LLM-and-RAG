Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is a form of weighted sampling. The context states that "there are different numbers of samples of the five types of LU suitability samples in the training data, with a ratio of 7:14:1:5:7, there is an imbalance in the categorical data. In the training process, a relatively large weight is generated for the categories that have fewer samples, and a small weight is generated for the categories that have more samples, which solves the problem of the performance of the model being poor for the categories that have small sample sizes." This implies that the model is assigning more importance to the categories with fewer samples during training, which is a common technique to address class imbalance issues. However, it does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias.
