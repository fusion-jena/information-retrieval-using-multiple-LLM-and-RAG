I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The context appears to be related to a study on wild birds in Japan, discussing the methodology of collecting videos from YouTube and citing various references related to ecology, statistics, and ornithology. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
