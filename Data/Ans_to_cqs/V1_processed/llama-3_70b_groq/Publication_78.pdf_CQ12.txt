The pipeline uses a type of deep learning model called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, it uses custom-built CNN models such as CoralNet, as well as pre-trained models like AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3. These models are used for feature extraction from images of coral reefs.
