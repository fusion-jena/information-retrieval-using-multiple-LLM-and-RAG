Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the Res_AUNet model, its components, and the results achieved on the WSGD test dataset. 

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained and evaluated on the WSGD dataset, which might be a diverse dataset for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. But, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques to ensure generalizability. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
