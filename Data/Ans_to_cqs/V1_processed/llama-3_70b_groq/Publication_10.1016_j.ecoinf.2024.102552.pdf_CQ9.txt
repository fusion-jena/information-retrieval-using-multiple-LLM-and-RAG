I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses the use of machine learning methods for classification, but it does not provide information about the availability of the pipeline or its repository. The context mentions supplementary materials, such as a time-lapse video of images over time, but it does not mention a specific repository where the pipeline can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
