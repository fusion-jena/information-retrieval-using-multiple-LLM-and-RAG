I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to spectral analysis and pre-processing, and mentions various techniques and algorithms such as random forest, convolutional neural network, and partial least-squares regression, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
