The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection and classification. The model is designed to identify and classify insects within images. This is evident from the mention of methods such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN, which are commonly used for object detection tasks. The model is trained to extract features from images and classify them into different species of insects. The evaluation metrics used, such as precision and recall, also suggest that the model is intended for object detection and classification tasks.
