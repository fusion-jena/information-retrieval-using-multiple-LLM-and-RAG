The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically 320 × 320 pixels images. This is evident from the context where it is mentioned that "The training set included 21 different individuals (classes) each having 4 different 320 × 320 pixels images." and "Images of both training and test sizes varied in their poses and other image characteristics, such as contrast, brightness, etc."
