I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training. The text discusses various aspects of a research study, including data analysis, uncertainty quantification, and potential improvements for mixed-methods analytical historical ecology. However, it does not provide information on the training process or model performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
