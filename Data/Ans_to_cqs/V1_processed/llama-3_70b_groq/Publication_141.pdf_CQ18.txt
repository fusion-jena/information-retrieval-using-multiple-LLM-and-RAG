The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the calculation of accuracy and misclassification rates on the training and validation sets. The context provides accuracy and misclassification rates for different models and datasets, indicating that these metrics are being used to evaluate the model's performance during training.
