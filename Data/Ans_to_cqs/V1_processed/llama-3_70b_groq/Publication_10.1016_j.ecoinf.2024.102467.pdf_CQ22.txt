The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are precision (P), recall (R), harmonic mean of P and R (F1), and mean average precision (mAP). These metrics are used to evaluate the model accuracy of the underwater aquaculture biometric recognition algorithm. The formulas for calculating these evaluation indicators are provided, which are: P = TP / (TP + FP) × 100%, R = TP / (TP + FN) × 100%, F1 = 2PR / (P + R), and mAP = (1/n) ∑n i=1 APi.
