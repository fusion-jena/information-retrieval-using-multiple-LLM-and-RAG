I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context provides information about various research papers and studies related to remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and deep learning, but it does not provide specific details about model deployment. It mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud processing platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis, but it does not provide information about model serialization or platform selection for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
