I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context only mentions that a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks was used to create the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) and to fuse GEDI data and Sentinel-2 images. It does not provide any information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
