Based on the provided context, it appears that the study involves analyzing a multifrequency acoustics dataset using Functional Data Analysis (FDA). The context provides various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R2, which suggest that the model training has been completed. However, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps involved after the model training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved in this study, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The provided context does not provide sufficient information to determine these steps.
