I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training, postprocessing steps, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to a study on carbon uptake by vegetation and ecosystem processes, and it discusses data collection and processing, as well as the use of a TPINet-based process network approach to identify causal links between variables. There is no mention of machine learning or model training, which is what the query is asking about. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
