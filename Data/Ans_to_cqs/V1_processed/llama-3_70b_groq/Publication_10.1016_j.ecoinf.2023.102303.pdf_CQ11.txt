I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the development of a novel fish dataset in turbid waters, weakly labeling the dataset, and creating two deep learning models to achieve different goals. It also provides information about the labeling time, training time, turnaround time, and accuracy of the models. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
