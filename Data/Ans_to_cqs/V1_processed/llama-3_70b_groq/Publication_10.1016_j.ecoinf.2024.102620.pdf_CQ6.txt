Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a model called PLUS, which is used for land use simulation, and it mentions various components of the model, such as the LEAS module and the CA model. It also compares the PLUS model with other models, such as the FLUS model and the BIOME-BGC model. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
