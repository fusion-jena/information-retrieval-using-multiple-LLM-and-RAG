Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the SeedNet model, the experiments conducted, and the results obtained, but it does not provide information on how the model's generalizability was ensured.

It can be inferred that the model was tested on two different datasets (Canadian and local), which might suggest that the model's performance was evaluated on diverse data. However, it is not clear if the datasets were split into training, validation, and testing sets, or if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the model's generalizability.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
