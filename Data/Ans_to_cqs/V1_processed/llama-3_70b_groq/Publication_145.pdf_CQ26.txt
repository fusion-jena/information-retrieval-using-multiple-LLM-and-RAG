Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions that data augmentation was applied randomly to the input images, including 0–360◦ rotations, horizontal and vertical flips, and changes in brightness, saturation, and hue. This suggests that the authors are using data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce the risk of overfitting to a specific orientation, brightness, or color profile.

However, it does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. It also does not explicitly mention diverse data collection, although the context does mention that the model is capable of achieving accuracy similar to human-level classification accuracy on large-scale datasets, which may imply that the dataset is diverse.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer is that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
