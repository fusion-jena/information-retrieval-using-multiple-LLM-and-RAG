Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, input variables, and comparison of training time, prediction time, and optimization time for different models (CNN and XGB). It also provides information on the hardware used for training and prediction. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps involved after model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
