I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the application of transformer models in computer vision, specifically the vision transformer (ViT) paradigm, and its variations. It also mentions CNN models and their applications in image classification tasks. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are an essential step in preparing data for training deep learning models.
