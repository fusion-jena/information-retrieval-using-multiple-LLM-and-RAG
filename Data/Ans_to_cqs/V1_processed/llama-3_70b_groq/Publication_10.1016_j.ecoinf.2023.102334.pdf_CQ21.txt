Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Metrics calculation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and other evaluation indicators. 

2. Confusion matrix calculation: A confusion matrix is used to quickly observe the performance of the model on each category and calculate the accuracy, precision, and other evaluation indicators of each category. The confusion matrix is normalized in the row direction, with 6 rows and 6 columns representing 6 categories, respectively.

No mention of saliency maps is found in the provided context. It is possible that saliency maps were not used in this particular work. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the acquired image data were randomly generated in an 8:2 ratio with the corresponding training and test sets, which were uniformly adjusted to a size of 224 Ã— 224 for network model training and accuracy testing, respectively. The training set was enlarged to avoid experimental overfitting using random cropping, vertical flipping, and horizontal flipping.
