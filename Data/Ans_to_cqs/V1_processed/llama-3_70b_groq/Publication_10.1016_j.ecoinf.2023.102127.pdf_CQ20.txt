The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training deep learning models, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text discusses the different engines and algorithms used for species distribution modeling, including Bayesian and frequentist approaches, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources required for training these models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
