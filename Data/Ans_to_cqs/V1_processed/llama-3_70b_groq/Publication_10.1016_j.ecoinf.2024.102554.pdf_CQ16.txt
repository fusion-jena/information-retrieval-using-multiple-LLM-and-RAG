I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau, which are terms typically used in machine learning. The context appears to be related to satellite remote sensing and data analysis, discussing topics such as data completeness, consistency, and coverage of different satellite products. There is no mention of training or model evaluation, which makes it impossible to determine the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
