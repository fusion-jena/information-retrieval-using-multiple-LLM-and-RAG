The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques used to expand the dataset, which can help mitigate data bias to some extent. The data augmentation techniques mentioned include:

* HSV adjustment
* Rotation
* Scaling
* Cropping
* Flipping
* Mosaicking

These techniques can help increase the diversity of the dataset, making it more representative of the real-world data. However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
