I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be discussing a study on YouTube videos related to wild birds, including data collection, video analysis, and examining the relationship between video factors and the number of views. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
