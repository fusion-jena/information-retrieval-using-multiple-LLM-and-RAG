The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of dropout with a probability of 0.5 in the last two layers of the CNN model, which is a regularization technique that can help reduce overfitting and introduce randomness in the model. Additionally, the use of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent for training the model also introduces some level of randomness. 

However, there is no mention of setting a specific random seed value to ensure reproducibility of the results. It is possible that the authors may have used a random seed value, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
