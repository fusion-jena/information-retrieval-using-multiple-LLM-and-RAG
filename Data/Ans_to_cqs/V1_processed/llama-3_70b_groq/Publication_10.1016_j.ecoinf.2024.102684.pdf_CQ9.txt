I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects of deep learning models in remote sensing, including model validation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter search, but it does not provide information about the availability of the pipeline or its data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
