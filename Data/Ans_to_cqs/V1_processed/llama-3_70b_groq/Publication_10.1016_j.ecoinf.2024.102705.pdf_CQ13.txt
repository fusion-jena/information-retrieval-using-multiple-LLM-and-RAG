The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate. However, it does mention several optimization algorithms that are commonly used to adjust the model's parameters during training. These optimization algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad), Root Mean Square Prop (RMSProp), and Adam. These algorithms are used to optimize the model's parameters to minimize the loss function, but the specific hyperparameters used (e.g., learning rate, batch size, etc.) are not specified.
