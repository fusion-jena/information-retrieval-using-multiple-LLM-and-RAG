I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or random seed values. The text appears to be discussing a mobile app called "Dive Reporter" that collects data on marine taxa from recreational SCUBA divers, and its potential for crowdsourcing biodiversity data. There is no mention of deep learning or any related concepts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
