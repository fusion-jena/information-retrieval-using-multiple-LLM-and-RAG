I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context appears to be discussing random forests, a type of machine learning model, and its properties, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
