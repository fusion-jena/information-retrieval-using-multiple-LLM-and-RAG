The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of transfer learning and active learning for sound event detection in soundscape data, particularly in the context of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) datasets. It discusses the evaluation of different embedding models and their performance on various datasets, but it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
