The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention a data augmentation method to train the two-stage CNNs as a generally applicable model under various camera or field conditions. This suggests that data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the model's robustness to different conditions. Additionally, the use of EfficientNet, which is a family of models that have been shown to perform well on various benchmark datasets, may also contribute to the model's generalizability. However, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.
