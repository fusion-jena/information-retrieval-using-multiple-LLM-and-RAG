Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning architectures, models, and techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, residual connections, and batch normalization. 

However, it is worth noting that batch normalization is mentioned in the context, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer, helping to improve the stability and speed of the training process. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) as an activation function, which adds nonlinearity to the model. 

While the context does not provide explicit information on optimization techniques, it does provide insights into other aspects of deep learning models and techniques. If you're looking for information on optimization techniques, you may need to consult additional resources.
