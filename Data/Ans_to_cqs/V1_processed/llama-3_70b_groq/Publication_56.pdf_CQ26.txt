Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on deep learning-based classification of hyperspectral data, remote sensing, and various applications of deep learning in related fields. It also touches on interpretability methods for deep learning models, such as model decomposition, sensitivity analysis, and feature visualization. However, it does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
