Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the description of the machine-learning algorithms used, such as AlexNet, boosting-based classifiers, and a linear discriminant model, as well as the assessment of their performance. It does mention that the dataset was split into training (80%) and testing sets (20%), but it does not provide information on how data bias was addressed during preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
