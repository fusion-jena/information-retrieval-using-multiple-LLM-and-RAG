I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of deep learning for soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) prediction, the development of the model, and the input features used, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
