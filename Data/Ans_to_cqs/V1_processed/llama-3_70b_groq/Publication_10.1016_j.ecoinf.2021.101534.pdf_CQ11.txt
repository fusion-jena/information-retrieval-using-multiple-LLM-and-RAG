The provided context does not explicitly mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a database that can be exchanged with other databases or web applications through APIs of the SILIC web service. But it does not seem to be the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
