The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on optimizing data structures for machine learning classification, hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics like OA and Cohen's Kappa statistic. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques, which are typically used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
