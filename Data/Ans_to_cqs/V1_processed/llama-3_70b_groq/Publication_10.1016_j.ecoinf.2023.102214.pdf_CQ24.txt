Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on image classification, detection algorithms, and individual ID methods for snow leopard datasets. It discusses the importance of data collection, labeling, and curation for deep learning research, as well as the comparison of AI-based individual ID with manual classification methods.

The context does mention model training and testing, including tuning the number of required epochs and inspecting model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
