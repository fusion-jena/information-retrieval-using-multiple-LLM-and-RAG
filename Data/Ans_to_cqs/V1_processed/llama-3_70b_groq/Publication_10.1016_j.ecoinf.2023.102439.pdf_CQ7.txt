The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context is a distribution of 60% for training and 40% for validation and testing. This is stated in the provided context as "This data partitioning resulted in a distribution of 60% for training and 40% for validation and testing." This means that 60% of the total data points (264) were used for training the model, and the remaining 40% (72 data points) were reserved for testing and validation purposes.
