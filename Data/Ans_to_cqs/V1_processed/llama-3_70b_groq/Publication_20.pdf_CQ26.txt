The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a deep learning model for fish species classification, including the dataset used, hyperparameters, and performance evaluation.

However, it can be inferred that the authors have attempted to mitigate data bias by collecting a large dataset with at least 2200 thumbnails per fish species class. This suggests that they have tried to ensure a relatively balanced dataset, which can help reduce bias. Additionally, the use of a dropout rate of 50% during training may also help prevent overfitting, which can be a consequence of biased data.

However, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these specific techniques were used in this study.
