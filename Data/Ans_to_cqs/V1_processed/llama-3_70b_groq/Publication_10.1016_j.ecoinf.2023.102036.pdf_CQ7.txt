Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the model training optimized parameters, the use of deep learning techniques, and the application of computer vision in the field of fisheries. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
