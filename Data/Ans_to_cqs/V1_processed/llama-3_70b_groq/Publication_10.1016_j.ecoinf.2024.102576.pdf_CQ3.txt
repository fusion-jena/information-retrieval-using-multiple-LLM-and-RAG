Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning models for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information, but it does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques employed.

The context mentions the importance of labeling data for training deep learning models, particularly the U-Net model, but it does not elaborate on the specific techniques used for data annotation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.

If more information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline is required, additional context or references may be necessary.
