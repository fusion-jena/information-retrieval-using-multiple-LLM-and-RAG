Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context only mentions that a training dataset was generated by selecting 500 survey images at random and then passed through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other measures to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
