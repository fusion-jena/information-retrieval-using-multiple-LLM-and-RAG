Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. The context mentions the use of acoustic data analyses, signal recognition software (Kaleidoscope Pro), and spectrograms (using Raven Pro) to analyze and characterize bird songs. Additionally, the paper by LeBien et al. (2020) is mentioned, which discusses the use of a convolutional neural network for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. This suggests that the deep learning pipeline is focused on audio data, specifically for species identification and classification.
