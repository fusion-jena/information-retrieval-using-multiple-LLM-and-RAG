The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on acoustic detection of covey calls using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was trained on covey call spectrogram data collected from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and Alabama, USA. There is no mention of traditional computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in image classification tasks.
