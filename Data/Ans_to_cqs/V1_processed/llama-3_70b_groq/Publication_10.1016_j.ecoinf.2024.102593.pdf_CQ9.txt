I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It provides information about various research papers, models, and techniques used in bioacoustics, but it does not specify where the data repository is located. The context mentions various sources such as arXiv, Sci. Rep., and TensorFlow Hub, but it does not provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
