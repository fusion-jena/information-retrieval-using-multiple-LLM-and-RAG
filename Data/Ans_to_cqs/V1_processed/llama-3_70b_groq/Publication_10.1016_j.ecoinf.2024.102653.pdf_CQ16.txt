The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the model training and hyperparameters, model validation, and performance metrics, but it does not specify the stopping criterion for training.

The context presents the hyperparameters used for training the Recurrent Neural Network model, including the number of epochs (100), but it does not mention how the training process is terminated. It is possible that the training is completed after a fixed number of epochs, but this is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the context does not mention validation loss plateau or any other criteria that might be used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the criteria used to decide when training is complete.
