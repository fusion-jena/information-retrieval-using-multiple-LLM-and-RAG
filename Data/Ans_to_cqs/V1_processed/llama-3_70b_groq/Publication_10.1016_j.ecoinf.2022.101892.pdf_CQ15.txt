Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text focuses on the architectures of different neural networks (ResNet, RepVGG, MobileNet-V3), data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
