Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the construction of training datasets, training of CNN models, classification, and validation phases, but it does not provide specific information about data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of image data from various sources, including Google, Maxar, and NWPU-RESISC45 dataset, and the creation of a global database of very high-resolution satellite and aerial RGB images. It also mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, but it does not provide further details on how the data was annotated.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer based on the provided context.
