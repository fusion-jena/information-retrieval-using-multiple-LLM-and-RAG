The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context only mentions that the study uses Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images and spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas for the entire study area. It does not mention any specific datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the specific dataset used in this study.
