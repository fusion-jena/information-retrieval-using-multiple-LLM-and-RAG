The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for wetland mapping, but it does not provide details on the data annotation methods employed. It mentions that the study uses "patch-level" learning, which suggests that the data may be annotated at the patch level, but the specific annotation techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) are not specified.
