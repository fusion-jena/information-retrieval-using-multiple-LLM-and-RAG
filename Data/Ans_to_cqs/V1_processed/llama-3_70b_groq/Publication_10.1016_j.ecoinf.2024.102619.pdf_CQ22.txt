The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Accuracy indicates the proportion of images that the model classifies correctly. Recall, or sensitivity, refers to the proportion of images of each class that were correctly classified. Precision determines the accuracy of the predictions themselves; it measures the proportion of images that were assigned a correct class when classified. The recall and precision for each class are calculated using the formulas: Recallc = TPc / (TPc + FNc) and Precisionc = TPc / (TPc + FPc), where TPc is the number of true positives, FNc is the number of false negatives, and FPc is the number of false positives.
