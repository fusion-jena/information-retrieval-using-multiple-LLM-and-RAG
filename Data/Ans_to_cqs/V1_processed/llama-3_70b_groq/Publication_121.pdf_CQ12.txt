The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 as base models, which are both variants of CNNs. Additionally, the context also compares the performance of the proposed models with other CNN-based approaches, further supporting the conclusion that CNNs are used in the pipeline.
