The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to estimate fish biomass in turbid environments. The model is trained on large datasets of fish images to provide accurate biomass estimates without causing unnecessary strain to the fish and minimizing manual effort. Additionally, the model can be used for fish species identification, classification, and detection. The incorporation of Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings can enhance the detection and classification of fish species within the dataset, capturing contextual and semantic information that improves the accuracy of fish biomass estimates.
