I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to NDVI reconstruction and vegetation cover study, but it does not include any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
