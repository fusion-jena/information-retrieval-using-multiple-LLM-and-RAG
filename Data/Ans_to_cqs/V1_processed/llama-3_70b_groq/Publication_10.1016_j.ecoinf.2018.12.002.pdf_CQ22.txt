The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention "classification accuracy" in the context of comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms. 

It is likely that other common metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. may also be used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. 

Therefore, I don't know the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model based on the provided context.
