Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the history and development of neural networks, deep learning, and their applications in various fields like ecology and economics. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention various machine learning and deep learning techniques, such as Bayesian learning machines, support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and genetic algorithms. These techniques often involve randomization or stochastic processes, which can be sensitive to random seed values.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves strategies like fixing random seeds, using techniques like dropout and batch normalization, and employing ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
