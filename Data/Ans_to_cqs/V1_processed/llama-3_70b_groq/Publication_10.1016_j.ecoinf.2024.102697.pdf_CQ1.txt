The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to remote sensing observations and land surface temperature, it can be inferred that remote sensing data might be used as a source of raw data. Additionally, the context mentions wastewater treatment plant influent and soil heat flux, which might involve the use of sensors or other monitoring systems to collect data.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context does not mention surveys or public datasets as sources of raw data, but it is possible that they might be used in certain applications.

In summary, while the context provides some hints about the potential sources of raw data, it does not provide a clear answer to the question. Therefore, I don't know the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
