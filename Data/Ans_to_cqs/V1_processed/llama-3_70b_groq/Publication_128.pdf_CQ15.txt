The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text only mentions the learning rate and dropout rate, which are set to 0.001, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
