I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model optimization or hyperparameter tuning. The text appears to be discussing the use of different indices (such as Rao's Q, CV, Shannon's H, and Simpson's D) to assess heterogeneity in LiDAR data, and comparing the results of using different GEDI CHM models (Lang10m and Potapov30m). There is no mention of model optimization or hyperparameter tuning, so I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
