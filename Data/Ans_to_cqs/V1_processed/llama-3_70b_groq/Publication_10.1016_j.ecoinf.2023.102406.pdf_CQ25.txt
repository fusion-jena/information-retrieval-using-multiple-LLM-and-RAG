I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their purposes. The context discusses species distribution modeling, sample thinning, and modeling approaches such as general linear models, MaxEnt, and random forests. It also mentions classifier selection and model configuration, but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their specific purposes (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection). Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
