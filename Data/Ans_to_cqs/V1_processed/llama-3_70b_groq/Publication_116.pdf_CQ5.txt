The provided context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention ImageNet in reference [33], which suggests that ImageNet might be one of the datasets used. Additionally, the context discusses plant identification and herbarium specimens, which implies that the datasets used might be specific to plant classification tasks. Unfortunately, the context does not provide enough information to determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
