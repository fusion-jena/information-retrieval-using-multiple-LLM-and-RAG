Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, such as the learning policy, base learning rate, batch size, and other hyperparameters. It does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
