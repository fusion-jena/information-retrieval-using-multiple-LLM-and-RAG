I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where it can be found. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning methods for understanding rural landscapes, and it includes references to other research papers and publications. However, it does not provide any information about the availability of the code or its repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
