Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of pre-trained deep learning models, such as BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, for feature extraction and classification of acoustic signals. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that were performed before training these models.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, to prepare the data for training. These steps can help improve the model's performance and prevent issues like feature dominance or exploding gradients. But without specific information, I cannot provide the exact preprocessing steps involved in the training of the mentioned models.

In general, the preprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Therefore, I would need more information about the specific model and dataset to provide a more accurate answer.
