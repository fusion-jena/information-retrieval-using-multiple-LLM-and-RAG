Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be a collection of Unicode characters, which do not form a coherent text or provide any information related to machine learning or training completion criteria.

Typically, in machine learning, the criteria used to determine when training is complete may include:

* Validation loss plateau: When the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau, it may indicate that the model has converged, and training can be stopped.
* Convergence of model parameters: When the model parameters stop changing significantly, it may indicate that the model has converged, and training can be stopped.
* Maximum number of epochs: Training can be stopped after a fixed number of epochs, regardless of the model's performance.
* Early stopping: Training can be stopped when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.

However, without more context or information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this case.
