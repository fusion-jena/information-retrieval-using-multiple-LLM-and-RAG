The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithms, along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), for analyzing animal behavior in T-maze environments. 

However, it does mention the use of cross-validation to refine hyperparameters and ensure the model's generalization prowess. Cross-validation is a common technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, but it is not directly related to splitting data for training, testing, and validation.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular context.

Therefore, I don't know the exact answer to this query based on the provided context.
