The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. It appears to discuss species distribution modeling using various classifiers such as general linear models, MaxEnt, and random forests. 

However, it does mention that the testing data were 25% of samples, which were randomly sampled and split using the createDataPartition function in the caret package. This suggests that the model was evaluated using a separate testing dataset, which is a common practice to ensure the generalizability of a model. 

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset. Therefore, it is unclear what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model beyond the use of a separate testing dataset.
