The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "the early stopping procedure was used to avoid over-fitting" and "dropout" is mentioned as an operation in the architecture, but it does not specify that it is used as a regularization method.

Additionally, the context mentions that "the batch size was 32" and "data augmentation was applied to all extracted patches" which can also be considered as regularization techniques. But it does not mention L2 regularization or any other regularization methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only regularization method that can be confirmed is early stopping and data augmentation. Dropout is mentioned, but it is not clear if it is used as a regularization method.
