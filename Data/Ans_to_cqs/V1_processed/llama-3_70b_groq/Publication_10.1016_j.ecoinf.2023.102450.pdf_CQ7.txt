I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to animal tracking using a Siamese network and few-shot learning, but it does not provide information on data splitting for model training. The context includes details on the methodology, evaluation, and references, but it does not address the specific question of data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
