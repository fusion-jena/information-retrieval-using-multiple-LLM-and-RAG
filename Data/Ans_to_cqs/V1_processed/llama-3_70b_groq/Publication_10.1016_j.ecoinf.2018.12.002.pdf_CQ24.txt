The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses random forests, a type of ensemble learning algorithm, and its applications in ecological studies. It also briefly mentions other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, neural networks, CARTs, and linear discriminant analysis. 

However, it does not provide information on deep learning or how to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
