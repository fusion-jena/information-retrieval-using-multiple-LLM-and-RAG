I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses various topics such as coral reefs, ecological informatics, and synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
