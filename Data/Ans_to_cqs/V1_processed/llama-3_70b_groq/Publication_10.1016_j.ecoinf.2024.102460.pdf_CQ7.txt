I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily discusses various models and techniques used for land use change prediction, including LSTM, FMOP, Markov chain, and PLUS models, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
