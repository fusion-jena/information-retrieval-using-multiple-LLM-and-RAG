The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a type of Autoencoder, which is a variant of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The architecture consists of convolutional layers with max-pooling and max-unpooling layers, which are typical components of CNNs. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
