I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to be discussing species distribution models, sampling bias, and model evaluation, but it does not provide information about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
