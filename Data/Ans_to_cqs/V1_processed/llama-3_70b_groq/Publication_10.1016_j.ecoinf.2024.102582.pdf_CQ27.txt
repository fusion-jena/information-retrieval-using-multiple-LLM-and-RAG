I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the limitations and future studies of a research on mangrove species, and provides references to various studies on mangrove forests and remote sensing. The only mention of deep learning is in the reference to Lassalle et al. (2022), which discusses the use of deep learning for individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
