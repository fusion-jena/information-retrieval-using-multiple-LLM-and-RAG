The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context only mentions that the CNN hyperparameters configurations used for all four networks during training are shown in Table 1, but it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
