The platform used to deploy the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors "ran this architecture on Caﬀe" (Jia et al., 2014), which suggests that the model was deployed on a local machine or a server with Caﬀe installed, rather than a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform.
