Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be a list of references related to acoustic signal processing, deep learning, and bioacoustics, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include:

* Random splitting: dividing the data randomly into training, testing, and validation sets
* Stratified splitting: dividing the data into sets while maintaining the same class distribution
* Time-based splitting: dividing the data based on time, such as using older data for training and newer data for testing
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k folds and using each fold as a validation set

However, without specific information from the context, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used for data splitting in this particular case.
