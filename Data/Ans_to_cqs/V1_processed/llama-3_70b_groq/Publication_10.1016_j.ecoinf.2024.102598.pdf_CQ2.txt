Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on forest fire susceptibility prediction using machine and deep learning algorithms, and it discusses various models and their performance. However, it does not provide information about the data formats used in the pipeline.

Although the context mentions "remote sensing" and "integrating remote sensing and machine learning algorithms," it does not specify the format of the remote sensing data. It could be in the form of images, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
