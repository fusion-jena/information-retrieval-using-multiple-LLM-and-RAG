Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Random assignment of initial point labels (as seen in the "CoinF" method).
2. Use of different methods such as k-NN, k-means, and random CF Loop to handle randomness.
3. Application of lasso regularization to reduce the impact of randomness.
4. Bias correction to account for any biases introduced by randomness.

It is also worth noting that the context does not explicitly mention the use of random seed values, but it does suggest that the methods employed are designed to handle randomness and uncertainty in the data.
