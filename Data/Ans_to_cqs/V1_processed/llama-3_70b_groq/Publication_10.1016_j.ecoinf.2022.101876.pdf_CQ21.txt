Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of various performance metrics. The context provides a table with different performance measures, including True Negative Rate (TNR), False Positive Rate (FPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and Negative Predictive Value (NPV). These metrics are calculated using specific equations, which are also provided in the table.

Additionally, the context suggests that the model's detection threshold is varied to evaluate its performance at different thresholds (e.g., > 0, ≥ 25, ≥ 50, ≥ 75). This implies that the model's output is being evaluated at different confidence levels to assess its performance.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these postprocessing steps are involved in the model's evaluation.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training appear to include the calculation of various performance metrics and the evaluation of the model's performance at different detection thresholds.
