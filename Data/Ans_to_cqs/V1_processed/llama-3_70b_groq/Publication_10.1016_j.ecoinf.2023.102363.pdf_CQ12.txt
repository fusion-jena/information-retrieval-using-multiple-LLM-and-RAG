The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of the EfficientNet B0 network, which is a type of CNN architecture. The text also mentions that the model is fine-tuned on spectrograms, which are image-like representations of audio data, and that CNNs have been proven to perform well on classification tasks using spectrograms as image input.
