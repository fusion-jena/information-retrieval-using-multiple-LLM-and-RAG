I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the data pre-processing, machine learning models, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about where the data is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
