I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context only mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), but does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
