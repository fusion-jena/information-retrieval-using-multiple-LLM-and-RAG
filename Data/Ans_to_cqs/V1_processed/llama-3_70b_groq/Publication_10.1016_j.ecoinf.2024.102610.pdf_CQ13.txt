I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning model used, nor does it provide information about the hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning methodologies for predicting tsetse fly relative numbers, and it mentions the use of variable elimination techniques for random forests, such as RFE and VSURF. However, it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
