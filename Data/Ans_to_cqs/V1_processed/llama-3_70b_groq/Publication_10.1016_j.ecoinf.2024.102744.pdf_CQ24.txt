Based on the provided context, it appears that the Dropout layer is employed to mitigate overfitting, which is a common issue in deep learning pipelines. Overfitting can be caused by randomness in the training data or the model's parameters. The Dropout layer randomly sets a fraction of the neurons to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the capacity of the network.

However, there is no explicit mention of strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. It is possible that the authors of the paper used a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of their results, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.
