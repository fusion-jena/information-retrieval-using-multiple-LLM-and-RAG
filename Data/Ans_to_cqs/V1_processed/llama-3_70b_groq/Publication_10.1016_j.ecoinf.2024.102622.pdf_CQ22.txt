Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models (not specifically deep learning models) are R2, RMSE, and REP (%). 

R2 (coefficient of determination) measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). 

RMSE (root mean squared error) measures the average magnitude of the errors, with lower values indicating better performance. 

REP (relative error percentage) measures the relative difference between the predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance. 

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models in estimating rice LCC and rice canopy coverage. However, precision and recall are not mentioned in the provided context.
