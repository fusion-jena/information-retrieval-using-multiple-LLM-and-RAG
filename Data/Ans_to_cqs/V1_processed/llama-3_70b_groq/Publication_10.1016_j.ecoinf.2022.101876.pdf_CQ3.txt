The provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used to prepare the data for these models. Therefore, I don't know the specific annotation techniques used in this context.
