I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, habitat analysis, and urban development, with discussions on machine learning models, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC) values. There is no mention of deep learning or data preprocessing techniques, so I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
