The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning models, particularly XGBoost, in object recognition and categorization, specifically in the context of forest type categorization using high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data. The datasets used in this study are likely to be custom datasets collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and SPOT satellite equipment, but the specific details of the datasets are not provided.
