I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper discussing the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions in the GAB region. It provides information about the datasets used, including their spatial and temporal resolution and sources, but it does not mention a specific repository where the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
