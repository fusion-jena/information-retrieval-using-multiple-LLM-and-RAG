Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on explaining the Faster R-CNN approach, its components, and the role of the Region Proposal Network (RPN) in object detection. It also mentions some related studies and references to deep learning models, such as Inception-v4, ResNet, and Densely Connected Convolutional Networks. However, it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
