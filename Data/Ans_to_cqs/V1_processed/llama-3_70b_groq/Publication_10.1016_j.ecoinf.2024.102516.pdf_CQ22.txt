The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Scaled Absolute Error (MSAE), Intersection over Union (IoU) averaged over all plant species, and DCA-Procrustes-Correlation (DPC). These metrics are used to compare the different model setups and are reported in Table 1.
