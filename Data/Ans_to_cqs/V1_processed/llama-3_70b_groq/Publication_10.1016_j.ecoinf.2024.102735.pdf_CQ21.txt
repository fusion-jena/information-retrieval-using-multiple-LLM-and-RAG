Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, data acquisition, and model development for predicting chlorophyll-a using machine learning models. It discusses the division of datasets, model training, and the effects of including high-frequency datasets and sensor values on model performance. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
