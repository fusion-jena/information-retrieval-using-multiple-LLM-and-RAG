The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to automatically track and monitor the stereotypical behaviors of captive wild animals. Specifically, the Siamese relation network is used for object detection (to extract location boxes of the animals) and motion trajectory analysis. The model is also used for classification, as it classifies the motion trajectory patterns by calculating cross-correlation functions. Additionally, the model provides real-time warning prompts for stereotypical behaviors through a human-computer interaction interface.
