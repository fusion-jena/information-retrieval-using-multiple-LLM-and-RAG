The provided context does not mention specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and computer vision applications, particularly in the fields of forestry, ecology, and environmental monitoring.

The datasets mentioned in the context are primarily related to airborne and terrestrial LiDAR data, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery, and polarimetric SAR imagery. These datasets are used for tasks such as tree canopy segmentation, individual tree detection, mangrove crown diameter measurement, and wetlands classification.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context. The context does not provide information about the datasets used in a general deep learning pipeline.
