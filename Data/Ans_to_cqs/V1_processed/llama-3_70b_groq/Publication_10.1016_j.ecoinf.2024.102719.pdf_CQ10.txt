I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts related to machine learning, river health, and ecological informatics. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline.
