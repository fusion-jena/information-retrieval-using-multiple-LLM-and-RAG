Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks. It discusses the design and performance of various CNN architectures for HSI classification, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular context. However, in general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, data augmentation, and feature extraction, depending on the specific problem and dataset.
