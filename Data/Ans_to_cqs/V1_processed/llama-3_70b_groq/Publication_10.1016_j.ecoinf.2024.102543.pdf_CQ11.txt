I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the YOLOv8 algorithm, its variants, and modifications to the architecture, as well as evaluation metrics such as mAP, Params, and FLOPs. It also mentions the importance of model size and computational efficiency. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
