The context does not mention building a deep learning model or using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The analysis was performed using Python 3.8.5 and corresponding packages, but the specific packages mentioned are not related to deep learning. The focus of the work is on complex networks and acoustic environment analysis, not deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
