Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is normalization. Specifically, the input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) are normalized by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. This technique helps to reduce the impact of bias in the data by scaling the values to a common range.

It is not mentioned in the context whether other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used to address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used in this specific pipeline.

It is worth noting that the context focuses on the architecture of the D-Mask R-CNN model and its application to a specific dataset, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of data preprocessing techniques.
