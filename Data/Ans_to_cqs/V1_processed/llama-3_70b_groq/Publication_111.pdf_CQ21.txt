The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the data collection, preprocessing, and construction of the GRU-DNN model, as well as hyperparameter tuning and training. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
