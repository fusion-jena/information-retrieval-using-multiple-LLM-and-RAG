The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the keywords and descriptions, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely image-based, as the context mentions "Image classification", "spectral indices", "texture indices", and "Digital Surface Model (DSM)". Additionally, the mention of "UAS" (Unmanned Aerial System) suggests that the images may be acquired from aerial platforms. There is no mention of audio or video data formats. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is not explicitly mentioned, but it is possible that the data may be stored or processed in a tabular format. However, without further information, it is difficult to confirm the exact data formats used in the pipeline.
