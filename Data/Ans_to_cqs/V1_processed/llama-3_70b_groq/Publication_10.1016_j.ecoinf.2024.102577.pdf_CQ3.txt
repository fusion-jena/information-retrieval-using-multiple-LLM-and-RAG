I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research article on machine learning and sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery, and it discusses various machine learning algorithms and techniques, such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron, and Na√Øve Bayes. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
