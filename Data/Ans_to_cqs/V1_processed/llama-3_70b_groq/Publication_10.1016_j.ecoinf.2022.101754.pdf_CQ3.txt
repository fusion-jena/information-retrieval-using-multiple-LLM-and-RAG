I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and forest biomass estimation, discussing various machine learning methods and datasets used for this purpose. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
