I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the structure of the long- and short-term memory model neural network, Bayesian optimization, and the LSTM model, but it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
