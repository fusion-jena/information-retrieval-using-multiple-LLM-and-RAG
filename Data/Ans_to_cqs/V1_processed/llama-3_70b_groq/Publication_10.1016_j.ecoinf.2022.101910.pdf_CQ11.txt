I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context discusses BirdNET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology, and its ability to facilitate the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations. It also mentions various research papers and studies that have used BirdNET, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
