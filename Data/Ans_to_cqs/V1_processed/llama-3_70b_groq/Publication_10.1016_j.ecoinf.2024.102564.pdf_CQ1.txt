Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods used in this study involve soil sampling and topography analysis. Specifically, the researchers collected 20-30 soil samples for each plot to obtain a composite sample, and obtained information for the depths of 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm. They also used the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to analyze topography.

Additionally, the study mentions the use of airborne LiDAR data, which suggests that remote sensing techniques may have been employed to collect data. However, it is not clear if this is a primary method of data collection or if it is used in conjunction with other methods.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used to collect raw data. It is possible that other methods may have been used, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the raw data collection methods used in this study appear to involve soil sampling and topography analysis, with possible use of remote sensing techniques.
