I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on environmental equity and nutrient reduction, and it discusses online tools, map packages, and data availability, but it does not provide information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
