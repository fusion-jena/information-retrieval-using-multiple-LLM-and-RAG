The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does describe the pre-processing block in the encoder, which contains a convolution with a wide receptive field (5 × 5 kernel) and signal coarsening along the time axis (2 × 1 kernel). This is followed by coarsening, which involves recombining the concatenated output of 2 × 2 maximum and 2 × 2 average pooling using a 1 × 1 convolution.

Additionally, the context mentions that the feature representations are chunked along the time axis into T = 19 independent frames, each corresponding to 3.072 s. Each frame is then flattened and passed through a final linear layer to output T d-dimensional mean μ and log variance logσ2 vectors as parameters for the Gaussian variational posterior.

It does not mention any specific normalization, scaling, or cleaning steps. However, it does mention the use of batch normalization in the context of residual networks, which is used to mitigate internal covariate shift and stabilize training.

In summary, the preprocessing steps mentioned in the context are convolution, signal coarsening, and chunking of feature representations into independent frames. However, it does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or cleaning steps.
