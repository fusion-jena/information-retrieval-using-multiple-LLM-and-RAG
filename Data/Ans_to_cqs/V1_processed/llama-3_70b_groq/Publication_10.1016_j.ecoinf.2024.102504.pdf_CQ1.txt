Based on the provided context, it appears that the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Satellite images: The context mentions the use of Sentinel-3b SYN satellite images to collect data on air pollution in central European capital (Budapest) (Neckel et al., 2023).
2. Passive samplers: Self-made passive samplers were used to collect data on air pollution in Budapest (Neckel et al., 2023).
3. Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor vertical column density (VCD) products: The context mentions the use of monthly averages of five Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor VCD products, which include measurements of SO2, NO2, O3, HCHO, and CO (Section 2.2.1. RS data).

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that other methods may be used in different studies or contexts.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of all possible methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, this answer is limited to the specific examples mentioned in the provided context.
