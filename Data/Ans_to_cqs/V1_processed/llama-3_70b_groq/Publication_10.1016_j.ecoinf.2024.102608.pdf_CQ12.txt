I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific type of deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, being used in the pipeline. The context only mentions ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks) as one of the machine learning models used, but it does not provide further details about the architecture or type of ANN used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
