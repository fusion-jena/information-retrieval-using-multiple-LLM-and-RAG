The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that field recordings of bird calls are used as the raw data. This is mentioned in the context of the study on the southern black-throated finch, where field recordings are used to develop and demonstrate the value of an open access active learning method for building deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions passive acoustic monitoring, which suggests that sensors may be used to collect raw data. This is supported by the study by Ross et al. (2023), which mentions passive acoustic monitoring as a method for collecting data.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. However, it is possible that these methods may be used in other studies or applications.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that field recordings and passive acoustic monitoring using sensors are methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide explicit information on the use of surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data.
