The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm. This is mentioned in the context as "the hyperparameters of the heterogeneous ensemble models were set to those optimized by the TPE algorithms." The TPE algorithm is a probabilistic method that iteratively constructs a tree of Gaussian distributions to approximate the objective function and selects new hyperparameters for the subsequent rounds of ML evaluation. It is designed for efficient searching in high-dimensional spaces.
