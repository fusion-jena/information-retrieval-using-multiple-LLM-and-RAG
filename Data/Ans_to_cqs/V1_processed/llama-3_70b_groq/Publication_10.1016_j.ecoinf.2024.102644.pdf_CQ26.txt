Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on ecological modeling, species distribution, and data quality improvement, but it does not provide specific information on deep learning pipelines or data bias mitigation techniques.

The mentioned papers and texts discuss topics such as improving data quality, parallelizing data mining algorithms, automatic classification of climate change effects, and coastal degradation, but they do not touch on the specific query about addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
