I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the importance of data availability in data-driven projects, particularly in ecoinformatics, and mentions that STARdbi will urge its users to make their data as open as possible. However, it does not provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context also cites several research papers on deep learning for computer vision in ecological research, but these papers do not provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
