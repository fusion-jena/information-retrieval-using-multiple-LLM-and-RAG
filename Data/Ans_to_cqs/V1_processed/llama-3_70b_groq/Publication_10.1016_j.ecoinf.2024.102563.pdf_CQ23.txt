I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing classification methods such as MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF, and their performance on a dataset with different feature combinations. There is no mention of deep learning models, diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
