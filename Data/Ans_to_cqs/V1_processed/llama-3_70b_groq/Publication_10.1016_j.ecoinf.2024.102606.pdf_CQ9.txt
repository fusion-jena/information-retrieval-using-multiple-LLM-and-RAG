I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of Faster R-CNN and Resnet50 for object classification, the selection of species for identification, and the training parameters of the models. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
