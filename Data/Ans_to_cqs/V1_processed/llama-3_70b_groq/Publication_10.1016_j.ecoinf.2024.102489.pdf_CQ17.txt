Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the importance of training sample quality in machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) models, and how it affects their prediction results. It also mentions the use of deep neural networks to estimate leaf parameters, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
