I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and performance of various models, such as FRC_ResNet18FPN, FRC_ResNet34FPN, and FRC_ResNet152FPN, and how they are used for object detection tasks. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training.
