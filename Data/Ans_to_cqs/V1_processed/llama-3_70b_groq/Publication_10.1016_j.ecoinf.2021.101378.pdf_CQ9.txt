I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to a research article on predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease using machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information about a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
