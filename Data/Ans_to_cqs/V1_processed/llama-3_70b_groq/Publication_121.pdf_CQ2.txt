The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from the context, which mentions that the dataset is divided into a training set of 5789 images and a test set of 1930 images. Additionally, the context discusses the use of computer vision methods, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and image classification, further supporting the conclusion that image data is used in the pipeline.
