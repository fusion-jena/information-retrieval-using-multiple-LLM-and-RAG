Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of DEPP on simulated data sets, training and parameter sensitivity, and the performance of the model on different data sets.

However, it can be inferred that the model was tested on different data sets, including a 200-taxon data set and a 10,000-taxon data set, which may indicate some level of generalizability. Additionally, the authors mention that they did not select the optimal settings for the model and have not tested various settings on other data sets, implying that the model's performance may not be overfitted to a specific data set.

Despite this, the context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
