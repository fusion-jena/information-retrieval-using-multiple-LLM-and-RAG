Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training are:

1. Metrics calculation: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. These metrics are calculated using the confusion matrix.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is generated to illustrate the performance of the model. The confusion matrix consists of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the importance of input features in the model's predictions, but they are not mentioned in the given text.

It's worth noting that the context focuses on the evaluation of the model's performance using metrics and the confusion matrix, but it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps that may be involved in the model's deployment or further analysis.
