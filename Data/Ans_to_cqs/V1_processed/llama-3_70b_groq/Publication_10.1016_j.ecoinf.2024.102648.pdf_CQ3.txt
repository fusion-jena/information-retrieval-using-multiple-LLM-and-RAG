I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in predicting plant disease severity and forecasting disease incidence. It discusses the use of various models, including artificial neural networks, bootstrap forest, and boosted tree, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
