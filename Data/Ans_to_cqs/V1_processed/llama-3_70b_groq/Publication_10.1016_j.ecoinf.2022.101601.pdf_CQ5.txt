I don't know. The provided context does not mention any datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to permafrost and geohazard indices, with variables such as soil temperature, soil water content, and vegetation height. There is no mention of deep learning or image datasets.
