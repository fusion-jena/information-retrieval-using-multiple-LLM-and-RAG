I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. The context discusses various topics such as digital soil mapping, visualization of subsurface soil properties, river analysis, and node-based programming, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
