Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the text mentions that "Data augmentation on all patches was performed for all trained networks, in order to compensate for the high class imbalance and allow a better generalization." The data augmentation techniques used include random rotations between 0 and 180 degrees, brightness scaling between 0.4 and 1.6, and horizontal/vertical flipping to all patches on the fly as data was fed to the networks.

There is no mention of other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used to address data bias in this specific deep learning pipeline.
