Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology and techniques used for forecasting ecological water demand, such as the use of deep learning methods, SHAP values for feature importance, and scenario analysis of oasis NDVI. It does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure model generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
