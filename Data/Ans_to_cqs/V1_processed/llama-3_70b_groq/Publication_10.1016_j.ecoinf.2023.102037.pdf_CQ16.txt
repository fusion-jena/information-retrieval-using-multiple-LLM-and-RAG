Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on data splitting, model performance, and the importance of strict validation procedures in insect recognition studies. It discusses the limitations of random data splitting and the need for a practice-oriented approach to validate model performance. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
