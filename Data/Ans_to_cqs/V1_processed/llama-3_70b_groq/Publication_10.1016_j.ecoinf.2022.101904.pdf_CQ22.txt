Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Kappa Index (KI): This metric is used to measure the agreement between the predicted and actual classes.
2. Overall Accuracy (OA): This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances.
3. Average Accuracy (AA): This metric is used to evaluate the average accuracy of the model across different classes.
4. Time (h): This metric is used to measure the computational time required by the model.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of different deep learning models, including Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer (ST), CoAtNet, CNN + ST, GAN + ST, and 3DUNetGSFormer. The results of these metrics are presented in Table 5.

It is worth noting that precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model. However, the kappa index, overall accuracy, and average accuracy are used to evaluate the model's performance.
