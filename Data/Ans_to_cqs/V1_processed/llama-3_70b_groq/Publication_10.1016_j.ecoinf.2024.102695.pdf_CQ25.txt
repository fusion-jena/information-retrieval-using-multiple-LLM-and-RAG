Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning model. The context discusses various aspects of the model, such as its architecture, attention mechanisms, and experimental setup, but it does not specify the task or problem the model is intended to solve. 

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the model is likely used for sequence-to-sequence modeling or time series forecasting, given the mention of input sequences, positional encoding, and the use of a Transformer-based architecture. Additionally, the model's ability to capture context from the entire input sequence and its use of multiscale attention suggest that it may be suitable for tasks that require understanding complex patterns in sequential data. 

Despite these hints, the specific purpose of the model remains unclear, and more information would be needed to determine its exact objective.
