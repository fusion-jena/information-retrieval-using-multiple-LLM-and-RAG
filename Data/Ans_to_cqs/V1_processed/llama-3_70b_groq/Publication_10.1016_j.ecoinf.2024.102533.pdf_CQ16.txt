I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training completion criteria, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a research paper on fish freshness classification using machine learning and clustering techniques. It discusses the use of the elbow method to determine the number of classes and their duration, but it does not provide information on training completion criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
