I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to be related to acoustic tracking methods and data analysis of vocalisations, with a table showing the number of tracked vocalisations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole data set. There is no mention of deep learning or specific data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
