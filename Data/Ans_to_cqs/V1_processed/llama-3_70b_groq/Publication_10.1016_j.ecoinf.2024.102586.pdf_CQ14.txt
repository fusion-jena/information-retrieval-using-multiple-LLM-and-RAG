Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text explains the use of the random forest (RF) model and its advantages, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. It only mentions the use of the spatialRF package in R 4.2.2 software for implementing the RF model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
