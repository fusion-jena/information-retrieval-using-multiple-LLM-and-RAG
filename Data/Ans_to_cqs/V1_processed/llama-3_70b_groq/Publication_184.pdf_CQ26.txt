The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation as a technique to extend the amount of information and reduce overfitting. Data augmentation can be seen as a way to address data bias by artificially increasing the size of the dataset and providing more diverse examples to the model. 

The context mentions that each image was randomly sampled by one of the following options: the entire original image, horizontal flip, grayscale, blur, noise, and cropping. This suggests that the data augmentation technique is being used to increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce the risk of overfitting. However, it does not explicitly mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
