Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the discriminant analysis of species and sex, footprint anatomy, and geometric profiles. It discusses the development of a discriminant model to distinguish sex in marten and fisher, as well as a species discrimination model between fisher and marten.

However, it can be inferred that some form of model evaluation or validation was performed, as the context mentions the classification success rates of the models. For instance, it is mentioned that the full species discrimination model had a near-perfect classification success rate, misclassifying only 1 out of 532 tracks as the wrong species. Similarly, the simplified species discrimination model had a classification success rate of over 99%.

While the context does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices, it is likely that some form of model evaluation or validation was performed to assess the performance of the developed models. However, the exact steps involved are not specified in the provided context.
