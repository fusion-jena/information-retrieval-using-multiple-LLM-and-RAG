Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and tuning of a U-Net-like CNN for forest damage segmentation, as well as the implementation details of the neural network.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention batch normalization, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer in a neural network. This can be considered a form of preprocessing, but it is applied within the network architecture rather than as a separate preprocessing step.

Other than batch normalization, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
