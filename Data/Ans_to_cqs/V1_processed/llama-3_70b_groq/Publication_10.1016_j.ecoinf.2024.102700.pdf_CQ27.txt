I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It only mentions that deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, were used in some studies (e.g., Cazau et al., 2023), but it does not provide information on how these models were deployed. The context primarily focuses on the literature review methodology, search strategy, and results of the analysis, but it does not delve into the specifics of model deployment.
