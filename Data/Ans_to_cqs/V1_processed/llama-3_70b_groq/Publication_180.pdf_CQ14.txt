The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the authors calibrated their models for Mexican and Brazilian species using different numbers of training steps and considered two factors to find optima for training TensorFlow: correct identification rate and processing time. However, it does not specify the method used to optimize the hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
