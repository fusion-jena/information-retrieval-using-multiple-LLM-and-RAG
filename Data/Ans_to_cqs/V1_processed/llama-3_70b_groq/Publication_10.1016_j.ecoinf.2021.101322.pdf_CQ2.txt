The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references to image datasets (Salmon scale 9056 image dataset and Expert reading of extra 150 image dataset) and the use of a CNN-based architecture (EfficientNet), it can be inferred that image data is used in the pipeline. The format of these images is not specified, but it is likely to be a standard image format such as JPEG or PNG. No information is provided about the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the pipeline.
