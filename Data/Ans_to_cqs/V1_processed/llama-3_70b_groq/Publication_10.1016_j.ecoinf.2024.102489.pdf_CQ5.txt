The provided context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears to focus on satellite image data, specifically high spatial resolution satellite images from sources such as Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A. The context also mentions the use of MODIS products, including the MOD09A1 dataset, which is used for surface reflectance. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context. The context does not mention the use of any deep learning pipeline or datasets commonly used in deep learning applications.
