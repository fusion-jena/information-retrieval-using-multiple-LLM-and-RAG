I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions "Machine Learning models" and "intelligent models based on extreme learning machine" which is a type of machine learning model, but not a deep learning model specifically. It does not provide enough information to determine the type of deep learning model used, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
