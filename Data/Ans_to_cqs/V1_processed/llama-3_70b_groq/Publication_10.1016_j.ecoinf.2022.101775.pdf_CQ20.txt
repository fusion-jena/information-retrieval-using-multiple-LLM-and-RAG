I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses various aspects of deep learning models, such as embedding layers, stochastic gradient descent, and different variations of the DMF model. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
