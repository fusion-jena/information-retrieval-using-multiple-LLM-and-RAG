I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the comparison of deep learning (CNN) and shallow learning (XGBoost) methods for wetland class mapping in Alberta, Canada, using remote sensing data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Google Earth Engine. It discusses the potential of deep learning for image recognition and natural language processing, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
