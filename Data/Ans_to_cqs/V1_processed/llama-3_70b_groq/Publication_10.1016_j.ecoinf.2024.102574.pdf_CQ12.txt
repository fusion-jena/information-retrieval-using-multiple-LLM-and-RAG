I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. While it mentions the use of machine learning methods such as random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion techniques, and neural networks, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. Additionally, the context focuses more on the application of LiDAR, UAV, and hyperspectral data for tasks such as DTM creation, flood risk mapping, and tree species classification, rather than the specific deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
