The provided context does not mention any specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears to be related to a study on the spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes, where a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network is used to predict the Trophic State Index (TSI) based on input parameters such as aCDOM(254) and Fn(355). The dataset used in this study consists of 64 water samples, which are divided into two sets for model calibration and validation.
