Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, particularly Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE), for remote sensing image classification, specifically for detecting invasive species. It does not delve into the details of the deep learning pipeline or regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
