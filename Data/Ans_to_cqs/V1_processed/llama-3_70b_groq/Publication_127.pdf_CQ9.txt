I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the application of deep learning in animal identification, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is hosted. The context mentions various sources and references, but none of them point to a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine the location of the data repository.
