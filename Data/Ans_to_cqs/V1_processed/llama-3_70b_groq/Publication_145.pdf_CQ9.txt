I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It discusses the use of GeoEye-1 images, the U-net deep learning algorithm, and the MapBiomas project, but it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
