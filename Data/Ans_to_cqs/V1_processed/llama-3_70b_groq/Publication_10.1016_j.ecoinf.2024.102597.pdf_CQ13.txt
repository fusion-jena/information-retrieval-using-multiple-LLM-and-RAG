I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. In fact, the context mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model from the provided context.
