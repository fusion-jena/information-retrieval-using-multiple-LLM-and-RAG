Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be discussing the results of land cover/land use classification using deep neural networks (DNN) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization approach used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
