Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the definitions of model performance metrics, the performance of the image quality model on the test data, and the false positive model performance on the test data. It does not provide information on the training process or the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
