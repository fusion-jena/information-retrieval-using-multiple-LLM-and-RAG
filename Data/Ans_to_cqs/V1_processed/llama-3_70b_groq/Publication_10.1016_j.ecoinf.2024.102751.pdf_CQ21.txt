Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Accuracy assessment of the developed model: This is performed using the 'yardstick' package for R, specifically the 'metrics' function.
2. Metrics calculation: Three selected model parameters are calculated: 
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - R2 (R-squared)

There is no mention of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if these steps are involved in the postprocessing.
