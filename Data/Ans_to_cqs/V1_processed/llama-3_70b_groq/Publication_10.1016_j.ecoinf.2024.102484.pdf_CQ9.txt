I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a research paper discussing soil degradation, land use, and ecosystem services, but it does not provide information about the availability of a deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
