Based on the provided context, it appears that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer some information from the context.

The context mentions the use of remote sensing data, web-based APIs, and climate data, which suggests that the data formats might include raster or satellite imagery, CSV files for climate data, and possibly other formats such as GeoTIFF or NetCDF for geospatial data.

Additionally, the context mentions soil texture estimation, which might involve the use of data formats such as CSV or Excel files for storing and processing soil texture data.

However, it is essential to note that the context does not provide explicit information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.

In summary, while we can make some educated guesses about the possible data formats used, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
