The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The diagram in Fig. 1 shows the overall methodology, which includes preprocessing, model training and validation, prediction making, and ground truth validation. However, it does not provide details on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

The text mentions that the trained model is used for species prediction and size distribution comparison, but it does not elaborate on any postprocessing steps involved in these tasks. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
