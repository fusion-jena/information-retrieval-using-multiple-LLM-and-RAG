I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the methodology and architecture of the CNN model, the image acquisition protocol, and the dataset used, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
