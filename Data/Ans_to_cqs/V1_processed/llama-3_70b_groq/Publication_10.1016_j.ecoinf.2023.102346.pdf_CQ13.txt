I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The text discusses machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for habitat suitability prediction. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in these models, let alone deep learning models.
