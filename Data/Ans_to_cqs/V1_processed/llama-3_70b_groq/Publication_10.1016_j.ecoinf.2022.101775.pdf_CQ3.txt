I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on various topics, including IoT-enabled environment monitoring systems, sentiment analysis, modeling contextual changes in user behavior, and matrix factorization for data recovery in sensor networks. While it mentions deep learning models and techniques, such as CNN and embedding layers, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
