Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for voice feature extraction and classification. It discusses the automatic feature extraction process in deep learning, the use of spectrograms for visual representation of sound data, and the optimization of CNN model parameters.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to mitigate data bias and ensure that the model is trained on a representative and balanced dataset.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
