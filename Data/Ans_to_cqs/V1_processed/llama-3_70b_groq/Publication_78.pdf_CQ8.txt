I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various topics such as image classification, coral reef classification, and deep learning architectures, but it does not provide information about the code repository. The context includes references to research papers and algorithms, but it does not include a link or mention of a specific code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
