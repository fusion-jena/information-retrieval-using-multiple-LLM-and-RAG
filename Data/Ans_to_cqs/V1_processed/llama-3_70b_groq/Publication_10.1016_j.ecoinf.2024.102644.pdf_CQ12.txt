I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions "Artificial Intelligence models", "machine-learning models", and "neural networks" in general, but does not provide details on the specific architecture or type of model used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) based on the provided information.
