I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the experimental setting, comparative algorithms, and the framework of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss. It discusses the training process, optimization, and comparison with other algorithms, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
