I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the process followed to deploy it. The context appears to be a list of references related to coral reefs, marine ecology, and machine learning, but it does not provide information on the specific query asked. The only mention of a deep learning model is in the reference "Do, A.N.T., Tran, H.D., 2023. Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. Eco. Inform. 78, 102380." However, this reference does not provide information on the deployment process of the model.
