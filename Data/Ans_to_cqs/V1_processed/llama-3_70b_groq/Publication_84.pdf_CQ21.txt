Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, specifically the deep learning approach using the Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) classifier, and the classification performance assessment.

However, based on common practices in machine learning and remote sensing, some possible postprocessing steps that might be involved after model training include:

* Metrics calculation: This could include calculating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and others to evaluate the model's performance.
* Confusion matrix: This is a common postprocessing step to visualize and analyze the model's performance, particularly in classification tasks.
* Saliency maps: This is a technique used to visualize the importance of input features or pixels in the model's predictions.

However, these are just possibilities, and the actual postprocessing steps involved in this specific study are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
