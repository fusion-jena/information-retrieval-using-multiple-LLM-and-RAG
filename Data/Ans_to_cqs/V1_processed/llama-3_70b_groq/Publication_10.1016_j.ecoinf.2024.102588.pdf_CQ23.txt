According to the provided context, one of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model is 10-fold cross-validation. This is mentioned in the sentence: "Table 3 lists the mean and standard deviation values of the NSE and RMSE driven by the 10-fold cross-validation of the deep learning models." This suggests that the model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation to assess its performance and ensure its generalizability. However, there is no mention of other measures such as diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or others.
