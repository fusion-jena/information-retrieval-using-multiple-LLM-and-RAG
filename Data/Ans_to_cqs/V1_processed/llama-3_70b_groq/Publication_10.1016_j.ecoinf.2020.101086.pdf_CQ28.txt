I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model on a specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and the effects of sample size and sampling bias on their performance, citing a research paper from 2008 and another from 2020. There is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
