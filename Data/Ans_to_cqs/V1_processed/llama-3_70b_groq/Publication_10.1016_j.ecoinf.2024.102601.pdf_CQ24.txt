The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization for random forests using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library.

However, it can be inferred that RandomizedSearchCV is used to perform a probabilistic search over the predefined hyperparameter space, which involves evaluating a user-specified subset of hyperparameter combinations. This method aids in efficiently navigating vast hyperparameter spaces, particularly when there is uncertainty regarding the optimal values.

While this context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it suggests that RandomizedSearchCV can be used to handle randomness in hyperparameter optimization. However, it does not provide information on setting a random seed value or other strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, and I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer.
