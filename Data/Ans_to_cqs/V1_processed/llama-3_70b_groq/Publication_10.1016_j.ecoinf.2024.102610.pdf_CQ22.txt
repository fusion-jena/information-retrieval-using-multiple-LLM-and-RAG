The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in general. 

In the context, it is mentioned that the model performance was assessed based on the "out-of-bag" R2 and RMSE values, which indicate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. Additionally, R2 values are mentioned as a metric to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in predicting disease vector abundance. 

However, it does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
