I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be a research article or paper that discusses the use of a deep neural network for fish biomass estimation, but it does not provide any details about the code or its availability. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
