Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of hand-annotated data, self-supervised models, and semi-supervised frameworks, but it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

It is common in deep learning to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, or mean absolute error to evaluate model performance, depending on the specific task and problem. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine which metrics are used in this particular case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
