Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimental settings, data augmentation, and the use of transfer learning for recognizing endemic bird species. It does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
