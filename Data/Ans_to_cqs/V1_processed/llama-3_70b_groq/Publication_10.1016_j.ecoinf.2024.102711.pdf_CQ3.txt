I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on automated machine learning (AutoML), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and the use of AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library, for training high-performance machine learning models on structured data. It discusses the importance of hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing, and feature engineering, but does not touch on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
