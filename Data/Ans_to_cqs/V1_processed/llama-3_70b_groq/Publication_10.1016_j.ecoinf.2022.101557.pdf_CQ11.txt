I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for wetland annotation, data pre-processing, and model training, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to the data repository.
