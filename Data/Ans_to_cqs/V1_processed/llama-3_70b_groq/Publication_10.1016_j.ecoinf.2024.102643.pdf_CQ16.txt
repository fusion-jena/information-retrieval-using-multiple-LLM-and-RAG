The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the methodology used for modeling, including generating pseudo-absence points, splitting data into training and testing datasets, and evaluating model performance using AUC and TSS. It does not provide information on the specific stopping criteria used during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
