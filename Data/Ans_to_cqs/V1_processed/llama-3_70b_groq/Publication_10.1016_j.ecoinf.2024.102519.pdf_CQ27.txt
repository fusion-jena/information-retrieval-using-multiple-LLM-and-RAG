I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The text discusses various applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimization algorithms in ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on the deployment of a specific deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
