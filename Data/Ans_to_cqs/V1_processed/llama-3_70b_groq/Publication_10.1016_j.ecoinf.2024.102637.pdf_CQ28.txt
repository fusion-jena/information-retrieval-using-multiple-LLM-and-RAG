I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the development and optimization of a lightweight SIAlex model, its architecture, and its application in bird voice recognition, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the model.
