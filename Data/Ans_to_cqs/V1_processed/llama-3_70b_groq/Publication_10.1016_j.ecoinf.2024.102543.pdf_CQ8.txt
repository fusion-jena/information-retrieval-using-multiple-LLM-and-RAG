I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the development and application of a deep learning-based pipeline for pest detection, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
