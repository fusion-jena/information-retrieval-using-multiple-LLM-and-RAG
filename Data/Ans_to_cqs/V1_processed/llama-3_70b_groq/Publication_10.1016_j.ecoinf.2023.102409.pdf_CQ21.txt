Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architectures, hyperparameters, and their applications in segmenting vegetation areas. It does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
