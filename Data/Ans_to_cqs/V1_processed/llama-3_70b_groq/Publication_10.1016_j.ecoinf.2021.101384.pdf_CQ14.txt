The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the algorithm for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species, the input parameters required for the analysis, and the output of the workflow. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
