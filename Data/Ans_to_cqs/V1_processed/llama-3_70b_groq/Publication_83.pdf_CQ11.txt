I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of different CNN-based models for bird sound classification, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The paper does mention that the detailed information of the wood-warbler species involved in the dataset can be found in [23], but it does not provide a link to the dataset itself.
