Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be related to random forests, neural networks, and data visualization, but it does not provide specific information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention random initial values being assigned to connection weights of input and output neurons in a neural network (Section 3, Step 1). This suggests that randomness is introduced in the initialization step of the neural network, but it does not provide information on how this randomness is handled or controlled throughout the pipeline.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves techniques such as fixing random seeds, using reproducible random number generators, and controlling sources of randomness in data augmentation and other pipeline components. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
