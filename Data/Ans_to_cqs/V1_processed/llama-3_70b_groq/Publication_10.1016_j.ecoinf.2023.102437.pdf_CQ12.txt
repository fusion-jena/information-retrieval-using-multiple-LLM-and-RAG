Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), which is a type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). This is evident from the text, "LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to address some of the limitations of traditional RNNs when it comes to handling long sequences and capturing long-term dependencies in data." Additionally, there is a reference to a specific study that uses a "convolutional LSTM network" for ENSO forecasting, further supporting the use of LSTM models.
