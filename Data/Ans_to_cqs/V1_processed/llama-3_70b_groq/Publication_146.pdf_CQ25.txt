The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. This is evident from the context, which mentions "object detection" as one of the keywords and discusses the YoloV3 algorithm, which is a popular object detection model. Additionally, the text explains how YoloV3 works, stating that it handles the full image at once and creates feature maps to detect objects, further supporting the conclusion that the model's purpose is object detection.
