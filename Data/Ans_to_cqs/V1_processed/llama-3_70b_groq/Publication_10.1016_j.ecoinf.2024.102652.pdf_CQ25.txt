The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation, which involves assigning a category label to each pixel of an image. Specifically, the model is designed to detect and segment soil salinity and vegetation from remote sensing images without the need for ongoing field EC measurements, allowing for automatic monitoring and management of salinity.
