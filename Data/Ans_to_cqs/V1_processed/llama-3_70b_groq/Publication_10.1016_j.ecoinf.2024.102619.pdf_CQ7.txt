The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the authors conducted 5-fold cross-validation of the training set for both SVM and CNN training protocols. This implies that the data was split into 5 folds, where 4 folds were used for training and 1 fold was used for validation in each iteration. 

The context does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets. Typically, in machine learning, the data is split into three sets: training set (used to train the model), validation set (used to tune hyperparameters), and testing set (used to evaluate the model's performance). However, the exact criteria for splitting the data are not mentioned in the provided context.
