I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the use of CNN architectures such as ResNet, VGGish, MobileNet, and MobileNetv2 for bird vocalization classification/detection, and their suitability for deployment on mobile devices, ARU, or Internet of Things devices due to their memory, processing, battery, and network constraints. However, it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training these models.
