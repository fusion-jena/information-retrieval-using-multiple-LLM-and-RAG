The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context only describes the architecture of the model, SeedNet, and its components, but does not provide information about the framework or library used to implement it. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
