I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing machine learning models, specifically grid search models and hyperparameter tuning for water quality prediction. It mentions techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, and hyperparameter tuning, but does not mention data augmentation or deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
