The context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of eight different machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models for habitat suitability prediction. 

However, to ensure the generalizability of these models, several measures were taken. Firstly, 30% of each taxon's data records were utilized as testing data, while the remaining 70% were used as training data. This split helps to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 

Additionally, 10 K-fold cross-validation and 10-fold bootstrapping were employed to assess the models. Cross-validation helps to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data, while bootstrapping provides unbiased predictive accuracy with a sufficiently low variance. These techniques help to ensure that the models are generalizable to new, unseen data.
