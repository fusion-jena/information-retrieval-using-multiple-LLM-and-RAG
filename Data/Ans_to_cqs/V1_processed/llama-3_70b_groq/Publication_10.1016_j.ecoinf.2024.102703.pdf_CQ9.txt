I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The text appears to be a research article discussing the spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes and identifying eutrophication indicators in Southwest China. It provides information about the study area, field sampling, and sample collection, as well as references to other research papers. However, it does not mention a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
