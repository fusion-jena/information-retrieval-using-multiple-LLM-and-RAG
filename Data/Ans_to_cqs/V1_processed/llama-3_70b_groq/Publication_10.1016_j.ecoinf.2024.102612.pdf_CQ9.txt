I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of multispectral LiDAR data and deep learning approaches for wildfire response, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored. The context mentions various publications and research papers, but it does not specify a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
