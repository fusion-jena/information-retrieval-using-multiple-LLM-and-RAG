Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the performance of the LigObNet model in underwater fish species identification, including its accuracy, detection speed, and comparison with other models. It also mentions the division of the dataset into training and validation sets, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Typically, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include validation loss plateau, validation accuracy plateau, or reaching a certain number of epochs. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine which criterion was used in this specific case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
