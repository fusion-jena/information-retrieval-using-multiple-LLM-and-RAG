I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of classical and deep learning methods for generating synthetic data, including the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other techniques. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
