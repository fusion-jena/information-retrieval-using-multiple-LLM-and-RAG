I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. It only explains the architecture of the model, including the operations performed at each block of layers, and discusses the experimental results and potential directions for future research. It does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training.
