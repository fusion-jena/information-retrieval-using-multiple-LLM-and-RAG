The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that the model was trained for a total of 350 epochs, resulting in a total training time of 27 hours. There is no mention of a validation loss plateau or any other specific criteria being used to determine when to stop training.

However, it can be inferred that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of epochs (350) rather than based on a specific criterion such as convergence or a plateau in the validation metrics. The evaluation metrics provided in Table 2 show the performance of the model at different stages of training, but they do not indicate when the training was stopped.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified in the provided context.
