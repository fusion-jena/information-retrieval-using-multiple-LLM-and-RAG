I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context focuses on comparing different models (simple linear model, generalized linear model, and artificial neural network) for predicting SPAD values using the Rasp2SPAD prototype. It discusses the training and testing of these models, but it does not provide information on how to deploy a trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
