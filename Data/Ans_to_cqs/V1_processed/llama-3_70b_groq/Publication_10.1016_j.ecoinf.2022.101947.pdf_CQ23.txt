Based on the provided context, it appears that the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include:

1. Holdback trial partitioning test: The analysis was iterated 10 times for each combination of test/training size, with randomly selected trails, to examine how the predicted outcome compared with the known test set size.

2. Random selection of trails: Trails were randomly selected for each iteration of the holdback trial partitioning test, which helps to reduce bias and increase the generalizability of the model.

However, there is no mention of other measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. It is possible that these measures were not taken, but it is also possible that they were taken and not mentioned in the provided context.
