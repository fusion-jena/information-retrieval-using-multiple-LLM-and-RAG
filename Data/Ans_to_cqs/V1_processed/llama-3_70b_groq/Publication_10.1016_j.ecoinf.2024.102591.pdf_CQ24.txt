I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to wildfire events, vegetation recovery, and remote sensing, with tables and text discussing Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), wildfire events, and vegetation recovery products. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
