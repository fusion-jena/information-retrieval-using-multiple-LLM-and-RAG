I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a research study on vegetation health and its relationship with various drivers, using a technique called Optimal Parameter-based Geographical Detector (OPGD). The text explains the methodology used in the study, including data discretization, factor detection, and interaction detection, but it does not mention model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
