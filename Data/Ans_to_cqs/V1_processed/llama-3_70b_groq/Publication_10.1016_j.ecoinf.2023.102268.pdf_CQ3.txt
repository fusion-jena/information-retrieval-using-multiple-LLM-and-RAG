I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the use of ResNet-50 CNN to extract features from spectrogram images, and the classification of signals using a SVM classifier. It does not provide information on how the data was annotated or labeled for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
