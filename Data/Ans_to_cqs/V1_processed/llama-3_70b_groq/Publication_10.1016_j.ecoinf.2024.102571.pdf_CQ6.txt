Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to environmental and sustainability topics, with references to water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and wastewater treatment. There is a brief mention of a neural network model being developed with a specific architecture and activation functions, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. These steps help to prepare the data for training, improve model performance, and prevent issues like feature dominance or outliers.

If I had to speculate, based on general machine learning practices, the preprocessing steps might include:

* Normalization: scaling numerical features to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent feature dominance.
* Scaling: transforming numerical features to a common scale, such as standardization or min-max scaling, to improve model performance.
* Cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the data.

However, without explicit information, I cannot provide a definitive answer specific to the context provided.
