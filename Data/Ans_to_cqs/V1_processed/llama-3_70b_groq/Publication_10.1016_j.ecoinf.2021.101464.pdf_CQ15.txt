I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be focused on random forest models and multiple linear regression, which are machine learning techniques, but not deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
