I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any process related to model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context only discusses the training and validation of four machine learning models (AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression) for estimating forest above-ground biomass, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.
