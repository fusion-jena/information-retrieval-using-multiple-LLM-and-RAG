I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the limitations of using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for classification, such as computational time constraints and data processing volume, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. It only mentions the use of GEE, which is a cloud-based platform, but it does not specify the underlying hardware resources used for training the model.
