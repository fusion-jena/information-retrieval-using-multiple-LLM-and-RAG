I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It describes the architecture and components of the model, such as the encoder, decoder, attention mechanisms, and convolutional layers, but it does not provide information about the framework or library used to implement the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the model was built using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework.
