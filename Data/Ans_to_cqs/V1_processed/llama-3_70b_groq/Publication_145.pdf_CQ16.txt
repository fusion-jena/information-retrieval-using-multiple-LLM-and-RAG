The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that the network was trained for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch, but it does not specify how the decision to stop training at 300 epochs was made. It is possible that the training was stopped based on a plateau in the validation loss, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
