I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The context appears to be related to a research article in the journal Ecological Informatics, and it discusses species distribution modelling using generalized linear models and random forests. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
