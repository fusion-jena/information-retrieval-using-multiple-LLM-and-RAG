The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. This is evident from the context, which mentions "audio pre-processing", "audio files", and "spectrograms" generated using the Librosa library. The pipeline involves processing audio data, applying filters, downsampling, and extracting audio segments, which further confirms that the data format is audio.
