The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that the randomized grid search approach helps strike a balance between model complexity and the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting. This suggests that the authors are aware of the issue of overfitting and have taken steps to mitigate it, but the specific regularization methods used are not specified. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
