The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), is for land-use and land-cover (LULC) analysis, particularly for mapping land cover or more specifically woody cover. This is mentioned in the context as a potential future methodology for LULC analysis, suggesting that the deep learning model will be used for classification tasks, such as distinguishing between woody and non-woody land cover.
