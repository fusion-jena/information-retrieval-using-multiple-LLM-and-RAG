Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the methodology used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, the selection of training sites, and the analysis of mining expansion and its impacts on forest cover and health. It does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
