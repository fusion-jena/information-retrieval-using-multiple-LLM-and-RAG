Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is working with image data, specifically camera trap images. The text mentions "running a pre-trained detector model on images" and "embedding the obtained crops into a lower-dimensional space", which suggests that the input data is in the form of images. Additionally, the context mentions the use of object detection models and embedding models, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks involving images. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
