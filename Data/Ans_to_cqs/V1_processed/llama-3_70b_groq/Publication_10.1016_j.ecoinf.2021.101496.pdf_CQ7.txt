The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset was divided into a "training dataset" containing 60 randomly selected records and a "testing dataset" containing the remaining 29 records. This suggests that the data was split randomly, but the specific criteria or ratio used for the split is not provided.

In general, the criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Common practices include:

* Random split: dividing the data randomly into training, testing, and validation sets
* Stratified split: dividing the data into sets while maintaining the same proportion of classes or labels
* Time-based split: dividing the data based on time, such as using older data for training and newer data for testing
* K-fold cross-validation: dividing the data into k folds and using each fold as a testing set while training on the remaining folds

Without more information, it is unclear what specific criteria were used in this case.
