I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to research papers on urban expansion, flooding, and forest classification using deep learning models, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
