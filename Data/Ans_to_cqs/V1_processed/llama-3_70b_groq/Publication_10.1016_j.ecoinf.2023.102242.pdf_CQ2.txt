I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the processing of high-resolution remote sensing data, feature optimization, and classification methods, but it does not provide information about the data formats used. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
