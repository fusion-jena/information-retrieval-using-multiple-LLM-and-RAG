According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically in the input layer of UODN, include resizing the images to the required size and applying algorithms such as mosaic data augmentation. These preprocessing steps aim to make the distribution of the input data more uniform and enhance the ability of the model to represent the data, thereby improving the model performance during training.

There is no mention of normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps in the provided context. However, it is possible that these steps may be involved in the overall preprocessing pipeline, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the given text.
