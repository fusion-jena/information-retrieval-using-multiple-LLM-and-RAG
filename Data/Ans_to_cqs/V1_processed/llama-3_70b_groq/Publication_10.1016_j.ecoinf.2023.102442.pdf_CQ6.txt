Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on research related to Amazonian freshwater ecosystems, artisanal and small-scale mining, and remote sensing.

However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps might be involved in the process of detecting artisanal small-scale mining using deep learning, as mentioned in the papers by Couttenier et al. (2022) and Elmes et al. (2020). For instance, the paper by Elmes et al. (2020) uses a Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network, which might require preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the Sentinel-2 data.

Additionally, the context mentions the removal of isolated, small, misclassified pixels (usually 1-2 pixels in size) by selecting mining pixels above 3 pixel sizes (PROCESS), which can be considered a form of preprocessing or data cleaning step.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved in the deep learning models used in these studies.
