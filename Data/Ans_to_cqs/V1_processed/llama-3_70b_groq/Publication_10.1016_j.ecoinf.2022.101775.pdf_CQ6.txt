According to the provided context, one of the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model is scaling. Specifically, a min-max scaler is used, which is reverted at the end to compute the performance metrics in the test set. No other preprocessing steps such as normalization, cleaning, or feature engineering are explicitly mentioned in the context.
