According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is early stopping, which is set to deploy if the validation loss does not improve within 10 epochs. This is mentioned in section 2.2, Model fine-tuning, where it is stated that "early stopping set to deploy if the validation loss does not improve within 10 epochs". This means that the training process will stop if the validation loss does not decrease or improve within 10 epochs, indicating that the model has converged or reached a plateau.
