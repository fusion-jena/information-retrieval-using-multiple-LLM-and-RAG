According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Cumulative Score (CS). 

The MAE is defined as the average difference between the predicted age and the true age of the panda, calculated as 1/N * ∑(i=1 to N) |yi - ̂yi|, where N is the number of images, yi is the true age of panda xi, and ̂yi is the predicted age.

The CS is defined as NI/N, where NI is the number of images when |̂yi - yi| < I, and I is a threshold distance in years, which is set to 3 in this paper.

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
