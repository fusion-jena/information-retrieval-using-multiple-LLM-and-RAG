The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, as well as the machine learning and statistical models, are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2. These metrics are used to assess the correctness of the system and determine how far the predictions differ from the actual data.
