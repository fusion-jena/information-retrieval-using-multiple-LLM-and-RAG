I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The text appears to be an introduction to a research paper in ecological informatics, discussing the variability of animal abundances across space and time. It mentions various statistical and analytical techniques, such as Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc), Dynamic factor analysis (DFA), Dynamic time warping (DTW), State space model (SSM), Template model builder (TMB), Theil-Sen analysis (TSA), and Wildlife Management Area (WMA), but does not mention deep learning or any measures to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
