Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

* Learning rate (α): The learning rate is used in the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer to update the weights. The value of α is not explicitly mentioned in the context.
* Momentum weight (µ): The momentum weight is used in the SGD optimizer to update the weights. The value of µ is not explicitly mentioned in the context.
* Optimizer: The optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
* Weight decay (λ): The weight decay is used as a regularization term in the loss function. The value of λ is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

No other hyperparameters are mentioned in the provided context.
