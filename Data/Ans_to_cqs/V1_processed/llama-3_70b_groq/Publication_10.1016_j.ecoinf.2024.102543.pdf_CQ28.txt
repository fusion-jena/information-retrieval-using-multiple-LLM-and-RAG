I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the YOLOv8 algorithm, its architecture, and modifications made to improve its performance, as well as the application of the model to detect and count NBSB in soybean fields. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
