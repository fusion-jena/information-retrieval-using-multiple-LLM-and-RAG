I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the concept of weakly supervised learning, specifically in the context of regression tasks with structurally incomplete target labels. It discusses various terms and definitions used in the literature to describe weakly supervised learning tasks and presents a case study on predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. However, it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model.
