The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the evaluation metrics used, such as RMSE and R2, and the process of hyperparameter search, but it does not specify a stopping criterion for training.

However, it is common in machine learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, early stopping, or a maximum number of epochs to determine when training is complete. These criteria are not mentioned in the provided context, so I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given information.

In general, the choice of stopping criterion depends on the specific problem, model, and dataset. It is possible that the authors used one of these common criteria, but it is not mentioned in the provided context.
