Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the architecture of the deep neural network, the activation functions used, and the implementation details in Python using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. However, it does not provide information about regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
