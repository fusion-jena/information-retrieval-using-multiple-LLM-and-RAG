The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The paper mentions the creation of the "Agmon annotated dataset" to evaluate the performance of BirdNET, which comprises over 10,900 annotated recordings of more than 75 species. However, it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context only mentions that the annotations were carried out, but it does not provide further information on the methods used.
