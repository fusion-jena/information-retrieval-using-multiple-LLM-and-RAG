Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the refinement of hyperparameters, model evaluation, and hyperparameter selection using cross-validation resampling. It also discusses the input data, which includes precipitation, maximum and lowest temperatures, and various land use factors, but it does not provide information on how this data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
