I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context only mentions that the framework relies on the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model, but it does not provide any information about the model's architecture or hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
