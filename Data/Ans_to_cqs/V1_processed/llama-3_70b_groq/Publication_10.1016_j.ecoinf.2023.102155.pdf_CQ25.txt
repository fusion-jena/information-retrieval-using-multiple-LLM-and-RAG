I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses methods for species distribution modeling, including extensions to accommodate bias correction and lasso-type penalties. It mentions algorithms based on mixture modeling and machine learning, but does not specify a deep learning model or its purpose. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
