The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It suggests that a sensible approach is to initially set options based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis tasks, and then attempt to refine certain settings through trial and error. However, it does not specify whether grid search, random search, or any other method is used for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
