I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a repository where the deep learning pipeline code is available. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning approaches for estimating water quality parameters using satellite data, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is located.
