Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be a collection of random characters, symbols, and numbers, which do not provide any meaningful information related to the query.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, and k-fold cross-validation, but the context does not provide any insight into these methods.

If you can provide more relevant context or information, I may be able to help you better.
