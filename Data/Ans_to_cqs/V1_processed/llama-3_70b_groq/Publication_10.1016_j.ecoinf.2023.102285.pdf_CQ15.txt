Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on various studies related to object detection, classification, and tracking in different environments, including underwater and aerial surveys. It discusses the use of deep learning models, machine learning approaches, and computer vision techniques, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
