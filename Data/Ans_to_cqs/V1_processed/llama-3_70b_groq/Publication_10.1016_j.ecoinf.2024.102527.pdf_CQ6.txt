Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experiment design, model training, and hyper-parameters used for the ResNext-101 model. It discusses the training process, optimizer, and hyper-parameter settings, but it does not provide information about preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
