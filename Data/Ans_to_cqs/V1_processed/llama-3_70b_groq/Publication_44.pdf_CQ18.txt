Based on the provided context, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use validation loss. The model with the best validation loss is saved at the end of the training process. This is mentioned in the sentence: "At the end of the training process, the best performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the Faster R-CNN model with a NMS threshold of 0.7 during testing." This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training by tracking the validation loss, and the model with the lowest validation loss is selected as the best-performing model.
