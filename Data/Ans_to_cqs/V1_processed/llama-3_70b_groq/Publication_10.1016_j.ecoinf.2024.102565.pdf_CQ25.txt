The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression. The model is designed to predict Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration solely based on wind speed data. The model is trained to process and transform input data (wind speed) to produce a desired output (TSM concentration). This is a classic regression problem, where the model learns to map input features to a continuous output variable.
