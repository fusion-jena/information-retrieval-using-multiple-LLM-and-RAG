The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are image rotation, changing contrast, and changing brightness. Specifically, for each original segment, 12 new ones are generated by varying the orientation of the individual (image rotation), the contrast, and the brightness of the image. The image rotation involves generating three missing rotations to cover all possible positions in which the model can find a fish. The contrast and brightness are altered using Equation 1, where each pixel x of the image is multiplied by α to alter the contrast and β is added to change the brightness. The possible values for α and β are {α ∈ ℝ : 0.9 ≤ α ≤ 1.1} and {β ∈ ℕ : -4 ≤ β ≤ 4}, respectively.
