The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the feature class is set as 'L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP', and the regularization multiplier is set from 0.5 to 5, with the optimal parameters being identified as 'LQP' and a regularization multiplier of 3.5. However, it does not specify the method used to search for these optimal parameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
