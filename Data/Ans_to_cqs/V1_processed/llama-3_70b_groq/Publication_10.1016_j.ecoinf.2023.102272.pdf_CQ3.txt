I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation of different machine learning models, including deep neural networks. It discusses the model selection procedure, model architectures, and performance metrics, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
