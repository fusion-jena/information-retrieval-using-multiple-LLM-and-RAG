The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it can be inferred from the evaluation set description that the data is split into different sets for specific purposes. 

The target training set is used to train the target model, the validation set is used to validate the hyper-parameters, and the target test set is used to assess the classification accuracy of the target model. The attack set contains examples of non-members and is used to train the attack model. The evaluation set contains non-members whose identities are different from the one used to build the attack model.

It can be inferred that the data is split based on the purpose of each set, such as training, validation, testing, and evaluation. However, the specific criteria used to split the data, such as the proportion of data in each set or the method of splitting, are not mentioned in the provided context.
