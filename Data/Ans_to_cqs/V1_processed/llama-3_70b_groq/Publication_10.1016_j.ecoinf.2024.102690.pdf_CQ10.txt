I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be discussing ecological corridors, ecosystem services, and spatial analysis, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
