I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the model selection procedure, the parameters tested for classical machine learning models, and the data partitioning process, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
