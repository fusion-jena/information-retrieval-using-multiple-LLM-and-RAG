I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling using Maxent, and discusses model evaluation and selection using AICc values. There is no mention of deep learning or neural networks.
