Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the description of the STARdbi system, its components, and their inputs and outputs. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that may be involved after model training.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the output of the STARdbi_train component, which is a classification model in the form of a binary pickle file. It also mentions the STARdbi_inference component, which takes unannotated single-insect image files as input and produces a prediction. But it does not provide further details on any postprocessing steps that may be involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to answer the query about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
