I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be discussing a research study on above-ground biomass and soil organic carbon, using machine learning models and spatial cross-validation. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not mentioned in the context.
