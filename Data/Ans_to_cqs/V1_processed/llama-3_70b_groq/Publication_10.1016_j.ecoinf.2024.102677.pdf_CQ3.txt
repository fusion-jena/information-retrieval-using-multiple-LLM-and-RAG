The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context only discusses the use of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification and landscape type prediction. It does not provide information on how the training dataset was annotated or prepared for the deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
