The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, Conditional Kappa, and True Skill Statistic. The accuracy metric is limited in value due to the unbalanced class distribution, where only 3.48% of the data points are classified as disturbed. Therefore, additional metrics are used to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
