I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the development stage of the model, including data preprocessing, model construction, and hyperparameter tuning, but does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
