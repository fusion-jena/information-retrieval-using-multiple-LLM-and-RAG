Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the performance of different models (FRCNN, TPH-YOLOv5, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m) on a specific task, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using a method such as grid search or random search, but this is not specified in the text. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
