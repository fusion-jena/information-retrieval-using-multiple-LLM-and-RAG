Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, particularly the use of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and the advantages of using more CNN layers in the ResNet152 model. It also discusses the challenges of object detection in UAV thermal images due to limited spatial resolution. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used or the evaluation methods employed to ensure the model's generalizability.
