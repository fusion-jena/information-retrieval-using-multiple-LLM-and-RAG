The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for river health prediction. The model is likely used for classification, as it is mentioned that the model relates river health to gradients of environmental factors, which suggests that the model is predicting a categorical outcome (i.e., healthy or unhealthy river). Additionally, the context mentions that the model is used to identify potential causes of impairment in areas of ecological concern, which further supports the idea that the model is used for classification. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
