I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context appears to be an abstract or introduction to a research paper on water contamination analysis in IoT-enabled aquaculture using deep learning, and it does not include any details about the implementation or availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is located.
