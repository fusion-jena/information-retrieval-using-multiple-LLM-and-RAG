I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The text appears to be a research article discussing the use of deep learning methods for analyzing animal behavior, but it does not include any details about the code or its availability. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
