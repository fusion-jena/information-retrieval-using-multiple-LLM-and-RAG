The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve), overall accuracy, Kappa Score, and F1-Score. Additionally, other metrics such as precision, recall, and sensitivity are also mentioned in the context, but it is not explicitly stated that they are used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, it can be inferred that these metrics might be used as well, given their relevance to model evaluation.
