The provided context does not mention deep learning models or specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be related to building models for species distribution modeling, and it discusses steps such as obtaining presences and background points, separating data into folds, performing scale optimization for environmental covariates, subsampling background points, training component models, and evaluating models using AUC and TSS.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context. The context does not provide information about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
