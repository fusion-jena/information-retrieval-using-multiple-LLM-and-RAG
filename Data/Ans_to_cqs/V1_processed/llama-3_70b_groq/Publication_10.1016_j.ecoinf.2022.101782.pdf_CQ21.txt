The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It only discusses the model training process, including the hyperparameters used, the data augmentation techniques applied, and the model evaluation metrics. 

However, it is mentioned that the best model was selected based on minimal validation loss, and the model's performance was evaluated on an independent test set of 2060 images. The evaluation metrics mentioned include training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, and validation accuracy. 

There is no mention of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
