The query asks about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, the provided context does not mention a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses a machine learning model, specifically a regression task using an ensemble of decision trees.

According to the context, the evaluation metric used to optimize the model's hyperparameters is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Additionally, the performance of the model is evaluated using the Mean Bias Error (MBE) and R2 metrics.

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall, which are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Since the task is a regression task, these metrics are not applicable.

In summary, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model are RMSE, MBE, and R2.
