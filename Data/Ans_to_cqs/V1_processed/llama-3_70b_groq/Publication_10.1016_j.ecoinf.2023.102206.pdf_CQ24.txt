Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on transfer learning, domain adaptation, and uncertainty quantification in machine learning models. It discusses various techniques, including IFTL and FTL, to improve learning by restricting overconfidence and controlling hesitancy during transfer learning. However, it does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
