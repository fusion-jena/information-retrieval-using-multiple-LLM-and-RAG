The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions the use of convolutional and pooling operations in the encoder stage, also referred to as the feature extractor. The context also specifically mentions the use of VGG, ResNet, and Xception architectures, which are all types of CNNs. Additionally, the description of the network architectures in Appendix A further supports this conclusion.
