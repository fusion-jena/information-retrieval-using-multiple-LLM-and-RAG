I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the limitations of general deep learning networks for underwater optical images, the original YOLOv8 network, and the input layer of UODN (Underwater Object Detection Network). It also explains the preprocessing operations performed on the input images, but it does not provide information on how the trained model is deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
