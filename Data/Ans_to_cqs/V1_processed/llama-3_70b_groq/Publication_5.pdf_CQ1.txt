The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data collection methods vary depending on the specific application or field of study.

For instance, in remote sensing applications, data collection methods might involve the use of sensors, such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, as mentioned in reference 29. Additionally, reference 67 mentions the use of drone images for mapping raised bog vegetation communities.

In other cases, data might be collected through surveys, as implied by reference 29, which mentions vascular plant species richness in a natural forest in central Chile.

Public datasets might also be used as a source of raw data, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline appear to vary depending on the specific application or field of study, and might include the use of sensors, surveys, and public datasets. However, more information would be needed to provide a more detailed answer.
