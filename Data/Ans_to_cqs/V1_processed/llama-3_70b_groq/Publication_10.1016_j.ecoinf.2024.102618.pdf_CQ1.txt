The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the application of deep learning models for plant disease classification, data augmentation techniques, and performance metrics. It does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

However, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this study is likely a collection of images, as the text mentions "provide crystal-clear images for further examination" and "data augmentation technique is added to increase the number of images from 55,448 to 61,486 images." The source of these images is not specified, but it could be a public dataset, such as PlanVillage, which is mentioned in the text.

In summary, the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, but it suggests that the dataset consists of images, possibly from a public dataset or a collection of images obtained through other means.
