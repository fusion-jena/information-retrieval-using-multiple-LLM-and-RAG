The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It only mentions that the training process consisted of 150 epochs with a batch size of 4 and a learning rate that initially started at 10^-4 and gradually decreased over the course of training. However, it does not specify how the training process was terminated or what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It is possible that the authors used a validation loss plateau or another criterion to determine when training was complete, but this information is not provided.
