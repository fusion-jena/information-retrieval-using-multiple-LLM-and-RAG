I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses model complexity, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian Optimization, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
