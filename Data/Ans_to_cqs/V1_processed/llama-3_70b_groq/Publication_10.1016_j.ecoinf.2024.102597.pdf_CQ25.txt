The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for estimating water quality parameters (WQP), specifically Chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations in lakes. The model is not used for classification, segmentation, or detection, but rather for regression tasks, as it is mentioned that the model is used to estimate Chla concentrations.
