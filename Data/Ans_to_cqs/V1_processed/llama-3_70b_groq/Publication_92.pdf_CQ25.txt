The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is designed to classify feature vectors into different fish species. The architecture of the network follows the GoogLeNet's architecture with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier, which is typically used for classification tasks. The model is trained on a database of images with their corresponding labels, where the label is the fish species. The goal is to enable the model to learn features from the images and classify them into their respective species.
