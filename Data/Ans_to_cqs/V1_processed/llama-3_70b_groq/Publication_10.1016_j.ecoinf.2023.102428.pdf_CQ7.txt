Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the research design, data processing, and MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) parameters and performance. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Typically, the data is split into 60-80% for training, 15-20% for testing, and 5-10% for validation. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this specific study.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this study.
