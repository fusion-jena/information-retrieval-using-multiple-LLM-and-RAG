I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. It mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. It also discusses various machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), neural network, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), XGBoost, and CatBoost, but does not specify a deep learning model used in the pipeline.
