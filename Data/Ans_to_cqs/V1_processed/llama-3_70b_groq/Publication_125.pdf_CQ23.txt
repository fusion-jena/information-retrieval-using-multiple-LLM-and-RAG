The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques used in the research. Figure 6 shows sample image data augmentation results, including rotation, zoom, shearing, horizontal and vertical shift, brightness, and horizontal and vertical flip. This suggests that data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the dataset and potentially improve the model's generalizability. 

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques commonly used to ensure generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken.
