The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe some techniques that introduce randomness into the pipeline:

1. Random horizontal flipping of images during data augmentation.
2. Scaling the contrast of each image channel by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2 during data augmentation.
3. Randomly cropping the image to a square with side lengths equal to the image height during data augmentation.

These techniques introduce randomness to increase the diversity of the training data and help the model generalize better. However, the context does not provide information on how to handle randomness in the pipeline or set a random seed value.

Therefore, I don't know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value, based on the provided context.
