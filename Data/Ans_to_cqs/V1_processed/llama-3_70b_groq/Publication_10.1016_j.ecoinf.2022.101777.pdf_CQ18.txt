Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the accuracy assessment of the classification results, discussing parameters such as Error of Commission (EC), Error of Omission (EO), Producer Accuracy (PA), and User Accuracy (UA). It also mentions the use of the Semi-Automatic Classification Plug-in (SCP) for the RF classifier and post-processing tools to obtain reports from each classifier. However, it does not provide information on the strategy used to monitor the model performance during the training phase. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
