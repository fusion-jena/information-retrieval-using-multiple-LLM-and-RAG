Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix, or any other related topics. The context primarily focuses on differences in gain among recording devices, a proposed preprocessing approach, and references to various research papers. There is no information about model training or postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
