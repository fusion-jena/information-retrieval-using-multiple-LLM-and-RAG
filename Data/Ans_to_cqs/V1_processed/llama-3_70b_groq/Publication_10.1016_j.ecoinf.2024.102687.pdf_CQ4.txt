The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that supervised-based methods rely on data augmentation to create image pairs that can be used to build training tasks, but it does not specify the techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
