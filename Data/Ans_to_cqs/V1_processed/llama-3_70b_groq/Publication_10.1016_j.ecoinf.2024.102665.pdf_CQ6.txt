Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on coral reefs, marine biology, and clustering methods, with no direct reference to deep learning model preprocessing.

However, it's worth noting that the context does mention the use of a deep learning model in one of the references (Do, A.N.T., Tran, H.D., 2023), but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps used in that study.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
