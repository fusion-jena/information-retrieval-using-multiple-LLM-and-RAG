The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is individual identification, specifically for snow leopards. The model is designed to identify individual snow leopards from images, which is a type of image classification problem. The model is trained to match query annotations with the correct individual snow leopard, and its performance is evaluated using top-k accuracy metrics, where k = 1, 5, and 10. This suggests that the model is intended to identify individual snow leopards from images, which is a crucial task in wildlife conservation and research.
