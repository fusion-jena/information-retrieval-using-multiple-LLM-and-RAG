Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the implementation of Random Forest Regression (RFR) and CART models for nearshore bathymetry studies, including the fine-tuning of model parameters and the comparison of different models. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
