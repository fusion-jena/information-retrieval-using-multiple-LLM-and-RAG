The provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the AutoML procedure involves training candidate models on a small subset of the data (At) and evaluating their performance on a left-out validation data set (Av). This suggests that some form of data partitioning is used, but the specifics are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the data was balanced by randomly duplicating presence records and deleting absence records to obtain a balance of ~50:50. This was done for the data sets used for internal assessment of accuracy, but it is not clear if this balancing was done for the entire dataset or only for the subsets used for training and validation.

Overall, while some measures were taken to address class imbalance and evaluate model performance, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the extent to which generalizability was ensured.
