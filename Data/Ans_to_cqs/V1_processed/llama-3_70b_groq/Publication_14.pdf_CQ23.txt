Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. There is no mention of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the development and application of the DeepMeerkat GUI for hummingbird video analysis.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset of images collected for each class, and the feature vectors for the frozen layers were extracted in parallel using Google Cloud DataFlow. This might suggest that the dataset was relatively large and diverse, but the context does not provide further details.

Additionally, the model was designed to be conservative, with a high threshold for retaining frames, which might help reduce overfitting and improve generalizability. However, without explicit information on the measures taken to ensure generalizability, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
