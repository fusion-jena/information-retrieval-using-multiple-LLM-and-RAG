The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning pipeline or datasets commonly used in deep learning such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to a study on identifying species and sex of fisher and marten using camera trap images and FIT (Footprint Identification Technique) metrics. The datasets used in this study are reference datasets of known species for fisher and marten and known sex for fisher, which were created using camera trap images. The study uses 167 marten and 367 fisher tracks to extract 124 morphometric variables for identifying species and sex. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
