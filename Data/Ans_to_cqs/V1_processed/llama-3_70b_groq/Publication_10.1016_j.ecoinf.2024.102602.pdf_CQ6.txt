According to the provided context, before implementing deep learning models, the images were resized to the same resolution (227Ã—197 pixels) by considering the mean dimensions of the set. Then, the images were normalized to the [0,1] range. These are the preprocessing steps mentioned in the context. There is no mention of scaling or cleaning as preprocessing steps.
