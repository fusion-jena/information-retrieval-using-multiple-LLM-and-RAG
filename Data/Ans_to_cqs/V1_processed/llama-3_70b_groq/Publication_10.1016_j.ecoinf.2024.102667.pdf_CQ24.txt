I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental science and ecology, with references to papers on topics such as desertification, drought, grassland gross primary production, and vegetation responses to climate change. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning concepts. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
