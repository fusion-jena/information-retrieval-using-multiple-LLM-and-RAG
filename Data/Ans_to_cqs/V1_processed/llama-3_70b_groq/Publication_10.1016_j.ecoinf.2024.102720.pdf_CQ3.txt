I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on research in natural areas, such as agro-land ecology, and mentions various models and algorithms, including deep learning, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
