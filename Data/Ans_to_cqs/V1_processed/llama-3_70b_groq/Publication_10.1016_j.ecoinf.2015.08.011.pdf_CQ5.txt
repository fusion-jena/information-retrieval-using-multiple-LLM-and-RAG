I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting aquatic insect species richness in running waters, and it mentions that the data set was randomly split into two sets, 80% for model training and 20% for model testing. However, it does not specify the name or type of dataset used.
