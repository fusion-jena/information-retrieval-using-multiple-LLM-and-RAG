The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, but it does not specify whether it was built using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
