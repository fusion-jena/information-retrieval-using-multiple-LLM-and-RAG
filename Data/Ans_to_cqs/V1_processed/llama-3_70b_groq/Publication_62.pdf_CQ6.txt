The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, specifically the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. 

However, it can be inferred that the input data is in the form of 3-tensors with shapes such as 3×256×256, which suggests that the input data might be RGB images. The presence of BatchNormalizationLayers in the network architecture implies that batch normalization is used during training, which is a form of normalization. 

Beyond this, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling, cleaning, or data augmentation. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the provided context what specific preprocessing steps are involved before training the deep learning models.
