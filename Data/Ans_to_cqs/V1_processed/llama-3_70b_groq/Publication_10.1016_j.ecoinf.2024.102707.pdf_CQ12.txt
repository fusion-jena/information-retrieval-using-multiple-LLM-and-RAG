Based on the provided context, I can identify a few instances where deep learning models are mentioned. 

In the paper by Le, Samaras, and Lynch (2022), a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is designed for the automated survey of seabird colonies.

In the paper by Peng et al. (2020), a modified Faster R-CNN is used for kiang detection in Tibetan plateau.

However, I couldn't find a specific mention of the type of deep learning model used in a pipeline in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

If more context or information is provided, I may be able to give a more specific answer.
