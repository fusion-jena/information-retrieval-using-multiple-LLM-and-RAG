Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only describes the architecture of the CNNFAST network, including the number of convolution layers, filters, and fully connected layers, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
