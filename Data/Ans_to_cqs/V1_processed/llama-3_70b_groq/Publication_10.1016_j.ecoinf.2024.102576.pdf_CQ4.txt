I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context discusses the use of deep learning models for land use and land cover classification, phenology-based multi-index, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) in vegetation remote sensing. It also mentions the importance of increasing data during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imageries over multiple periods. However, it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
