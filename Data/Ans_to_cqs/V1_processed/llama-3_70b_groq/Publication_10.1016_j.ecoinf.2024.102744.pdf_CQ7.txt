Based on the provided context, it appears that the data is split using K-fold cross-validation. This is mentioned in the text as "We utilize K-fold cross-validation to partition the dataset into 5 distinct subsets. Each subset undergoes evaluation, and the final result is derived from the average of these evaluations."

This suggests that the data is split into 5 folds, and each fold is used as a validation set while the remaining folds are used for training. This process is repeated 5 times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. The final result is the average of the evaluations from each fold.

There is no explicit mention of a separate test set, but it can be inferred that the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training, and the final evaluation is done on the entire dataset.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide information on how the data is split into training and testing sets, but it's common practice to use techniques like stratified splitting or random splitting to divide the data into training and testing sets.
