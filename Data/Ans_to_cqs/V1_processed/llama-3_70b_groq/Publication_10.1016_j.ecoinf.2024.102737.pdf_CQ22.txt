Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is precision. This is evident from Table 3, which presents the precision results of each experiment for the upper-, left-, and right-pose models. The table shows precision values for different measures (P1, P3, P5, and P6) for each experiment (E1 and E2).

There is no mention of other metrics such as accuracy, recall, or F1-score in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that precision is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study.
