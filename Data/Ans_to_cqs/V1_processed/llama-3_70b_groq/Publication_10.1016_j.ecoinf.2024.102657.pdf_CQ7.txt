According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows:

* The first 70% of songs in the folder are used as the training set.
* The next 10% are used as the validation set.
* The last 20% are used as the test set.

This split is done to reduce variability between tests. The training and validation sets, totaling 80% of the full dataset, are used to train and validate the CNN spectrogram classifier and to train the k-NN location classifier. The remaining 20% of the data set is reserved to test the two systems' ability to classify songs correctly.
