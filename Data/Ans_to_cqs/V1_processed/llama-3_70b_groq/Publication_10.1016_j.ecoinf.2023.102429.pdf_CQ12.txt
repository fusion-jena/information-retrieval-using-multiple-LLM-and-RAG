None of the provided context mentions the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context only mentions various machine learning algorithms and techniques, including Random Forest (RF), Partial Least-Squares Regression (PLSR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), but does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
