The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained again on all the annotated scans earlier and tested on a different un-annotated dataset. The model's performance was evaluated based on visual inspection, and around 200 scans were annotated by hand to evaluate the precision of the organ detection model on this dataset.

It appears that the model's performance was monitored through a combination of visual inspection and manual annotation of a subset of the dataset. The average precision metric was used to evaluate the model's performance, but the specific strategy implemented during training is not mentioned.
