Based on the provided context, it appears that the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through audio recordings using acoustic sensors or recorders. Specifically, the context mentions collecting 120 hours of audio recordings per site, with a sampling protocol that considers sample duration and its effect on indices. It also mentions the use of different recorders, such as SongMeter and AudioMoth, with specific settings for sampling frequency (FS) and gain.

The context does not mention surveys or public datasets as methods for collecting raw data. Instead, it focuses on the design of the sampling protocol, the characteristics of the recorders, and the processing of the acoustic data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary method for collecting raw data is through audio recordings using acoustic sensors or recorders.
