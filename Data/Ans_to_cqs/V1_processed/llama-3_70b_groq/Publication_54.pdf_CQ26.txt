Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is data augmentation. The text states that "we augmented the training dataset 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images." This suggests that the authors used data augmentation to increase the size of the training dataset and potentially address issues related to data bias.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned which specific technique was used to address data bias. The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, the answer is that data augmentation was used, but the specific technique used to address data bias is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
