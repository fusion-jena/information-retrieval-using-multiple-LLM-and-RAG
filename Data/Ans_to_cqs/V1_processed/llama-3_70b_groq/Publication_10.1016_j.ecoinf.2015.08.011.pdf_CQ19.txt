The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It only discusses the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for predicting mosquito abundances and mentions the selection of the number of layers, neurons, learning rates, and epochs for model training. It does not provide information about the programming framework or library used to implement the ANN model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
