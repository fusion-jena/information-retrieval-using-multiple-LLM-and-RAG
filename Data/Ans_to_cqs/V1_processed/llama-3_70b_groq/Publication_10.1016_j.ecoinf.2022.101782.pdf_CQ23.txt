The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that image augmentation was applied in the form of horizontal flip, 0.2 degree counter-clockwise shear, and a random zoom between 0 and 0.2. This suggests that the model was trained on a dataset with some level of diversity, which could contribute to its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a dataset of 24,675 images and validated on a separate dataset of 32,986 images. This implies that some form of data splitting was used, but it is not clear if this was done using stratified splitting or cross-validation.

Overall, while some measures were taken to increase the diversity of the training data, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the full extent of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
