I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or specific data formats used in such a pipeline. The context appears to describe a data platform that integrates and enriches data from various sources, including monitoring networks, satellite images, weather, and environmental data. The data sources and their characteristics are summarized in Table 1, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in such a pipeline.

The context does mention that the validated data is loaded to the Access tier through an incremental ETL procedure, and that the relational schema of the integrated data is discussed in Appendix A.2. However, this information does not provide insight into the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query, and I do not want to make an assumption or provide an incorrect answer.
