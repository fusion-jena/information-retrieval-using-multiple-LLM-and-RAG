The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning or any regularization methods to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing discriminant analysis for species and sex identification, specifically using linear discriminant analysis. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any techniques used to prevent overfitting in such a pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
