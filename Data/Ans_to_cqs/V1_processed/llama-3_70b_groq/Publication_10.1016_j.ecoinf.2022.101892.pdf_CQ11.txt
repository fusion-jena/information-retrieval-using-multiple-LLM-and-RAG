I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a discussion of various deep learning models, such as ResNet, RepVGG, and MobileNet-V3, and their performance in certain experiments. There is no mention of a data repository link or a specific platform where the data is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
