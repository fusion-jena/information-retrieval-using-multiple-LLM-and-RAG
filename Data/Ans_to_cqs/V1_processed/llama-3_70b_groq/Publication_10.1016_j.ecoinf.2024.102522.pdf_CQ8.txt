I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of academic papers and articles related to ecological informatics and the study of the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea). There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository, nor is there any indication of a connection to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
