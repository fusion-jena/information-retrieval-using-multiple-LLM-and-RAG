The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MRE, and accuracy, as these metrics are reported in the tables (Table 5 and Table 7) and discussed in the text. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a dropout layer as a regularization method to avoid overfitting, which suggests that the model's performance on the training set is being monitored to prevent overfitting. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training is not explicitly stated.
