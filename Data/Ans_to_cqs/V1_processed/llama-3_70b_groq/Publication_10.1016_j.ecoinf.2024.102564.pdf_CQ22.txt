The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models (not specifically deep learning models) in this study are:

1. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
3. Coefficient of determination (r)
4. Bias

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) models in estimating net growth in Atlantic Forest fragments. The values of these metrics are reported in Table 2 of the study.
