Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on a specific algorithm for optimizing the iteration number in a machine learning model, particularly XGBoost, and does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

The context discusses the use of a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme, splitting datasets into tuning, validation, and test sets, and calculating out-of-sample R2 values to optimize the iteration number. However, it does not mention any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
