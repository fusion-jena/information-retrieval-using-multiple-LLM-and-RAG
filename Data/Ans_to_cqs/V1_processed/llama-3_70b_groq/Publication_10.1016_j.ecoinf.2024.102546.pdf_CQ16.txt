I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to a research paper on weed detection using YOLOX and YOLOv8 models, and it provides information on the dataset curation, hyperparameter settings, and experimental results. However, it does not mention the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, number of epochs, or other metrics. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
