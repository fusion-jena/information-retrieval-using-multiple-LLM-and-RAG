I don't know.

The provided context does not contain any information about a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of neural network architectures and hyperparameters, along with some references to academic papers. There is no mention of a specific code repository or a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link as it is not present in the given context.
