I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to fisheries, marine ecology, and sustainability, with references to various research papers and techniques such as support vector machines, multilayer perceptrons, and naive Bayes. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
