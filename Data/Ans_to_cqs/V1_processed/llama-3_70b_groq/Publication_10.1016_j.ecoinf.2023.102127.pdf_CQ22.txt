The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models or the specific metrics used to evaluate their performance, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention the use of True Skill Statistics (TSS) as a validation metric, which is implemented in the "modEvA" R-package. Additionally, the context discusses the importance of considering all available data and the challenges of model evaluation, especially when dealing with biases and sampling methods that can differ between datasets. It also mentions the use of thresholding to create binary, categorical percentile, and normalized outputs. Therefore, it can be inferred that the evaluation metrics used might be specific to the ecological niche modeling context and may not be limited to traditional machine learning metrics.
