Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of CNN, ViT, ResNet, and YOLOv7 models, as well as the CA-Hybrid network, but it does not provide information about the datasets used to train or evaluate these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
