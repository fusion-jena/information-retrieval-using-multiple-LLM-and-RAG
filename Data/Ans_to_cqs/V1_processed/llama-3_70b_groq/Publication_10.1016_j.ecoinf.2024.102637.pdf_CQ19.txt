Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses the design and optimization of the SIAlex model, its architecture, and its application to bird sound recognition, but it does not provide information about the framework used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
