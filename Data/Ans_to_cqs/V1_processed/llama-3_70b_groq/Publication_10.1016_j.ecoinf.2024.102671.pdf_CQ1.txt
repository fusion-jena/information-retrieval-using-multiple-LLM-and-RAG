Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods are not explicitly mentioned in the context of a deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible data sources from the context.

The context mentions various data sources such as the Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center, National Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Scientific Data Center, National Earth System Science Data Center, and Chinese Research Data Services Platform. These data centers provide datasets related to ecological carbon sinks, landscape ecological risk, and other environmental factors.

Additionally, the context mentions Openstreetmap and Geospatial Data Cloud, which suggest that geospatial data might be used in the analysis. The context also mentions different spatial resolutions (30m, 300m, 90m, 1km) which could be related to remote sensing or satellite imagery data.

It can be inferred that the raw data might be collected from a combination of these sources, including public datasets, geospatial data, and possibly remote sensing or satellite imagery data. However, the specific methods of data collection, such as surveys or sensors, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
