I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context discusses the use of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
