Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the description of different machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine, and their hyperparameters. It does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
