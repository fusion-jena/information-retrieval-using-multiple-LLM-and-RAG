The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification and prediction. Specifically, it is used for hyperspectral image classification, predicting eucalyptus biomass, and estimating carbon stocks. The models, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks, are trained to classify or predict continuous values from input data, such as multispectral and SAR data, or hyperspectral images.
