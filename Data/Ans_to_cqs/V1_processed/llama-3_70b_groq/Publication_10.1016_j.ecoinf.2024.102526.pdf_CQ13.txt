I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a table describing various fields and their descriptions related to ecological informatics, image capture, and sampling protocols. There is no mention of deep learning models or hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context seems to focus on metadata and annotation standards for ecological and environmental data, rather than machine learning or deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the relevant information is not present in the context.
