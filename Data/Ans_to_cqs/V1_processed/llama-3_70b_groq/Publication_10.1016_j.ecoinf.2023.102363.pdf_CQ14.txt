The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the hyperparameters used for fine-tuning the base model, such as the cyclical learning rate of 0.0004, the number of epochs (50), early stopping, and dropout rate (0.2). However, it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were chosen or optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
