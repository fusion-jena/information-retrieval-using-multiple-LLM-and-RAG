I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context discusses the use of various machine learning models, including deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), and the implementation of regression analyses using Python and specific libraries such as Scikit-learn, XGboost, and LightGBM. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform used to host or deploy the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
