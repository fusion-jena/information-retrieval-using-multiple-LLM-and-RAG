The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the COCO-Stuff dataset, which is used for semantic segmentation tasks, includes 164 K well-annotated images. This suggests that the annotations in COCO-Stuff might be in the form of semantic segmentation masks, where each pixel in the image is labeled with a class label. 

Additionally, the context mentions SegFormer, a deep-learning model for semantic segmentation, which is used for GVI learning. This implies that the annotations in the UGE-D dataset, which is used to train the GVI-learning model, might also be in the form of semantic segmentation masks.

However, it does not provide information on whether bounding box annotation or instance segmentation is used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the exact answer to this query based on the provided context.
