Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on various studies related to remote sensing, machine learning, and agriculture, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

However, in general, common practices for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets include:

1. Random splitting: Randomly dividing the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.
2. Stratified splitting: Splitting the data while maintaining the same proportion of classes in each set.
3. Time-based splitting: Splitting the data based on time, such as using older data for training and newer data for testing.
4. K-fold cross-validation: Dividing the data into k folds, using k-1 folds for training, and one fold for testing.

Without specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used for data splitting in the mentioned studies.
