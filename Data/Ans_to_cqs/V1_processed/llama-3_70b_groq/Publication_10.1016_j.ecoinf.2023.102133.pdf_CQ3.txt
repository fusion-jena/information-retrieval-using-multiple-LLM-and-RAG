I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models, but it does not discuss data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context seems to focus on the application of ANNs and MLPs to estimate evapotranspiration (ETa) and save irrigation water, and it discusses the features used in the model, the dataset, and the performance of the models. However, it does not provide information about data annotation techniques.
