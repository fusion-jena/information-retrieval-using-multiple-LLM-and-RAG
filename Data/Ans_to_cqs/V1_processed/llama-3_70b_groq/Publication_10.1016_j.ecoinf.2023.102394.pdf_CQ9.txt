I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The references cited are mostly academic papers and datasets, but none of them provide information about a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions various datasets and tools used in the study, but it does not provide information about where the pipeline itself is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available.
