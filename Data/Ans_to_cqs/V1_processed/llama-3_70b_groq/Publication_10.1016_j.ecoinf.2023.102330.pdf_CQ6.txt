Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for acoustic detection of Northern Bobwhite covey calls and discusses the use of a previously developed CNN model for detection and localization of covey calls.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform preprocessing steps on the data before training a model. These steps may include normalization or scaling of the data to ensure that all features are on the same scale, cleaning the data to remove noise or outliers, and potentially transforming the data into a suitable format for the model.

Since the context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps, it is unclear what exact steps were taken before training the CNN model. It is possible that the authors of the study performed some preprocessing steps, but this information is not provided in the given context.
