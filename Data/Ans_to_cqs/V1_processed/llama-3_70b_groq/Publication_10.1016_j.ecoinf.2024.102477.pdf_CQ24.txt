Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on various applications of deep learning and machine learning models in different domains, including air pollution, solar energy, and time series forecasting.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of different deep learning models, such as SGRU, LSTM, and SLSTM, which may inherently involve strategies to handle randomness. For instance, some models may use techniques like dropout or batch normalization to reduce overfitting and improve robustness to random variations.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of ensemble feature selection and deep learning models for intrusion detection in cloud computing, which may also involve strategies to handle randomness. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact strategies employed.

In summary, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
