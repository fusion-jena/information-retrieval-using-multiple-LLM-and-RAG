I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on object detection models, feature maps, anchor boxes, and the architecture of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
