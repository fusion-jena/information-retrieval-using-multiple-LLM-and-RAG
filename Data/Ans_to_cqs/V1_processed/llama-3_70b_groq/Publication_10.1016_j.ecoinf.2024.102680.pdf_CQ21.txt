Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, AP (Average Precision), AP50, AP75, and FPS (Frames Per Second). 

It also mentions a table (Table 1) that provides detailed descriptions of the evaluation metrics, but the context does not provide the actual table. 

Additionally, the context does not mention Saliency maps or Confusion matrix as postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
