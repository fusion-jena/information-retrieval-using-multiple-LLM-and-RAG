Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the monitoring framework, BirdNET-Analyzer, and its performance evaluation on a dataset of annotated bird calls. It discusses the preprocessing steps, such as dividing acoustic signals into 3-s segments, identifying species using BirdNET-Analyzer, and filtering out predictions with lower confidence scores. However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
