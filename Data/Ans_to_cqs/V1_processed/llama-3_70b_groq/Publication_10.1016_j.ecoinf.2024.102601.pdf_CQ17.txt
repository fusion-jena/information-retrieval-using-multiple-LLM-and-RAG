The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library. It discusses the optimization of hyperparameters such as n_estimators, max_features, min_samples_split, max_depth, and criterion for the RF algorithm. 

There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
