Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image and video data formats. There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats. The context mentions "images", "wildlife videos", and "UAV images", indicating that the pipeline is focused on processing visual data. Additionally, the discussion of convolutional layers, feature extraction, and instance segmentation further supports the notion that image and video data are the primary formats used in the pipeline.
