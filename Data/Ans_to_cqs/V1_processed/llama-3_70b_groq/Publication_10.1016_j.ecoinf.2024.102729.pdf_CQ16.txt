The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the framework followed in the study, which includes selecting input variables, splitting datasets into training and testing subsets, building and evaluating RF models, removing weakest input factors, and selecting optimal RF models. 

However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the RF models, including adj_R2, RMSE, MAE, and KGE. These metrics are used to compare the performance of the models on the training and testing datasets. 

It can be inferred that the training process might be considered complete when the performance of the model on the training dataset is satisfactory, and the model is able to generalize well on the testing dataset. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated.
