According to the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and recall. Specifically, the Average Precision (AP) is used to assess the detection performance of the models. The AP is used to evaluate the model's ability to detect objects of different sizes, including small, medium, and large objects. The context also mentions that the FRC_ResNet152FPN model obtains the best detection precision and recall trade-offs, indicating that both precision and recall are considered in evaluating the model's performance.
