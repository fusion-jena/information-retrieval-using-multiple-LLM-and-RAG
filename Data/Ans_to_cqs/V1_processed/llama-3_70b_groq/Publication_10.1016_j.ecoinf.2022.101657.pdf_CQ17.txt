I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in camera traps for wildlife monitoring, including instance segmentation, object detection, and species identification. It discusses various techniques and models used for these tasks, such as Mask R-CNN, Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation, and Scaled-YOLOv4, but does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
