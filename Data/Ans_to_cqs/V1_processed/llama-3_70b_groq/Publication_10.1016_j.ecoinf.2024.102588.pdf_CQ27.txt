I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the performance of different deep learning models, such as CNN and CNN with autoencoder, and compares them with conventional machine learning models. It also explains the architecture and hyperparameters of the models, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
