The measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models (not specifically deep learning models) include the implementation of a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset for all machine learning models. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the models are generalizable to new, unseen data. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
