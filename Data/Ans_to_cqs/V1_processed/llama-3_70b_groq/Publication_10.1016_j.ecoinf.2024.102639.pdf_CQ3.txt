I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the integration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies in animal behavior studies, particularly in T-maze experiments. It mentions various machine learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
