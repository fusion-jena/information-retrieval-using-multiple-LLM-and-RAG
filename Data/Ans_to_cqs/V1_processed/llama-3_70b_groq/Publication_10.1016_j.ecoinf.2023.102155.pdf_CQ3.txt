I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the performance of different methods in a classification task, specifically in the context of relabelling and predicting intensity maps. There is no mention of deep learning, bounding box annotation, or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
