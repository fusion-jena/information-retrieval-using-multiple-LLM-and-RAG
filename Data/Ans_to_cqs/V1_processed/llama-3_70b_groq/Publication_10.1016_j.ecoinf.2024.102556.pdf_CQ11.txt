I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the use of multiscale feature fusion techniques for target detection, and it does not provide information about data repositories or links to specific datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
