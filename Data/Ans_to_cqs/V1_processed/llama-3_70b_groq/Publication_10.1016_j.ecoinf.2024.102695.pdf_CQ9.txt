I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the experimental setup, model architecture, and results of the research, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository where the data is stored (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF).
