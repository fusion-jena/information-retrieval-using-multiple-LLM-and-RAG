I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which is a cloud-computing platform for geospatial analysis, but it does not provide a link to a specific data repository. The GEE is mentioned as a platform that offers an extensive repository of Earth observation data, but it is not a data repository link specific to the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
