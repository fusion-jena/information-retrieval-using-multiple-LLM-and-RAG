I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline. The text discusses the use of an information theory-based transfer entropy approach for network generation, specifically mentioning the Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) and TPINet. There is no mention of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
