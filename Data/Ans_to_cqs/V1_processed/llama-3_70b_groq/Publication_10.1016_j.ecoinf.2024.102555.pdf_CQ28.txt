I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) used for deployment. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and climate change research, with references to various studies and datasets. There is a mention of the Google Earth Engine platform in one of the cited studies, but it is not related to deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
