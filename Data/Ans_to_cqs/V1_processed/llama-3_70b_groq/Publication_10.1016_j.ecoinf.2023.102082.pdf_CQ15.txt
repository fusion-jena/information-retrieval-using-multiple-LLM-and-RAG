I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only mentions the use of a deep learning approach with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to create the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10m resolution using Sentinel-2 optical images. It does not provide details on the optimization techniques used during the training process.
