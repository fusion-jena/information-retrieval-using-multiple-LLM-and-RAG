The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the references and text, it can be inferred that the deep learning models are used for forecasting and prediction tasks. For example, in the paper by Dehghani et al. (2023), the authors compare the performance of LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches. Similarly, Feng et al. (2017) use a data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection for short-term wind forecasting. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that the purpose of the deep learning models in this context is likely regression-based forecasting or prediction, rather than classification, segmentation, or detection.
