The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the training was conducted over 500 epochs with an initial learning rate of 10, halved every 20 rounds to optimize performance, culminating in the selection of the most effective model weights for each cycle. This suggests that the training process is based on a fixed number of epochs, and the learning rate is adjusted during training to optimize performance. However, it does not provide a specific criterion for determining when training is complete.
