Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model varies depending on the specific application. 

In the study by Sharma et al. (2017), the deep learning model was used for manual annotation of karyotyping images of chromosomes, which suggests that the model was used for classification or detection.

In the study by Xu et al. (2021), the Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model was used for segmentation, specifically to outperform other methods in segmenting images.

In the study by Guo et al. (2021), the deep learning-based model was used to classify points of interest in 3D volumetric images, specifically to identify cross-over points or overlaps in filaments.

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning models in these studies is a combination of classification, segmentation, and detection.
