The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The text only describes the architecture of the BirdNET model, including the number of layers and parameters, as well as the data pre-processing and augmentation techniques used during training. It does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
