The frameworks used to build the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data analysis was performed using open-source libraries and frameworks for the Python 3 programming language, and Keras 2.12.0 is listed as one of the main libraries used. Keras is a high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Therefore, it can be inferred that Keras is the framework used to build the deep learning model, but the underlying backend is not specified.
