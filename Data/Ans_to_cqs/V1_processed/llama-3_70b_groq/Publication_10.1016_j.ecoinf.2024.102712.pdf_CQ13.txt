I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to forestry and remote sensing, with references to papers and reports on aboveground biomass density, forest surveys, and lidar data. There is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
