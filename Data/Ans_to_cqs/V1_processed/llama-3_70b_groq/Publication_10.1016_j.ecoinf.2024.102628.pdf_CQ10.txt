I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions the use of the fast.ai platform and the ResNet-34 architecture, but it does not provide a link to a specific code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to the code repository.
