I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of neural networks for species identification, the potential for bespoke neural networks for specific species sets, and the implementation of low-power neural networks in hardware. It also mentions various studies and techniques used in camera trap data analysis, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.
