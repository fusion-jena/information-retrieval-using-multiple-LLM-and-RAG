I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the application of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with the ResNet50 model, the architecture of the implemented CNN, and the potential of other datasets and models for pre-training. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection.
