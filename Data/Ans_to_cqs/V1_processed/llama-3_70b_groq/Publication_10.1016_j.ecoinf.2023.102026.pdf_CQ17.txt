The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on random forests, a type of ensemble learning algorithm, and its advantages over CART models. It also discusses the importance of resampling techniques, such as bootstrapping, and the impact of data structure on model outcomes.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The context does not provide information on deep learning or regularization methods.
