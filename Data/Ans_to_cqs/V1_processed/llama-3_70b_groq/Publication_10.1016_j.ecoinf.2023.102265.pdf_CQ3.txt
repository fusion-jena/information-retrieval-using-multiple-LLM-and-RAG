The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text focuses on image feature extraction using a ResNet-50 model and its application in image classification. It does not provide information on the annotation techniques used to prepare the data for the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
