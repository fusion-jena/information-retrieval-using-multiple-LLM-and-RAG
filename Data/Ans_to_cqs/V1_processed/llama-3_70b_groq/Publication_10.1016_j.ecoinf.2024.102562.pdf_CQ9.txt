I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses the application of deep learning algorithms for bacterial image recognition in environmental samples, but it does not provide information about the availability of the pipeline or its repository. The mentioned references are citations of other research papers, but they do not seem to be related to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
