Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be related to deep learning techniques for animal recognition and tracking in wildlife videos, but it does not discuss the specific topic of handling randomness in the pipeline.

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to employ strategies such as:

* Fixing the random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting and improve model robustness
* Implementing data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training dataset and reduce the impact of randomness
* Averaging model predictions over multiple runs with different random seeds to improve model stability

These strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, but they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness.
