Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of a deep neural network for fish biomass estimation, the YOLOv5 model for real-time detection of free-swimming fish bodies, and the importance of high-quality target detection in dealing with the complexities of the underwater environment. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
