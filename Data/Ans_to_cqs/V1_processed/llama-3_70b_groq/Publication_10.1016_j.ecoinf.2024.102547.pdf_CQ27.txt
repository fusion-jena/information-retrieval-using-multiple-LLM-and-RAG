I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to a study on multifrequency acoustics dataset analysis using Functional Data Analysis (FDA) in the West African waters. It discusses the use of FDA to analyze the relationships between the SSL spatial structuration and the pelagic environment. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
