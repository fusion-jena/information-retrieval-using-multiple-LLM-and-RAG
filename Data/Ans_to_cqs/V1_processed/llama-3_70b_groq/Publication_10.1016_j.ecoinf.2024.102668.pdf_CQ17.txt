I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. The context appears to be related to audio signal processing and acoustic indices, with discussions on preprocessing approaches and differences in gain among recording devices. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
