The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning or specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on machine learning and movement ecology, with mentions of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, but it does not provide information about deep learning or the data formats used in such a pipeline.

However, it can be inferred that the context is related to movement data, possibly in the form of location and movement data, which might be stored in formats such as CSV or other tabular data formats. But this is only an inference and not a direct answer to the query.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.
