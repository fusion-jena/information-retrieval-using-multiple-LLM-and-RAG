Based on the provided context, it appears that different deep learning models are used in various pipelines. 

In the paper by Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018), a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for wetlands classification.

In the paper by Martins et al. (2021), machine learning and SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) are used for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas.

In the figure and table provided, a BEV (Bird's Eye View) Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm is used for segmentation.

In the paper by Chen et al. (2021), PointNet, a deep learning model, is used for individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data.

In the paper by Mohammadimanesh et al. (2019), a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) is used for semantic segmentation of polarimetric SAR imagery.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that different deep learning models are used, including CNN, R-CNN, PointNet, and FCN.
