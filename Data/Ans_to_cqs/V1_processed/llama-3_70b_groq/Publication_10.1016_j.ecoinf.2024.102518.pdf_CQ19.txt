I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. The text discusses species distribution modeling, regularization multipliers, and evaluation metrics such as AUC-ROC and CBI, but it does not provide information about the deep learning frameworks used. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
