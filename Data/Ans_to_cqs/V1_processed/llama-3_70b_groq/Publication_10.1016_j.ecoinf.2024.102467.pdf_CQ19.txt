I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various papers and articles, but it does not provide information about the implementation details of the deep learning models, including the frameworks used. Therefore, I cannot determine which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning models.
