The context does not specifically mention deep learning models, but it does provide information on the data splitting criteria used for machine learning models. According to the text, for each run of the cross-validation procedure, 30% of the forest fire occurrence data was reserved as a validation set, and the remaining 70% of the data was used to train the model. This implies that the data was split into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). There is no mention of a test set.
