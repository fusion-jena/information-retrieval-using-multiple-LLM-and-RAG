The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. 

The context suggests that the model is designed to classify bird species based on their spectrograms. The model produces a probability for each of the 22 species, indicating that it is a classification task. The model's architecture, which includes convolutional layers, max pooling, and fully-connected layers, is also consistent with a classification task. Additionally, the text mentions "bird classification task" explicitly, further supporting the conclusion that the model's purpose is classification.
