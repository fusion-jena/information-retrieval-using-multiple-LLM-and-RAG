Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to evaluating the performance of a model using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
