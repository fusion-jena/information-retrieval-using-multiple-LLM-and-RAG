Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The paper by Chalmers et al. (2021) mentions the use of acoustic monitoring and deep learning for modelling animal biodiversity, but it does not provide details on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
