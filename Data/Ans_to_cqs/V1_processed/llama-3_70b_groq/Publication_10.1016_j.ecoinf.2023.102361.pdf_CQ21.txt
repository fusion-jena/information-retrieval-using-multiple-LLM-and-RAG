The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the dataset splitting, deep learning models, model training, and experimental setup, but it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps.

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using some metrics, as the context mentions "evaluation of the models" and "validation accuracy". But the specific metrics used or the postprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as whether saliency maps were generated, metrics were calculated, or a confusion matrix was created.
