The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the challenges of applying deep learning to natural systems, particularly in remote sensing, due to the lack of large training datasets and the need for annotated data. It also mentions approaches such as semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and using pseudo labels to generate training data.

However, it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to mitigate data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
