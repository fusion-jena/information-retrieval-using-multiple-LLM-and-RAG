I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for bird and amphibian vocalisation classification, including the use of pre-trained models, transfer learning, and training on less expensive hardware. However, it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
