I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of different deep learning models for algal bloom forecasting and their performance comparison. It discusses the experimental setup, model architectures, and results, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
