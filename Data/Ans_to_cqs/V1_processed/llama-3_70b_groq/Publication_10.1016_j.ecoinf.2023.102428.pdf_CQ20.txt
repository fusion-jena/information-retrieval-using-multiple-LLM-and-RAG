I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the MLPnn-MC model, its architecture, and performance, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
