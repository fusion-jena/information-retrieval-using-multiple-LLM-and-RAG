Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the overall framework of the PCF, including PSI generation, labeling, and classification, as well as the process of creating training and validation data. It does not provide specific details on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
