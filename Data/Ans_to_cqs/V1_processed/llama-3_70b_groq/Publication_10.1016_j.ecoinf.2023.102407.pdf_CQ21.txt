Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the training setup, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics for the Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and the proposed incremental Pseudo-Labeling (PL) approach.

However, it does mention the evaluation criteria for the AUC and TSS metrics in Table 5, which suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved. But it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.

Therefore, I can only confirm that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps, but I don't know about the other steps involved.
