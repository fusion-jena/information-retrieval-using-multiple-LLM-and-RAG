Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on drought assessment and prediction using deep learning models, specifically a hybrid CNN-LSTM approach. It discusses the architecture of the model, the dataset compilation, and the analysis of drought propagation times. However, it does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
