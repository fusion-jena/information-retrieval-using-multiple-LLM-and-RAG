I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecological niche models, and evaluation metrics for these models, but it does not mention deep learning specifically. The models mentioned, such as MaxEnt, Random Forest, and SVM, are traditional machine learning models, not deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine the purpose of a deep learning model from the provided context.
