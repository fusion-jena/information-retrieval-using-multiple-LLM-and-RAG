I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the methodology and results of the study, including the use of deep learning techniques for reconstructing damaged herbarium leaves and improving plant species identification. However, it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a specific repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
