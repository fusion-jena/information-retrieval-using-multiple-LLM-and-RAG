The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using four different metrics: test loss, mean squared error (MSE), mean average percentage error (MAPE), and accuracy (Acc). The accuracy of the regression tasks is calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it with the ground truth.
