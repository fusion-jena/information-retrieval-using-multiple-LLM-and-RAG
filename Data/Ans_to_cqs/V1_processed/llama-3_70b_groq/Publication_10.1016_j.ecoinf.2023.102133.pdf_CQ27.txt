Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the configuration and hyperparameters of the model, as well as the feature analysis and performance evaluation, but it does not provide information on the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
