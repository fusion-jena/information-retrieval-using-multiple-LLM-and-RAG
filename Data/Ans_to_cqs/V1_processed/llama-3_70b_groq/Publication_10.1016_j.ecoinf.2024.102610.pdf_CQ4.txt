I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to a study on predicting tsetse density using machine learning and deep learning approaches, but it does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques used. The references cited are related to machine learning and deep learning approaches, climate data, and tick collection, but they do not mention data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
