The context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process was stopped after a fixed number of iterations (4000) and epochs (200), rather than based on a specific criterion such as validation loss plateau. The graph illustrating the loss while training the neural network shows that the average loss is reduced to 0.54%, and the model improved swiftly in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision before plateauing after about 1000 iterations. However, it does not mention that the training was stopped due to the plateau.
