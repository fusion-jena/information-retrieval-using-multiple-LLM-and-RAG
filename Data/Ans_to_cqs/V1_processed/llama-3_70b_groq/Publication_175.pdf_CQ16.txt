Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses data augmentation and few-shots learning methods as solutions to the problem of limited data, and it presents some experimental results using a ResNet DL model. However, it does not provide information about the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
