Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, specifically the tuning of hyperparameters using a grid search approach, and the selection of the optimal parameters for the Random Forest model. It also discusses the data splitting strategy used for training and testing. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as the calculation of metrics, generation of saliency maps, or creation of a confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
