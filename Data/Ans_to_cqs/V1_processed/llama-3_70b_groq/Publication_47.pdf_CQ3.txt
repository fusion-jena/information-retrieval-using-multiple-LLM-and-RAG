The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The paper focuses on the development of a deep neural network algorithm (IUC-NN) to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species based on digitally available occurrence records. The features used in the model include geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic factors, but there is no mention of image-based data or annotation techniques. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline from the provided context.
