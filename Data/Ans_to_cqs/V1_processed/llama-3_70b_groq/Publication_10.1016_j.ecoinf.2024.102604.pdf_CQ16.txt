I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training completion criteria, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and bias correction in environmental spaces, but it does not provide information about machine learning training processes or completion criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
