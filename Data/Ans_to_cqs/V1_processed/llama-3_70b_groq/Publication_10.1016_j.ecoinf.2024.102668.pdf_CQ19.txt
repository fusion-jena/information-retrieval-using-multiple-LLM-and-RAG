I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only mentions the potential application of acoustic indices to fields like machine learning and deep learning, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
