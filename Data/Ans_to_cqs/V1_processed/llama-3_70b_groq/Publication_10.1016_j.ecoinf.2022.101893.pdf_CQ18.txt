Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the result analysis, feature selection, and the architecture of the proposed models. It discusses the division of datasets into training and test sets, the performance of different classification models on the test set, and the design of the proposed network. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
