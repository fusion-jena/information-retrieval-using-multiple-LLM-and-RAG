The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning techniques or optimization algorithms such as SGD or Adam. The context focuses on tuning the parameters of a machine learning model, specifically a decision tree-based ensemble model, using a grid search method. The optimization goal is to minimize the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to achieve the most accurate predictions. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
