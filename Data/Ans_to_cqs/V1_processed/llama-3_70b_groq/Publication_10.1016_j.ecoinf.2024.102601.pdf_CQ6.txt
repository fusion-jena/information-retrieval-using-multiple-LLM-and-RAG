Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, and it does not provide information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention optimizing data structures for ML classification, which might involve preprocessing steps. But the specific steps are not mentioned. Additionally, the context discusses selecting the most pertinent predictors from S2 imagery, which could involve some form of feature selection or engineering, but again, the specific preprocessing steps are not detailed.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
