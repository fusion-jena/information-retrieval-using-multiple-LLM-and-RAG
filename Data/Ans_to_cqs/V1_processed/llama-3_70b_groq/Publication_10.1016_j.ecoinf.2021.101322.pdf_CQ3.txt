I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the CNN training data, architecture, and references related to the project. It mentions the use of the EfficientNet architecture and pre-trained network weights, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
