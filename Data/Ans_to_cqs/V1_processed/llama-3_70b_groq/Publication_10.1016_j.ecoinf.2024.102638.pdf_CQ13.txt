The provided context does not explicitly mention a deep learning model. However, it does mention an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model, which is a type of neural network and can be considered a deep learning model.

The hyperparameters for the MLP model are listed as:

* hidden_layer_sizes
* activation
* alpha
* learning_rate
* max_iter

These hyperparameters are related to the architecture and training of the MLP model. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how quickly the model learns from the data. The activation function is used to introduce non-linearity in the model. The hidden_layer_sizes parameter determines the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer. The alpha parameter is related to regularization, and max_iter determines the maximum number of iterations for training the model.

Note that the context does not mention an optimizer, which is another important hyperparameter in deep learning models.
