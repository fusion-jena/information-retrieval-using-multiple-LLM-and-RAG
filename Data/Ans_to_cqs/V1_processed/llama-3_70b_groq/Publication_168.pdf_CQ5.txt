The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The context only mentions that the proposed methods achieved certain classification accuracies on three data sets, but it does not specify the names of these datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
