Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on explaining the SHAP values, LSTM model, and its application in forecasting ecological water demand. It does not provide information about the training process or performance monitoring strategies.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
