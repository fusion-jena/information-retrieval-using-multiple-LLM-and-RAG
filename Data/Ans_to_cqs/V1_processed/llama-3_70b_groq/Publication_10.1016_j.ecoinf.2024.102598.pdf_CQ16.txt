The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the evaluation and comparison of different machine learning models (MLMs) using various performance metrics, including AUC, TSS, Kappa, and phi. It also discusses the use of cross-validation and the calibration and validation of each model with optimized parameters. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when the training process is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
