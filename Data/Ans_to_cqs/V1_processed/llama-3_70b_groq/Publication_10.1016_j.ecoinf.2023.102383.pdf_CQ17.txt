Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of ResNet models, Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN), and their applications in object detection tasks. It discusses the advantages of using FPN with ResNet models for detecting small objects in UAV thermal images. However, it does not provide information about regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
