Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the parameter setting methods for SVM and SAE classifiers, as well as the classification performance assessment. It does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
