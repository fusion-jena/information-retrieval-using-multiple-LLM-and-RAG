The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the preprocessing steps, such as auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, and filtering, as well as data augmentation techniques like random saturation adjustments. It also mentions the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, including Precision, Recall, mAP, Params, FLOPs, Inference time, and Time. However, it does not specify the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
