The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and accuracy. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance on the UBD_45 and VP_200 datasets. 

According to the context, accuracy alone is not sufficient to evaluate the model's performance, especially since one of the datasets is imbalanced. Therefore, other metrics are used to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. 

The equations for these metrics are provided in the context, which are based on the number of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions. 

The sensitivity or recall measures the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified, while specificity measures the proportion of true negatives that are correctly identified. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, and F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
