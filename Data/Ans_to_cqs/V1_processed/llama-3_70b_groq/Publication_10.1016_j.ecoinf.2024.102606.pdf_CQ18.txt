The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that cross-validation is used to ensure the statistical results and prevent overfitting. Cross-validation involves training multiple models on different versions of the dataset and evaluating their performances. The similarity of each model's evaluation results would indicate the correctness of the model's predictions. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the precision and recall metrics are calculated, and a precision-recall curve is used to represent the balance between the two metrics. This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training using these metrics, but the specific strategy implemented is not clearly stated.
