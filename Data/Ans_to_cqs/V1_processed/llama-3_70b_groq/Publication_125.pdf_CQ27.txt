I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context provides information about the CNN architecture, data augmentation, execution time, and discussion about privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL) techniques. It also describes the architecture of VGG16 and ResNet-50 models. However, it does not provide information about model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
