Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are related to the validation phase. During this phase, the images of the validation split are divided into regularly-spaced, overlapping patches, using the same size employed during training. These patches are processed individually, and the overall output is reconstructed by combining the predictions from the patches. Subsequently, metrics are calculated over the complete image.

However, the context does not explicitly mention saliency maps, confusion matrix, or other specific postprocessing steps. It only mentions the calculation of metrics over the complete image, but it does not specify which metrics are calculated.

Additionally, for the solution based on detection, the context mentions that the final global output is reconstructed using non-maximum suppression among the bounding boxes. But it does not provide further information on other postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, but I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query.
