I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and training of the model, including the use of convolutional kernels, pooling layers, LSTM networks, and attention mechanisms. It also provides details on the hyperparameters used during training, such as the batch size, learning rate, and weight decay. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as whether model serialization was used or which platform was selected for deployment.
