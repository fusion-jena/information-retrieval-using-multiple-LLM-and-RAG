The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of the accuracy of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of this method are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Error of Commission (MEC). 

RMSE is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. MEC is calculated as the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values, normalized by the variance of the actual values.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of relative deviations of the accuracy estimates from their reference metrics, expressed as percentages. For example, the relative RMSE (rRMSE) is computed as the ratio of the estimated RMSE to the reference RMSE, multiplied by 100.

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used metrics in deep learning model evaluation.
