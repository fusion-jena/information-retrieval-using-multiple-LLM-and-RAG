The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model training, validation, and retraining process, as well as the importance of manual classification and quality checks.

However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated through quality checks, and if the performance is not satisfactory, the model is retrained with new training images. The context also mentions that the model output from the original model can be helpful in finding images that meet certain criteria, but it does not provide details on specific postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
