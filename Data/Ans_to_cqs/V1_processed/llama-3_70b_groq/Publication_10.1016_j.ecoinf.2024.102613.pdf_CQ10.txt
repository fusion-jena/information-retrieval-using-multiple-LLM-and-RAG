I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to precision agriculture, livestock farming, and IoT-based systems, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
