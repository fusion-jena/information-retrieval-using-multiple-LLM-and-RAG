I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of the librosa Python package, which has a documentation link (https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html), but it does not provide a link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline itself. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
