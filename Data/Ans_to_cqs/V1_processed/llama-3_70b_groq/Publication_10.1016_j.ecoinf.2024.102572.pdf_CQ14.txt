I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about a model or its hyperparameters, nor does it discuss optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. The context appears to be related to a formula for calculating combustible material load in forest fires, and it provides some information about the variables involved in the formula and their units. It does not provide any information about machine learning models or hyperparameter optimization.
