I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the application of deep learning in remote sensing, citing various research papers and conferences, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
