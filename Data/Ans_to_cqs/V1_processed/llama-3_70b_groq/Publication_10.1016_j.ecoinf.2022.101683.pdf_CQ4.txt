I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDMs) and discusses various treatments to test the impact of potential biases and errors, including random backgrounds, spatial filtering, targeted selection of background points, and weighted background points. However, it does not mention deep learning or any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
