The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the selection of the optimal sampling grid and discretization parameters for the OPGD data, but it does not provide information on the optimization of model hyperparameters.

However, it is mentioned that the "optidisc" function of the "GD" package in RStudio is used to select the optimal parameters for discretizing continuous data. This suggests that the optimal discretization parameters are determined using a specific method, but the context does not provide further details on how this is done.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention grid search or random search, which are common methods for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, it is unclear how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in this specific case.
