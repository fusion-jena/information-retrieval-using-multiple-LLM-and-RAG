The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the comparison of different machine learning models, their hyperparameters, and performance metrics. It mentions the use of 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy to tune hyperparameters within the training dataset, but it does not specify the stopping criterion for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
