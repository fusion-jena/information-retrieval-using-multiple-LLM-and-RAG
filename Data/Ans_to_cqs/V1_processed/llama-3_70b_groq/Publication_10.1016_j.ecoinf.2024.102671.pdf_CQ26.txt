I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, data bias, or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. The context appears to be related to ecological carbon sink risk assessment, landscape risks, and MCDA methods, but it does not provide information on deep learning or data preprocessing techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
