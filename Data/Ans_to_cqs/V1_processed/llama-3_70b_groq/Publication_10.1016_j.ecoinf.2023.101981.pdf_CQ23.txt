Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the model's performance in detecting cow vocalizations and compares it with another study. It discusses the FFT window size, frequency settings, and model parameters, but it does not provide information on the dataset's diversity or the model's evaluation methodology. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
