The pipeline uses a Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture, as well as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. These are mentioned as the best-performing models in the text, with model 12 having a DeepConvLSTM architecture and model 14 having a CNN architecture.
