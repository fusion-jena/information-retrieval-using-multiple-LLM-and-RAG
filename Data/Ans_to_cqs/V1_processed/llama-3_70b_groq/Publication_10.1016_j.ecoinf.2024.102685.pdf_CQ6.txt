The provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context discusses the workflow adopted for data acquisition, preparation, and setting up Random Forest (RF) models for seagrass species classification. It mentions the removal of non-vegetated and mixed pixels, and the points not falling within the region of interest (ROI) to reduce the effects introduced by these points. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning for deep learning models.

Since the context does not provide the required information, I don't know the answer to this query.
