Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on presenting the results of the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and kappa coefficient, as well as providing information about the study area, forest types, and fire risk classification. 

There is no mention of the dataset used to train the model, whether it was diverse or not, or if cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques were employed to ensure the model's generalizability. The authors do mention that their study was constrained by limitations in resources and time, which resulted in a narrow focus on specific forest samples, but they do not provide further details on how they addressed these limitations.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
