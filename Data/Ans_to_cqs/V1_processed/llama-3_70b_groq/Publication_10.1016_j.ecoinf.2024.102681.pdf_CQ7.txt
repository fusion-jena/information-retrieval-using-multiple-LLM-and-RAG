Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, its architecture, and its application to drought propagation time and influencing factors. It discusses the improvement in prediction accuracy after introducing the hybrid model and the compilation of a comprehensive dataset for the study. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation purposes. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
