I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to habitat classification and mapping, discussing different types of habitats, such as broadleaved woodland, grasslands, and wetlands, and referencing studies on habitat mapping using EO-data. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in image processing and computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
