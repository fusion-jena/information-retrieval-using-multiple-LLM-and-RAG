I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a model for environmental condition classification, and it provides information about the model's performance on different environmental conditions, as well as specifications of various CPU/microprocessor models. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or another method is used to optimize the hyperparameters.
