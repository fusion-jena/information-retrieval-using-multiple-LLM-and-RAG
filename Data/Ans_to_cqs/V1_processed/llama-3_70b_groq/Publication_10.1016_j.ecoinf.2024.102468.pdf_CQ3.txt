The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the analysis of annotations within a library, specifically mentioning the number of manual detections for different types of calls (Bm-Ant-A and Bm-Ant-Z). It also references an open-access data and annotation library (IWC-SORP/SOOS annotated library). However, it does not specify the annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
