I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a study on ecological informatics, and it provides tables and results related to performance measures and detection thresholds, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or any other method is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
