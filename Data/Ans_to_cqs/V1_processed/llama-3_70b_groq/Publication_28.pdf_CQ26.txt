The provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the structure and training of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
