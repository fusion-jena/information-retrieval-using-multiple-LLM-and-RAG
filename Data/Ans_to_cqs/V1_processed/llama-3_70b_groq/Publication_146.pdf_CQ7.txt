Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the training evaluation of a model, discussing the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU, and mAP. It also mentions the creation of a custom dataset for the project, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

In general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Common practices include random splitting, stratified splitting, or using techniques like k-fold cross-validation. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact criteria used in this particular case.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
