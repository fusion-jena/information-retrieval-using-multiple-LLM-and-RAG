Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning methods in ecology and sustainable natural resource management, particularly in predicting the occurrence of pine wilt disease. It discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, including random forest, maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), and ensemble models, but does not delve into the preprocessing steps required for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this context.
