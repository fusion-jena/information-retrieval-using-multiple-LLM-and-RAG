I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification, remote sensing, and random forest classification, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
