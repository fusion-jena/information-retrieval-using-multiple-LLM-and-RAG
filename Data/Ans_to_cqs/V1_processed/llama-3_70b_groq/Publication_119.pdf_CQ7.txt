The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that "independent testing data, i.e., same for all models, is used for model evaluation" in the Accuracy Assessment section. This implies that the data was split into training and testing sets, but the specific criteria or ratio for this split is not provided. Additionally, there is no mention of a validation set.
