The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "weight decay to 5 Ã— 10^(-2)" in section 2.5.2, which suggests that L2 regularization (also known as weight decay) is used as a regularization method. There is no mention of dropout or other regularization methods.
