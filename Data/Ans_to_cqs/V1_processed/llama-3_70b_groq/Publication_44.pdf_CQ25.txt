The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the context, which mentions "a fully convolution neural network for semantic segmentation" and "produce the final segmentation results". Additionally, the model is described as consisting of an encoder part that extracts features and a decoder part that up-samples the feature map to produce the final segmentation results. This is a typical architecture for semantic segmentation tasks, where the goal is to assign a class label to each pixel in an image.
