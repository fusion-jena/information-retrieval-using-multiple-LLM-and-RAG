Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for the Pl@ntNet classification tool. This is evident from the mention of the CNN architecture being used for image classification and the API accepting one to five images of a plant as input. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if other data formats like audio, video, or CSV are used in the pipeline. Therefore, it can be concluded that image data formats are used, but the use of other formats is unknown.
