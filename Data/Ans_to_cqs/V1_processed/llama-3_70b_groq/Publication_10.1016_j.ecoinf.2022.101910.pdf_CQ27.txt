I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context primarily focuses on the application of automated signal recognition software, specifically BirdNET, for monitoring vocally active taxa and the use of AudioMoth for passive acoustic monitoring. It does not provide details on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
