I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and remote sensing for detecting artisanal small-scale mining, Amazonian rainforest phenology, and other environmental topics. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks, cloud-based machine learning, and semi-automated reclassification, but does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
