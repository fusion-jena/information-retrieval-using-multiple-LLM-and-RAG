I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily discusses artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their applications in remote sensing and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
