I don't know.

The provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to image acquisition and processing, and it mentions tasks such as writing, visualization, validation, software, resources, project administration, methodology, investigation, formal analysis, data curation, and conceptualization. It also provides some numerical values and equations, but it does not provide information about postprocessing steps involved in model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
