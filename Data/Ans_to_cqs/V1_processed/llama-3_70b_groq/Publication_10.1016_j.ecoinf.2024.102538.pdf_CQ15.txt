The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Adam optimizer. This is mentioned in the context as "The model was trained over 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer". Additionally, the learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs, with a minimum learning rate established at 1 Ã— 10^-5.
