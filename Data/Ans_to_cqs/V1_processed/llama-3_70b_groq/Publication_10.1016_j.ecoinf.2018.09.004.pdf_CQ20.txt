I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning models or the hardware resources used for training them. The context appears to be discussing a supervised learning approach for seagrass detection in the Mediterranean, and it mentions various machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. However, it does not provide any information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
