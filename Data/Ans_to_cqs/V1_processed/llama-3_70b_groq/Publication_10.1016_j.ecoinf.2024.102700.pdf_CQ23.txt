Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing a review of ecological modeling approaches, including correlative modeling and Maxent, but it does not specifically address deep learning models or their generalizability.

The context does mention validation methods, but it does not provide details on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. It only mentions that some studies used internal validation strategies, while others used external validation methods, and a significant number did not provide clear information on their validation approach.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
