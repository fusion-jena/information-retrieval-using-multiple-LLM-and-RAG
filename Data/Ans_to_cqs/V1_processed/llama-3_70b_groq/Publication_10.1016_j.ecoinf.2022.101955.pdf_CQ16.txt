The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the validation dataset is used to check the final model accuracy. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation dataset is used to determine when training is complete. 

It is common in machine learning to use metrics such as validation loss or validation accuracy to determine when training is complete. For example, if the validation loss plateaus or the validation accuracy reaches a certain threshold, training may be considered complete. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
