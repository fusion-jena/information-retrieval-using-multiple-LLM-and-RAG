Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters determined using grid search, model performance, and the potential of using deep learning technologies on IoT edge devices for wildlife monitoring.

However, it can be inferred that the models were pre-initialized with ImageNet weights, which suggests that the dataset might have undergone some preprocessing steps to be compatible with the pre-trained models. Additionally, the context mentions that the data is highly unbalanced, which might require techniques like SMOTE for data balancing.

But, specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.
