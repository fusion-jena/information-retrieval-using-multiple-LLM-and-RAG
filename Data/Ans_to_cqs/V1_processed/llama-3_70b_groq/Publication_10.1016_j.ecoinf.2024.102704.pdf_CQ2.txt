Based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from the various papers and research studies that focus on image-based applications, such as fish size monitoring, fish detection, and fish biomass estimation. These studies utilize image data from underwater videos, cameras, or other sources to train and test their deep learning models.

There is no explicit mention of audio data being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible that audio data might be used in certain applications, such as acoustic monitoring of marine life, but this is not evident from the provided context.

Video data is also mentioned in some studies, particularly in the context of underwater video monitoring for fish size monitoring and fish biomass estimation. However, it is not clear if video data is used as a primary input format for the deep learning models or if it is converted into image frames for processing.

There is no mention of CSV (Comma Separated Values) data format being used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV is typically used for tabular data, and the applications mentioned in the context seem to focus on image and video data.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline appears to be image data, with some studies also utilizing video data.
