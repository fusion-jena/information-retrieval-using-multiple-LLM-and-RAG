I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to environmental topics, including water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and wastewater treatment. It also includes some data tables and references to research papers, but it does not provide information about optimization techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
