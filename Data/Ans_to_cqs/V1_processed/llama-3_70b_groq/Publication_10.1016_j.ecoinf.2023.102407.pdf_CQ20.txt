I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the methodology and setup of species distribution models (SDMs) and the evaluation of their performance, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
