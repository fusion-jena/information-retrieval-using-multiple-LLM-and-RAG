Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the experiment's methodology, including the selection of the LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework, and references to other studies. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that were performed after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
