According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Image augmentation: This involves applying transformations to the input images, such as horizontal flip, 0.2 degree counter-clockwise shear, and a random zoom between 0 and 0.2.

2. Normalization: The data was normalized to ImageNet mean values.

3. Rescaling: The pixel values were rescaled in the range of [0, 1].

No mention of cleaning is made in the provided context, so it is unclear if any cleaning steps were performed.
