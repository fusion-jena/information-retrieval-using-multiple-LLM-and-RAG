The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is YOLO (You Only Look Once), which is a family of object detection models. Specifically, five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family are used, including YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x. These models are built on the PyTorch machine learning framework and are used for detecting objects, in this case, alates on sorghum leaves. Although CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are mentioned in the context as a type of deep neural network used for pattern recognition in insect images, they are not explicitly mentioned as part of the pipeline.
