The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context mentions the use of machine learning models, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), but it does not specify whether MLP is a part of the deep learning model or not. It also mentions the use of other models such as CatBoost, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, but these are not typically considered deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
