I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the use of pre-trained CNN models (VGGish, BirdNET, and Wav2Vec 2.0) for extracting embeddings from audio data, and the conversion of waveforms to Mel-spectrograms as a signal representation. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
