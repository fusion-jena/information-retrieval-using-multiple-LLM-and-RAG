Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the experimental design, hyperparameter settings, and limitations of the current approach. It discusses the various experimental configurations, training mechanisms, and dataset types used, but it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
