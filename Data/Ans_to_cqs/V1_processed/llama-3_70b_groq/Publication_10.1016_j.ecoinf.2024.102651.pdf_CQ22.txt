Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, other metrics such as AP (Average Precision), CIoU (Complete Intersection over Union), WIoU (Weighted Intersection over Union), SIoU (Soft Intersection over Union), EIoU (Enhanced Intersection over Union), and Î±-IoU (Alpha Intersection over Union) are also mentioned. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of object classification and object detection tasks.
