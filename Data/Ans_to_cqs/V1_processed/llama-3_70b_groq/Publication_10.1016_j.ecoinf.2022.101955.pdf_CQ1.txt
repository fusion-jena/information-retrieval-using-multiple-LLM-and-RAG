The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing data is used as the primary source of data. This is evident from the references to remote sensing data in the context, such as in the paper titles "Geological mapping using remote sensing data" and "A comparison of pixel-based and object-based image analysis with selected machine learning algorithms for the classification of agricultural landscapes using SPOT-5 HRG imagery". 

Remote sensing data can be collected through various methods, including satellite imagery, aerial photography, and sensors mounted on aircraft or drones. However, the specific method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
