Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning models (SLSTM and SGRU) is time-series prediction. Specifically, they are used for forecasting sales volume of agricultural products and predicting the Pacific decadal oscillation index at multiple time scales. The goal is to mitigate production risks and facilitate agricultural planning by accurately predicting sales volume before production, and to minimize post-production price fluctuations.
