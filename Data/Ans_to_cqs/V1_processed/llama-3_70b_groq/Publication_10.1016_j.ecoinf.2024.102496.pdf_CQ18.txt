I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a research article about stormwater management, nutrient removal, and environmental justice. It discusses various concepts such as best management practices (BMPs), environmental equity, and decision support tools, but it does not provide information about model training or performance monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
