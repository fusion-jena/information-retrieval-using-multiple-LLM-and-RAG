The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are presented in Table 6, which shows the overall accuracies, precisions, recalls, and F1-scores of the five networks (VGG16, Inceptionv3, ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101).
