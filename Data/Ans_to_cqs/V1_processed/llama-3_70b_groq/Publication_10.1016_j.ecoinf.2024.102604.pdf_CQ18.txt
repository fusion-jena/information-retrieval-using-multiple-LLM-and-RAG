I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses model evaluation using two indicators, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Î”D, to assess the effectiveness of each model in correcting sampling bias. It also discusses various methods to address sampling bias, such as geographic filtering, representativeness-oriented methods, and environmental variability. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
