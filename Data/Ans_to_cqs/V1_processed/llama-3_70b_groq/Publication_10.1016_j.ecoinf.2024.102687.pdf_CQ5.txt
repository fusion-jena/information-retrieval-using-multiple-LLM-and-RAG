The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are ImageNet and Darksound. ImageNet is a large and general dataset containing 1000 object classes with 1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 test images. It is used to pre-train the CNN backbones such as ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet. The Darksound dataset is used for fine-tuning the pre-trained models. There is also a mention of bird sound datasets, which are smaller but more specific datasets that can be used for feature extraction, but the specific names of these datasets are not provided. There is no mention of MNIST or CIFAR datasets in the context.
