The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This is explicitly stated in the text: "This paper proposes a water quality monitoring system based on a deep learning model, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model..."
