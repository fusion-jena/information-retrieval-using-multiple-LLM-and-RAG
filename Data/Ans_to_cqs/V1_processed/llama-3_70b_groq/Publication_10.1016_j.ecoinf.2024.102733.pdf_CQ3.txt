The provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the training process of an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) using features extracted from an Autoencoder model, and the various hyperparameters and regularization techniques explored during the training process. There is no mention of data annotation techniques, which are typically used to label and prepare data for training machine learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
