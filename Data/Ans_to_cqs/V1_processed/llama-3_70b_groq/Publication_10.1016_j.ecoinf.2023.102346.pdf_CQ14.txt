Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of different machine learning algorithms, ensemble modeling approaches, and statistical analysis, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
