The pipeline uses a combination of deep learning models, including Transformer and CNN-LSTM. Specifically, the Wav2Vec model, which is a type of Transformer, is used for automatic speech recognition and audio-related problems. Additionally, the Hybrid CNN-LSTM model is mentioned as a baseline model that combines the strengths of CNNs and LSTMs for learning spatial and temporal data.
