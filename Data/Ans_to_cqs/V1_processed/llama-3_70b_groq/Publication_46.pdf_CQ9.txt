Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context only mentions that supplementary materials, including a table with methodology details, are available online at a specific URL (https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/rs13163284/s1). However, it does not provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
