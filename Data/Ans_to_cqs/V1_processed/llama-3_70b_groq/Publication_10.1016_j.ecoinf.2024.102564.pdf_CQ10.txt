I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context appears to be a list of academic papers and articles related to forest dynamics, ecology, and machine learning, but it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
