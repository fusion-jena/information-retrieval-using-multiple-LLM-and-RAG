The platform used to deploy the deep learning model is not specified in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe. This suggests that Caffe, a deep learning framework, was used to train the model, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
