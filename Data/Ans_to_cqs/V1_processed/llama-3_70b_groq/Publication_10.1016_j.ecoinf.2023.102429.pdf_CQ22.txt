The provided context does not mention a deep learning model. It discusses the evaluation of models for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations using techniques such as Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR). The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy and validity of the models. There is no mention of deep learning models or metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.
