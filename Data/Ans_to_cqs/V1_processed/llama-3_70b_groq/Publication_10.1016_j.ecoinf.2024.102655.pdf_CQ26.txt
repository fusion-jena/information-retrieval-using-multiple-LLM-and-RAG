The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that the dataset was subjected to an outlier detection and artificial data replacement process, as reported by Casillas-Garc√≠a et al. (2021). However, it does not provide information on techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias in this context.
