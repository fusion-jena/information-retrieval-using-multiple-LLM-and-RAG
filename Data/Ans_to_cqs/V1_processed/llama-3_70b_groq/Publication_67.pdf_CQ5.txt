The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context suggests that the datasets are created from satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources, which are not specified. The datasets are designed to have examples of images with different levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and an auxiliary class "Non-Forest". Additionally, the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset is mentioned as one of the sources of image data. The datasets are used to train Inception v.3 models for tree cover classification in global drylands.
