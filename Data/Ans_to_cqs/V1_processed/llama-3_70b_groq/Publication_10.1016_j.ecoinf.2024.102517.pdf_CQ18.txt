The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the calculation of the loss value, which is used to update the model parameters during backpropagation. The loss value is calculated as the difference between the feature activations of the clean bird sound signal and the processed bird sound signal generated by the noise reduction network. This loss value is used to adjust the model parameters to minimize the difference between the clean and processed signals. However, the exact strategy or metric used to monitor the model performance during training is not specified in the provided context.
