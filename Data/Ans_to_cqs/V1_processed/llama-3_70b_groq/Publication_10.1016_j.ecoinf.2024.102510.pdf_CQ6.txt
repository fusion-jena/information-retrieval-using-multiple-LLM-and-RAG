Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different pre-trained models, hyperparameter tuning, and the experimental results. It does not provide information about the preprocessing steps that were taken before training the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
