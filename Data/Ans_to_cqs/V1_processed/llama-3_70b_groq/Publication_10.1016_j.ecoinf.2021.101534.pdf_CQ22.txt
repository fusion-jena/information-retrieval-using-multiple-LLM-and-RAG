The performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model in this context include the area under the ROC curve (AUC), average precision (AP) for each sound class, mean average precision (mAP) for the overall model, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are calculated using the scikit-learn package. The AP values for different classes range from 0.49 to 0.96, and the mAP is 0.83.
