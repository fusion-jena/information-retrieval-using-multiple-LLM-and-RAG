The data augmentation techniques applied in the DeepLabV3+ model training process are:

(i) Flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis;
(ii) Exchanging between multiple image channels while the labels remain unchanged;
(iii) Randomly rotating the images and labels by 90Â°;
(iv) Randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged.

These techniques are used to enhance the training set and improve the model's robustness to different image variations.
