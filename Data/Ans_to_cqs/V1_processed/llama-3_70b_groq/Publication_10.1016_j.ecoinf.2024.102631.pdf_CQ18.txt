The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE on different datasets (C-60, U45, and UCCS). The model's effectiveness is also confirmed through a quantitative analysis given in Table 5.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a loss function (Ltotal) that combines adversarial loss, L1 loss, and perceptual loss. This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training by tracking these loss functions. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance is not explicitly stated.
