The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study used aerial images of KNP (Kruger National Park) taken about every two years, which suggests that the raw data might be collected through aerial imaging or remote sensing. Additionally, the context mentions the use of sampling plots to collect training and validation points, which implies that some form of field data collection might be involved. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context.
