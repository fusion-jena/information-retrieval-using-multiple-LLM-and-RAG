Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to machine learning and ecology, but it does not provide specific information on addressing data bias.

However, I can provide general information on the techniques you mentioned. Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are common techniques used to address class imbalance and data bias in machine learning. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class.

Diverse data collection is also an important technique to address data bias by collecting data from diverse sources, environments, and populations to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the population.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, I cannot provide a more detailed answer on how these techniques are used in the context of deep learning pipelines.
