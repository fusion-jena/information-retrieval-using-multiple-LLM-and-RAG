The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on Zenodo. This is mentioned in reference 23, which states "Naud√© JJ, Joubert D. The aerial elephant dataset Zenodo. 2019. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3234780." This reference indicates that the aerial elephant dataset, which is likely the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline, is hosted on Zenodo.
