Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for acoustic detection of Northern Bobwhite calls and provides details on the study area, data collection, and model parameters. 

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset collected over three years (2016-2018) at a specific location (Di-Lane Plantation WMA, Burke County, Georgia), which might limit the model's generalizability to other locations or environments. The context does not mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the model's generalizability. 

It is possible that the researchers may have employed such measures, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, it is unclear what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
