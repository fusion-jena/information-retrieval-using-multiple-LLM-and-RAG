Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image classification, including the layers and tensor/vector shapes. It also provides information about the notebooks used to define and train the CNNs, but it does not discuss data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
