The context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset was split into training (80%) and testing sets (20%). This suggests that the data was split into two sets, one for training the model and the other for testing its performance. There is no mention of a validation set, which is typically used to tune hyperparameters during the training process.
