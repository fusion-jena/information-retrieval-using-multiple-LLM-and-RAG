Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Accuracy: This is mentioned in the text as "Total accuracy" and "User's accuracy" in the confusion matrices (Tables 2 and 3). Accuracy is a measure of how well the model is able to correctly classify burned and non-burned areas.

2. Producer's accuracy: This is also mentioned in the confusion matrices, which is a measure of how well the model is able to correctly classify a particular class (burned or non-burned).

No other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that only accuracy and producer's accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study.
