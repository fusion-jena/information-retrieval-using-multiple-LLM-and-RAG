Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the model performance evaluation, hyperparameter optimization, and comparison of different machine learning models (RF, GBDT, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost) for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity in Nansi Lake using Sentinel-2 imagery.

There is no mention of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
