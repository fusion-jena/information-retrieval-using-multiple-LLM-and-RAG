I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be discussing a research paper or study on assessing the accuracy of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method, specifically focusing on Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) predictions. The context mentions various datasets, figures, and sampling methods, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
