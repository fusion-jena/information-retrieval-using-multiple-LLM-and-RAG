I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses segmentation scales and parameters, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other optimization method. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
