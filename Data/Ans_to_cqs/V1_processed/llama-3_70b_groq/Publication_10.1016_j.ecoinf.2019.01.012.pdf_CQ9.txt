I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification, and provides details on the training process and architecture of the CNN model. However, it does not provide information on where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
