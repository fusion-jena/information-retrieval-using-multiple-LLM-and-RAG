I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository. The context appears to be a collection of references related to machine learning, vegetation studies, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about a specific pipeline or its data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
