Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on explaining the concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolution operations, and pooling layers, as well as providing information about the authors and funding of a research paper. It does not provide any information about data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
