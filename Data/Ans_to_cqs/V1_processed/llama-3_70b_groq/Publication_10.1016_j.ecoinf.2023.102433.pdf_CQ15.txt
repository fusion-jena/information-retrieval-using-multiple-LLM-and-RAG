I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses the NASA Web Service API Provider class, its methods, and their parameters, as well as the limitations and workarounds for dealing with large volumes of requests. It also mentions that Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a SaaS that uses TensorFlow for deep learning analysis, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
