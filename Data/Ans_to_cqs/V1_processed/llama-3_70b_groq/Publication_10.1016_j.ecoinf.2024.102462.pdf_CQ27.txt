Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process, explaining how the model is trained using annotated data and optimized to capture statistics and relationships from the data. It also discusses the importance of a large and accurate dataset for developing a model that can match human expertise.

The context does mention that once the training process is finished, the model is ready to process new unseen data, and it can be evaluated on an independent dataset (testing data set) to assess its generalization power. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model is deployed or what steps are taken to prepare it for real-world applications.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
