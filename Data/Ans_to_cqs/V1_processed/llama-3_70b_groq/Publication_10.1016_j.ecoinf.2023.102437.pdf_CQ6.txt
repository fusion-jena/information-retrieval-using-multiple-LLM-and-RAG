The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the "signature method" which is used to transform the time series data. This transformation is used to obtain 1885 terms, which are then used as inputs to the machine learning model.

Additionally, the context mentions "preselection of predictors" which can reduce computation time and the risk of overfitting. This suggests that some form of feature selection or dimensionality reduction may be involved in the preprocessing step.

However, it does not provide information on other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
