I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the choice of FFT window size and its effect on frequency resolution, as well as the differences in detecting cow vocalizations between the current study and Karmiris et al. (2021). However, it does not provide information on the optimization method used for the model's hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search.
