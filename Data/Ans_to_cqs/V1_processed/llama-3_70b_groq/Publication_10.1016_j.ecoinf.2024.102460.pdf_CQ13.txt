I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context only discusses the LSTM model as a deep learning model used for time series forecasting, but it does not provide any information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
