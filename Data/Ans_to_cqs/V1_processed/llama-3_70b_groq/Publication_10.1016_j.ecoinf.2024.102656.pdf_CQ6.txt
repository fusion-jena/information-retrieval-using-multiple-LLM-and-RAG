The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling using ensemble methods and statistical models, including generalized linear models, maximum entropy, random forest, generalized boosting model, and multivariate adaptive regression lines. 

It discusses the methodology for combining forecasts from multiple models, generating pseudo-absence points, and evaluating model performance using metrics such as AUC and TSS. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
