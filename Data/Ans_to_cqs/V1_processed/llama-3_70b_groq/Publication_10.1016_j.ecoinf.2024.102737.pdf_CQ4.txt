The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are:

* Adding Gaussian noise in the range 0 to 255*0.2 to create more low-resolution resembling images.
* Sea waves distortion with alpha = 50 and sigma = 9 to create more images where sea waves effect is reflected.
* Blurring effect in the range (0.75, 1.5) to create more unclear images.

Note that rotations are not included in these techniques, as they were examined separately for handling different poses. Also, flipping and scaling are not mentioned as part of the data augmentation techniques used in this pipeline.
