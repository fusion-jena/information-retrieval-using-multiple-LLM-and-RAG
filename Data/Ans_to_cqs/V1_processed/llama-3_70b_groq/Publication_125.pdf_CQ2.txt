Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from the mention of satellite images in the context, as well as the discussion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are commonly used for image-based data processing. Additionally, the input shape of the CNN architecture provided in Table 3 is 128 × 128 × 3, which suggests that the input data is a 3-channel image (e.g., RGB). There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV in the provided context.
