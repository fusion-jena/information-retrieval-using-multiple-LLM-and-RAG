Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the general process of model training, the importance of validation data, and the application of deep learning methods to biological problems, particularly in insect ecoinformatics. It does not provide details on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
