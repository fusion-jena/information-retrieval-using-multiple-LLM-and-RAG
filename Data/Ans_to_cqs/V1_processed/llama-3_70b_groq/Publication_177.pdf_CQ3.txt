Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning models and their performance metrics for plant species identification tasks. It discusses different architectures, such as GoogleNet, ResNet, and ResNeXT, and their ensemble methods, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
