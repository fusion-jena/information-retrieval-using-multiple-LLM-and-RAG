According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement over the validation set. This is mentioned in the text as "early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement (over the validation set)" when describing the setup for training the EF and SN models. This implies that the training process is stopped when the validation loss plateaus or stops improving for 10 consecutive epochs.
