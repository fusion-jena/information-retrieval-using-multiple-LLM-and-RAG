I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its purpose. The text appears to be discussing forestry and ecological informatics, specifically focusing on estimators and equations related to tree sampling and diversity indices. There is no mention of deep learning or any related concepts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
