I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the configuration and training of an LSTM model for air quality prediction, including the loss function, optimization algorithm, and regularization method used. It also mentions the preprocessing of the dataset using a MinMaxScaler and the comparison of the LSTM model with other RNN architectures. However, it does not provide any information about data annotation techniques.
