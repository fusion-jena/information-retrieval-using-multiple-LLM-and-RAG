I don't know.

The provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily discusses few-shot sound event detection, prototypical networks, and template matching, but it does not address the specific topic of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.
