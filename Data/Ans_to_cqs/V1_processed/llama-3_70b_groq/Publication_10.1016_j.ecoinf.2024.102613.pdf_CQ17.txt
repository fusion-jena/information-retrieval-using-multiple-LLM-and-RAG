Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses data preprocessing, data analytics, and advanced analytics techniques such as geospatial analysis, mathematical models, statistical analysis, deep learning, and machine learning. However, it does not provide information on specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
