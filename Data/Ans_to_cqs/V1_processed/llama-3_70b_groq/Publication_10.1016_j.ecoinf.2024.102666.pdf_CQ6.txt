Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on atmospheric correction and aerosol types in the context of remote sensing and satellite imagery. It discusses various algorithms and models used for atmospheric correction, such as FLAASH and L2gen, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
