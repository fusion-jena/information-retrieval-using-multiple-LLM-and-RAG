The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context only discusses the model training parameters, such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs, but it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
