I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. It discusses the importance of good availability and quality of data at adequate scales for Species Distribution Models (SDMs), but it does not provide information on how this data is collected. It mentions that SDMs are heavily dependent on data, but it does not specify the methods used to collect this data, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
