I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context discusses the use of Random Forests, Generalized Boosting Models, and Artificial Neural Networks for downscaling climate data, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used to train these models.
