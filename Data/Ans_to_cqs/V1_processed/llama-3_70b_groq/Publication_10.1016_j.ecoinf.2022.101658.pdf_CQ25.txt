The purpose of the deep learning model is semantic segmentation. This is evident from the text, which mentions "semantic segmentation training and testing" and "DCNN semantic segmentation algorithm". Semantic segmentation is a type of image analysis task where the model is trained to classify each pixel in an image into a specific class or category. In this case, the model is being used to classify fuel types in images.
