I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the architecture of the neural network, the pre-training process, and the data pre-processing steps, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
