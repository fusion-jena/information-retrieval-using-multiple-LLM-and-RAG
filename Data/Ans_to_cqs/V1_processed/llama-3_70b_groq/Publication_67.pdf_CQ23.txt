The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a diverse dataset, which includes images from different sources such as Google, Maxar, and NWPU-RESISC45 dataset. This diversity in the dataset could help in improving the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained with different sampling design strategies, including continuous and discrete strategies, which could also contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

In summary, while the diversity of the dataset and the use of different sampling design strategies could contribute to the model's generalizability, the context does not provide explicit information on the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting.
