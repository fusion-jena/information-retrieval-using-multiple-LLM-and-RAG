The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. It appears to be discussing a study on invasive alien species, and the methods used are related to statistical modeling, not deep learning. The text mentions calculating the relative importance of predictor variables, plotting response curves, and using 30 repetitions to obtain a median variable importance score. There is no mention of measures to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
