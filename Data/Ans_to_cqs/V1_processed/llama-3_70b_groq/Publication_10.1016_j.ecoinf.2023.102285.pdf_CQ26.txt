Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the methodology, datasets, and results of a specific study, but it does not delve into the details of data preprocessing or bias handling.

However, it is worth noting that the study does mention the use of bespoke semi-supervised ML approaches, such as SelfMatch, which can be used to address certain types of research questions. Additionally, the study discusses the importance of evaluating the model with a completely new dataset independent from the first and second datasets to ensure the model's viability. This could be seen as a way to mitigate overfitting, which can be related to data bias.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
