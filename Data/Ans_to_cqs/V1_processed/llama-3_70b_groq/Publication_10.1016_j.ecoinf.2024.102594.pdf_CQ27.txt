I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the model training process, including the use of the ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler, data augmentation, and cropping of images into blocks. It also provides information about the DeepLabV3+ algorithm and its architecture. However, it does not provide any information about model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
