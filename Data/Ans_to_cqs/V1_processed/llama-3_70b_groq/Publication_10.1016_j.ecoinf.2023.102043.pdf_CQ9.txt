I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline data is stored. It mentions the use of a PostgreSQL database version 9.2.24 for storing annotations and audio files, but it does not provide information about a public data repository where the data is shared. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
