The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors combine data from a broad and diverse range of databases, such as EMODnet, UNEP, and CMEMS, to examine the presence-absence of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean Sea. 

It can be inferred that the authors utilize public datasets from these databases as a source of raw data. However, it is not clear if they also use surveys or sensors to collect data. The context does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data.
