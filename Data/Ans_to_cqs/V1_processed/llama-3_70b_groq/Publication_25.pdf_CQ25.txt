The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is object detection, specifically tree detection. This is evident from the mention of "Deep Learning RGB detection" and the use of a one-stage detector called Retinanet, which is a type of convolutional neural network designed for object detection tasks. The model is intended to detect trees in images, likely from remote sensing data, and generate bounding boxes around the detected trees.
