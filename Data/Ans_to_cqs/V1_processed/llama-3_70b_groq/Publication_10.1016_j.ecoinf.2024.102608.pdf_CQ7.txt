The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that the algorithms' performance and parameter settings were assessed using a training and test set approach. This implies that the data was split into at least two sets: a training set and a test set. 

There is no mention of a validation set or the criteria used to split the data into these sets. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
