The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the model's fit to the observed data is assessed using the R2 metric, and that the training process employs the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. It does not mention a specific stopping criterion such as validation loss plateau.
