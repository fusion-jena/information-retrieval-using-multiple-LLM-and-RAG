The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for forest classification, where the target classes are "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian", designated as "p", "w", and "r" respectively. The model is trained on 2D point cloud images to classify them into one of these three classes.
