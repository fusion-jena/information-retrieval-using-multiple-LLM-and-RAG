Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from weather stations based at four locations (Faridkot, Sriganganagar, Sirsa, and Hisar). The weather parameters recorded from 2011 to 2019 include minimum, maximum, and average temperature, standard meteorological week (SMW)-wise growing degree days (GDD), minimum relative humidity (RHmini.), maximum relative humidity (RHmax.), average relative humidity (RHave.), cumulative rainfall (mm), and whitefly per three leaves. 

It does not mention the use of surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data. Instead, it suggests that sensors or weather stations are used to collect the weather parameters and other relevant data.
