Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the pipeline is image data, specifically Sentinel-2 images. These images are downloaded from the European Space Agency ESA's Copernicus Open Access Hub and are used for spectral modeling and classification using the Random Forest (RF) technique. The images are resampled at 10m-pixel-1 using the Sentinels Application Platform v.6.0.4 (SNAP-ESA) free, open-source software. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. CSV format is also not explicitly mentioned, but it is possible that the data is stored or processed in CSV format at some point, although this is not explicitly stated.
