According to the provided context, the data is split into 5 folds for 5-fold cross-validation. For identifying the best training epoch for the CNN model, 1 of the 4 training folds is used as a validation set, and the model is trained on the remaining 3 folds. This implies that the data is split into training and validation sets, but there is no explicit mention of a test set. However, it can be inferred that the remaining fold (not used for validation) might be used as a test set, but this is not explicitly stated.
