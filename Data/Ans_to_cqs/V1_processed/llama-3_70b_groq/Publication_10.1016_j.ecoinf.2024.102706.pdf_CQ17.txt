The provided context does not specifically mention deep learning pipeline or methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning. However, it does discuss regularization methods used in Enet algorithm, which is a combination of lasso and ridge regression.

The Enet algorithm uses L1 and L2 penalties to remove or shrink predictors that do not affect reducing the sum of square error (SSE). The L1 penalty is used in lasso regression, and the L2 penalty is used in ridge regression. The Enet algorithm aggregates these penalties to form a linear regularization method.

Although the context does not mention dropout, which is a regularization method commonly used in deep learning, it does mention L2 regularization, which is used in ridge regression and Enet algorithm.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the regularization methods mentioned are L1 and L2 penalties, which are used in Enet algorithm to prevent overfitting. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods specifically used in deep learning pipeline.
