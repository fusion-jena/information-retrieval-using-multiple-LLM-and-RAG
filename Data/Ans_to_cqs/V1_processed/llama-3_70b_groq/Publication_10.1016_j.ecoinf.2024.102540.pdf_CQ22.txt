The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study are precision, mean average precision (mAP@0.5), recall, and mean percent error of misdetection. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate detector models, as mentioned in the context. The precision metric measures the percentage of correct positive predictions, while the mAP@0.5 measures the accuracy of object detection models using an Intersection-over-union measure set to 0.5. The recall metric shows how successfully a model can make correct detection predictions out of all the predictions it should make.
