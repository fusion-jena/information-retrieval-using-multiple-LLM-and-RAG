I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that a DeepMeerkat executable for Mac and Windows is available, and reproducible scripts for local and Google cloud environments are provided, but it does not specify a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
