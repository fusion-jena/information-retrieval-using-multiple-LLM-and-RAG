I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be discussing a NASA web service API provider class and its methods, as well as the deployment of a virtual machine (VM) with a Python 3.9 release and the execution of nasawebservice processes. There is no mention of a deep learning model or its deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
