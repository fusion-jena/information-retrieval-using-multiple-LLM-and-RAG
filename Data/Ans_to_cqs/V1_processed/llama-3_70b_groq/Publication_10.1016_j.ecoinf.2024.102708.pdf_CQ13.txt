I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only discusses the different object detection models used, such as YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and their variants, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used to train these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
