The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not a traditional computer vision dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it is a dataset of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe, which was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge. The dataset is likely composed of Earth observation data, possibly from Sentinel-2, given the mention of it in the keywords. The specific characteristics of the dataset, such as its format and content, are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
