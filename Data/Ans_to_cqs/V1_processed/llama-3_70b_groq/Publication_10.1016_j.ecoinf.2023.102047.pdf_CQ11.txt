I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and descriptions of various deep learning models and techniques, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository or a link to one. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
