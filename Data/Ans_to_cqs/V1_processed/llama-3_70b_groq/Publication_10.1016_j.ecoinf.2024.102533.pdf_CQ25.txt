The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the text, it can be inferred that the model is used for classification, specifically for automatically classifying fish freshness. The model uses six organoleptic parameters and applies them to seven fish species to determine the freshness class of the fish. The clustering process is used to group similar data into clusters, and the number of clusters determines the number of freshness classes. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model is used for classification, but the exact purpose is not clearly stated.
