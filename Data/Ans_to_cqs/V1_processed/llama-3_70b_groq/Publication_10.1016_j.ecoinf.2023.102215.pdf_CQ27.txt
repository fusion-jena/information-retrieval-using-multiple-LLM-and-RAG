I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the architecture and training of the model, including the use of dilated convolutions, nested encoder-decoder structures, and binary cross-entropy loss function. It also provides some experimental results and comparisons with other models. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps.
