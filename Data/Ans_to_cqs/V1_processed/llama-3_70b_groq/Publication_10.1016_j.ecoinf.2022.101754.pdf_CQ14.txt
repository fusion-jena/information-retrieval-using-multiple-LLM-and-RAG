The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "Tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done for each set." However, it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
