The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the proposed method exhibits improved accuracy by 1.35% and 0.08% in comparison to IA-YOLO on both datasets, respectively. This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, the context provides some numerical values (56.03, 82.47, 57.99, 86.82) but does not explain what these values represent, so it is unclear if they are related to the evaluation metrics.
