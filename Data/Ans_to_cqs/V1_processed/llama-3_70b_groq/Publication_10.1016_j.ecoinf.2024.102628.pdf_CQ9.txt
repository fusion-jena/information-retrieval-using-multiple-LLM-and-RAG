I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various topics such as autoencoders, random forest, partial least squares regression, and the use of ResNet-34 architecture for deep learning tasks, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
