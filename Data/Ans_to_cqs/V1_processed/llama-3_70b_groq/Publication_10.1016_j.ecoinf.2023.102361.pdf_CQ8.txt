The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the dataset used in the research was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through a GitHub repository: https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets. This suggests that the dataset is available on GitHub, but it does not provide information about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
