I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to spatial blocking, model training, and background point selection for species distribution modeling, but it does not discuss deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
