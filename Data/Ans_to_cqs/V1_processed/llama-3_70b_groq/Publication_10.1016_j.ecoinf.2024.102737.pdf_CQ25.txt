The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. The model is designed to recognize bluespotted ribbontail rays (Taeniura Lymma) from images, which is a classification task. The authors are exploring different approaches to improve the performance of the model, including pose handling, feature extraction enhancement, and data augmentation. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing the species from images, which is a typical classification problem in computer vision.
