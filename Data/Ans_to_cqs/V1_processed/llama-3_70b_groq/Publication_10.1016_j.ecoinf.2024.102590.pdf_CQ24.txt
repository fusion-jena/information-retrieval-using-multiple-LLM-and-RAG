The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context discusses supervised learning, specifically the use of the Random Forest classifier, which is a traditional machine learning algorithm. It does not provide information on deep learning or how to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of random points and random sampling approaches in the data collection and classification process. For example, 400 random points were generated within the subplot, and random points were assigned to one of the two land cover classes. Additionally, the Random Forest classifier uses a randomly selected subset of training data and independent variables to produce multiple decision trees. But again, this is not related to deep learning or handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.
