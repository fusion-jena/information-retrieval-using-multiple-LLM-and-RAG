I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The text appears to discuss redescription mining, a technique for finding alternative descriptions of the same phenomenon, and its application to dental and climate variables. It describes the parameters and constraints used in the redescription mining process, but does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
