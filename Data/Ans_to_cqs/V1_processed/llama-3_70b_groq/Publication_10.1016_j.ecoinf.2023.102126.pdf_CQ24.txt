I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines, random seed values, or strategies to handle randomness. The context appears to be focused on FAIR principles, genomic data archives, and the evaluation of datasets using the F-UJI tool. It discusses the importance of following FAIR principles in research and development, particularly in the biopharmaceutical industry and life sciences. The context also explains how the F-UJI tool is used to assess the compliance of datasets with FAIR principles, but it does not mention deep learning or randomness. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
