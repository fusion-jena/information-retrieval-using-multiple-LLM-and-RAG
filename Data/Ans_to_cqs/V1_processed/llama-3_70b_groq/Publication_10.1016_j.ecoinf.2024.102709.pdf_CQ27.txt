Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the training process, including the use of k-fold cross-validation, the selection of the best training-test split, and the evaluation of the models using metrics such as mAP50, precision, recall, and training time. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
