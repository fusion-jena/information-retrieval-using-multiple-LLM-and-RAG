I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the training settings and hyperparameters used for each SDM (Species Distribution Model) are described in Table 3, but the table is not provided. Additionally, the context cites several papers related to machine learning and species distribution modeling, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
