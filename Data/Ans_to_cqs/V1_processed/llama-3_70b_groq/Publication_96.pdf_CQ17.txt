Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of Deep Learning techniques for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Landsat 8 imagery and Google Cloud computing. It explains the methodology, study region, and data processing steps, but it does not provide information about regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
