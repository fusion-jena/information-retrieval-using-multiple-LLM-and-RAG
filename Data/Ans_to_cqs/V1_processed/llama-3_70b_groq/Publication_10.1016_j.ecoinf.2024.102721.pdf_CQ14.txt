The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization (BO). This is stated in the text as "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a global optimization algorithm that optimizes the hyper parameters in ML models to achieve high simulation accuracy." This approach is used instead of manual tuning, grid search, or random search due to the non-linear interaction between hyperparameters, which makes manual tuning ineffective. The BO algorithm is based on the Bayesian theorem and uses a probabilistic proxy model, specifically a Gaussian process, to estimate the prediction error of the LSTM model with various hyperparameters. Through iterative computation of BO and constant correction of the prior probabilities, the agent model closely approximates the location of the objective functions, allowing for the optimization of hyperparameters.
