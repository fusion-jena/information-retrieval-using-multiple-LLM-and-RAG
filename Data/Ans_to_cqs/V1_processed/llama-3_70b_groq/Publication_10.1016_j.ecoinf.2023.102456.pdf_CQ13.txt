I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the use of the Gumbel-Softmax function, the update criterion, and the neural network architecture, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
