The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model or the evaluation metrics used to assess its performance. The context discusses the use of machine learning and statistical methods for predicting biogeographical patterns of fungal productivity in forest ecosystems, but it does not specify the type of model used.

However, it is mentioned that the model hyperparameters were tuned using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation. This suggests that RMSE is used as a performance metric, but it does not provide information on other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that RMSE is used as a performance metric, but I do not have enough information to determine if other metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall are used.
