Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on streamflow forecasting, data-driven modeling approaches, and the importance of input variable selection. It does not provide information on specific techniques used to handle data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the importance of robust and efficient methods for selecting suitable inputs, especially when dealing with a large number of input variables. This could imply that addressing data bias is an important consideration in the preprocessing stage, but the specific techniques used to do so are not discussed.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
