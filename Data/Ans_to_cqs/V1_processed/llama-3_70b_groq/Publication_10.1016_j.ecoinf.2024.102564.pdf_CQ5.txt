The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, but it does not provide information about the datasets used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
