I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be discussing the use of machine learning methods, specifically artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It describes the architecture and training of the ANNs and SVMs, but does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
