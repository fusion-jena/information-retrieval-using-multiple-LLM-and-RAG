The type of deep learning model used in the BirdNET pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that BirdNET facilitates the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations through a developed deep neural network. Since BirdNET is used for audio classification, it is likely that a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) is used, as these architectures are commonly used for audio processing tasks. However, without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the BirdNET pipeline.
