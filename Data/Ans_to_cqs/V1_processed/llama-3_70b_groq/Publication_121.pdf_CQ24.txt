I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context focuses on using MobileNetV3 transfer learning for plant species identification, comparing it to other models, and developing a mobile app for tree species identification in rural forests. It discusses the training process, fine-tuning, and app development, but does not touch on the topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
