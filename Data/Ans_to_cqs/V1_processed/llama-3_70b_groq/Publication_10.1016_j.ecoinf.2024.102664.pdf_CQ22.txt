Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models are R2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). These metrics are used to assess the forecast performance of the models in predicting Chl concentrations.

R2 values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better model performance. In the context, R2 values are used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the models to the training data and to compare the performance of different models.

RMSE, on the other hand, measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance.

There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context, which are commonly used metrics in classification problems. The context suggests that the deep learning models are used for regression tasks, where R2 and RMSE are more suitable evaluation metrics.
