The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the configuration of the model, including the Adam solver, number of neurons, learning rate, and activation function. It also mentions the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model and the training process of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that ML algorithms were used to compensate for missing values in the dataset, but it does not provide further details on the preprocessing steps. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
