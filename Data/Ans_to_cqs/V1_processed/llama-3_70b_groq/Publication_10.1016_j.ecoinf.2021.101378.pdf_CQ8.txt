I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context appears to be related to a research article on predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease using machine learning algorithms, and it discusses various machine learning methods and models used in the study. However, it does not provide any information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
