I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing the use of MaxEnt models for predicting species distribution patterns and trends in the context of climate change, specifically in wetland ecosystems. It mentions disabling clamping in MaxEnt to allow the model to extend the estimated probability distribution beyond the parameter ranges observed in the training set, but it does not discuss regularization methods used in deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
