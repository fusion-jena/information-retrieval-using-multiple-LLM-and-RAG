The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "A link to a depository with architecture details is given at the end of references." This suggests that the repository link might be available in the references section, but it is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the exact repository where the code is available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
