The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on camera trap data and species identification, with references to papers and studies on using deep learning techniques for image filtering, labelling, and species identification. There is no mention of traditional deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
