Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the architecture of the DeepMeerkat model, including the use of convolutional neural networks, dropout for regularization, and softmax layers for output probabilities. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm used for training the model, such as SGD, Adam, or others.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
