Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in the text as "a dropout" was used to reduce overfitting and imitate the training of a set of different models. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods being used.
