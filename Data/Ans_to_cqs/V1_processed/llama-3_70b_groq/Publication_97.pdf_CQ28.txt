The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the neural network implementation was done in a Python-based computational environment using the Keras framework with TensorFlow as a backend, and all computations were performed on a PC with a specific GPU and RAM configuration. There is no information about cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
