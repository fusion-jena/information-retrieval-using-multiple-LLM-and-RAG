The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context primarily focuses on addressing sampling bias in PO data analysis, particularly in ecological informatics.

However, it does mention methods for mitigating sampling bias through dataset filtering, such as the target-group background method and spatial thinning. Additionally, it discusses the importance of removing heterogeneous observations, which can be achieved through manual checking by experts.

While these methods are related to addressing data bias, they are not specifically tailored to deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query based on the provided context.
