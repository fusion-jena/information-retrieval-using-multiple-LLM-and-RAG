The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated using various metrics such as adjusted R-squared (adj_R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) on both the training and testing datasets. The performance of the model was also compared across different hyper-parameters, such as the number of trees, to select the optimal model. Additionally, the importance of each predictor variable was evaluated using the "Feature Importance" metric.
