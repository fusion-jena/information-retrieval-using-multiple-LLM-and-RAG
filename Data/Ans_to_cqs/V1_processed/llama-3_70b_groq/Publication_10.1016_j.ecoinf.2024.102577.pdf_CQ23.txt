The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the performance of different machine learning models, including Random Forest, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, Naïve Bayes, and others. 

However, it does mention that a 5 × 10-fold cross-validation was performed for each model to ensure the generalizability of the results. This is stated in the section "3.2. Performance of the models and forecast distribution" and in Table 4, which shows the mean accuracies and standard deviations of the 5 × 10-fold cross-validations for each method and species.

There is no mention of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting being used to ensure generalizability.
