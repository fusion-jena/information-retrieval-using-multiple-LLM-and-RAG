I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only discusses the architecture of the CNN model, its performance, and the hardware specifications of various devices used for testing. It does not provide information about the training process or the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
