I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be discussing data reporting and processing in the context of earth system science, specifically in relation to the FRAMES framework. It discusses the importance of standardized formats, quality control, and metadata reporting, but does not mention specific techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
