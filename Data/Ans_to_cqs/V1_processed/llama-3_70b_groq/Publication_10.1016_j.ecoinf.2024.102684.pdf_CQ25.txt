The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is for regression and segmentation tasks. Specifically, it is used for predicting species presence or coverage in remote sensing applications. The model can be used for regression tasks, such as estimating continuous transitions and patterns in the landscape, like plant covers. Additionally, it can be used for semantic segmentation tasks, such as using the UNet model. The output of the model is a prediction between 0.0 and 1.0, indicating the invasion probability.
