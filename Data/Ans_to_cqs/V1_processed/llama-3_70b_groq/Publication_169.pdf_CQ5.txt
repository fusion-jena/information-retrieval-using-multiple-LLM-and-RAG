The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the "One-hundred plant species leaves data set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset is used for image recognition and classification of plant species. It consists of images of plant leaves in grey scale, with 24 species shown in Figure 5. The dataset is not large enough for deep learning, so data augmentation is used to enlarge the dataset and overcome the problem of overfitting.
