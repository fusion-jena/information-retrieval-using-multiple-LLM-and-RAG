The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. However, it does mention the importance of training samples and their representativeness in influencing the accuracy of classification models.

It is mentioned that the study employed feature optimization tools to address the issue of insufficient or excessive training samples, but it does not provide details on the specific preprocessing steps used. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study.

In general, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are common practices in deep learning to prepare the data for model training. Normalization involves scaling the data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming the data to a specific range, such as -1 to 1, to improve model performance. Cleaning involves removing missing or noisy data, handling outliers, and transforming data types to ensure consistency.

However, without more information, I cannot determine if these specific preprocessing steps were used in this study.
