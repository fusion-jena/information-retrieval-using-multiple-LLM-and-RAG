The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. The context primarily focuses on face recognition and pose handling, discussing methods like feature-extraction enhancement, data augmentation, one-to-many augmentation, and many-to-one normalization.

However, it is mentioned that using data augmentation gave inferior results to using the feature extraction enhancement method, and that preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation is a preferred way with significantly better results. This suggests that the authors are exploring alternative methods to address challenges in the pipeline, but the specific techniques mentioned in the query are not discussed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the answer to the query, as it is not addressed in the given text.
