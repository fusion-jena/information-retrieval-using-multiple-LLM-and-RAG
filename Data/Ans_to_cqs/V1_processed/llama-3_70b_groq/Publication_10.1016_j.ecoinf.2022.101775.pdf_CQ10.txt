I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing various concepts and techniques in deep learning, including embedding layers, stochastic gradient descent, and matrix factorization. The references cited are mostly academic papers and do not include a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
