Based on the provided context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for extracting image features, which suggests that image data is the primary input format. Additionally, the context references various image datasets, such as ImageNet, and papers related to image recognition and object detection, further supporting the notion that image data is the primary format used.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context, suggesting that they are not used in this specific deep learning pipeline. Similarly, there is no mention of CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, which are typically used for tabular data, indicating that they are not used in this pipeline.

It's worth noting that the context focuses on the application of deep learning techniques to herbarium specimens, which are typically represented as images. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that image data is the primary format used in this pipeline.
