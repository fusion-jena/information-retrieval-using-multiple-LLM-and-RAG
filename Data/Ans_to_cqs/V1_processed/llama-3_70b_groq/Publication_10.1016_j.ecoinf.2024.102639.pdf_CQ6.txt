The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention dimensionality reduction using a technique that retains the majority of the original data's variance, and the selection of a distance metric (typically Euclidean) based on the data's characteristics and analytical prerequisites. 

It does not provide information on normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are common preprocessing steps in deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this context.
