Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text only mentions that a min-max scaler is used to compute the performance metrics in the test set, but it does not specify what those metrics are. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
