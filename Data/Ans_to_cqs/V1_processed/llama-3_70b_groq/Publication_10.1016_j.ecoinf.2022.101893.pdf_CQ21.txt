The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the dataset division, model building, and performance evaluation using accuracy as an indicator. It does not provide information on postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, which is a common metric in classification problems. But, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps or metrics calculation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
