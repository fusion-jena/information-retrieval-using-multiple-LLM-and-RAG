Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The context mentions resizing input images to specific dimensions (224 × 224 × 3 and 299 × 299 × 3) and applying in-place image augmentation, indicating that images are the primary data format used. There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline.

However, it's worth noting that some of the cited references do mention audio data formats, such as in the context of bird sound recognition. For example, the reference to Kahl et al. (2020) mentions bird sound recognition in complex acoustic environments, and Kahl et al. (2021) discusses a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring. These references suggest that audio data formats may be used in related but separate pipelines or applications.

There is no mention of CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
