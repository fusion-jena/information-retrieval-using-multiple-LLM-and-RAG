Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the classification pipeline, model evaluation, and the architecture of the CNN model used. It discusses the VGG16 architecture and its performance on the ImageNet dataset, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
