The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it mentions the use of a random forest model, as indicated by the hyperparameters "mtry", "min.node.size", and "num.trees" which are specific to the R package "ranger". These hyperparameters are used to tune the random forest model, but they are not related to deep learning models.

The hyperparameters mentioned are:

* "mtry": the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split
* "min.node.size": the minimum size of terminal nodes
* "num.trees": the number of trees to grow

There is no mention of hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer, which are typically used in deep learning models.
