Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on research in natural areas such as agro-land ecology, ecosystem service value, and environmental challenges, with mentions of various machine learning models and data analysis techniques. However, it does not provide specific information on addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines.

While the context mentions deep learning algorithms and models, such as random forest, support vector machines, and Bayesian networks, it does not delve into the preprocessing steps or techniques used to handle data bias. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.

If you're looking for general information on techniques to address data bias, some common methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, data augmentation, and using bias-reducing algorithms. However, these are not mentioned in the provided context.
