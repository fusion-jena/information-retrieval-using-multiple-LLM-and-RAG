The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. This is inferred from the text, which mentions "classification accuracy rate" and "correct rate" in the context of evaluating the model's performance. Additionally, the text mentions that the research focuses on "object detection and classification based on feature extraction", which further supports the conclusion that the model is intended for classification tasks.
