Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data processing, image processing software, and land use/land cover classification accuracy using XGBoost.

The context does mention the six significant steps involved in UAV data processing, which include camera parameter correction, setting up connection points, point fine-tuning, editing ground control points, and others. However, it does not provide information on postprocessing steps after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
