The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) for image classification, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
