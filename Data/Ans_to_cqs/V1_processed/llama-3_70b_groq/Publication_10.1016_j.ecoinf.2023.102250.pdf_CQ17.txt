The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention spectral normalization, which is a regularization technique used to stabilize the training of deep neural networks. It is not explicitly stated as a method to prevent overfitting, but it can be used for that purpose.

Other than spectral normalization, the context does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. It focuses more on the architecture of the neural network, attention mechanisms, and dynamic convolutional kernels.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a comprehensive list of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
