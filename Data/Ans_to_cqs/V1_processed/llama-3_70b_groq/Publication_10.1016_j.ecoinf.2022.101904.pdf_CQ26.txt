The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to adaptively synthesize wetland training data, which can help address the problem of imbalanced data. Specifically, the 3D GAN model uses a conditional map unit to produce synthetic samples from a random noise vector, similar to the Generative Adversarial Minority Over-sampling (GAMO) and 3D-HyperGAMO methods. This approach can help eliminate the problem of imbalanced data, which is typical in wetland mapping.

It does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used in this specific deep learning pipeline.
