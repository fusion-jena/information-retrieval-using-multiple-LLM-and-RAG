I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research article discussing the development of a non-invasive method for species and sex identification of rare forest carnivores using footprint identification technology. The article provides information on the challenges of collecting data on rare species, the importance of non-invasive survey methods, and the potential applications of footprint identification technology. However, it does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository.
