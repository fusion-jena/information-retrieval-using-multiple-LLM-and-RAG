The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It describes a combination of least squares methods via genetic algorithms to estimate the model parameters and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to obtain their distribution. The genetic algorithm is used to partially optimize the results of the estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
