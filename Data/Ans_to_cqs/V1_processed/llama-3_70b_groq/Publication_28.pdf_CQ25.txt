The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the PTDLEN-VAE model, is for satellite image classification. The model is designed to examine satellite images for ecological condition monitoring and assign proper class labels to the images. The model consists of a series of operations, including pre-processing, feature extraction using the EfficientNet model, parameter optimization using the IKHO algorithm, and classification using the VAE model. The ultimate goal is to classify the satellite images into their respective categories for ecological condition monitoring.
