Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection methods are related to nighttime light remote sensing and ecological informatics. However, the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.

From the references provided, it can be inferred that nighttime light imagery is used as a data source, which is likely collected through remote sensing satellites. Additionally, the context mentions bioclimate variables, which might be collected through a combination of sensors, public datasets, and potentially surveys.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this question based on the provided context.

In summary, while the context provides some hints about the data sources used, it does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.
