Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyperparameter Î» is set to a specific value (8.75e-5) to control the average error on the validation set, but it does not provide information on the optimization method used to obtain this value. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
