I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper discussing the performance of various object detection algorithms on an underwater optical image dataset, and proposing a new algorithm called UODN. The paper provides details on the experimental results, methodology, and some technical aspects of the algorithms, but it does not provide information on where the code repository can be found.
