I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, being used in the pipeline. The context discusses multiple-instance learning, machine learning approaches, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
