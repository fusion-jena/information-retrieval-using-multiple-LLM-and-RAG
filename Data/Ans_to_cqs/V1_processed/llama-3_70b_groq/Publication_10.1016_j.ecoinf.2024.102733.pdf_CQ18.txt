The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a scheduler is used to adjust the learning rate when the network reaches a plateau. This suggests that the model's performance is being monitored during training, and the learning rate is adjusted accordingly to prevent the model from getting stuck in a plateau. However, the specific metrics or evaluation methods used to monitor the model's performance are not mentioned.
