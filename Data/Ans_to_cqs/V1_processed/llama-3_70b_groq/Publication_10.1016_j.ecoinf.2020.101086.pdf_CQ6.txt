The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution models and correction methods in ecology, and it discusses parameterization of these models, transformation of model input data, and calculation of sampling effort. There is no mention of deep learning models or preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
