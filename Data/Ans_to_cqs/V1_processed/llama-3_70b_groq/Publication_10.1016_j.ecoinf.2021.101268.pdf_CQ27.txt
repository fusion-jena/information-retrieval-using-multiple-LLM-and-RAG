Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different deep learning models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) on a plant species classification task, including their accuracy on raw and pre-processed images, and the effect of swapping testing sets between pre-processed and raw images. It also discusses the importance of interpretability in deep learning models and introduces a new dataset for Peruvian Amazon Forestry.

However, it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
