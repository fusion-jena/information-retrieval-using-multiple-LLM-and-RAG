I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The text only mentions that a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm was used to construct a pest hazard class classification model, but it does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
