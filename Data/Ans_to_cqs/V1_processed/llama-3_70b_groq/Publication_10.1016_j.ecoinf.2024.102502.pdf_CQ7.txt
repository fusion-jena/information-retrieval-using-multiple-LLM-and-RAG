I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily focuses on data filtering, data scaling, and preprocessing steps in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for environmental data analysis. It discusses the use of filters, masking functions, and scaling protocols, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
