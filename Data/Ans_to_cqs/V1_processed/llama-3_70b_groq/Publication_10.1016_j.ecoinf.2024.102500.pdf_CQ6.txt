Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models such as LGBM, GB, XGB, RF, and ET, and does not discuss preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
