Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Binarization of the results (sky vs other)
2. Extraction of the classes below the sky
3. Extraction of the skyline
4. Filter images that have natural objects below the sky
5. Selection of reference points from the photo and association to the classified object
6. Extraction of distances
7. Creation of metrics per class object, including:
   - Normalized Segment Length
   - Sample variance
   - Average absolute deviation

These steps are mentioned in the context as part of the data selection and processing pipeline. However, there is no mention of Saliency maps or Confusion matrix as postprocessing steps in the provided context.
