Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in the context as "Without Dropout" and "With Dropout" in Table 3, which suggests that dropout is a regularization technique used in the deep learning model. Additionally, the context states that Model 9, which incorporates dropout, is the most optimal deep-learning model, implying that dropout is an effective regularization method in this case. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.
