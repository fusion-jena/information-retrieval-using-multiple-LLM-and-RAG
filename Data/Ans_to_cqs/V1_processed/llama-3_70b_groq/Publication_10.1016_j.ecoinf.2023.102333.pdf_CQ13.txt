The context does not explicitly list all the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions some common hyperparameters, such as the number of layers and nodes, learning rate, and dropout rate. Additionally, it mentions that the hyperparameters of the DNN model were automatically optimized according to a search grid of several hyperparameters listed in Table 1, but the table is not provided.

Therefore, we can conclude that the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the learning rate and dropout rate, but the optimizer is not specified. The context does not provide a comprehensive list of hyperparameters used in the model.
