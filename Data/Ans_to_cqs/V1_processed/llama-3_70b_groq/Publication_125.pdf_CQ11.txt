I don't know. The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the architecture of a CNN model, the concept of ResNet and Xception models, and the motivation behind a research project that applies privacy-preserving deep learning to satellite images. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
