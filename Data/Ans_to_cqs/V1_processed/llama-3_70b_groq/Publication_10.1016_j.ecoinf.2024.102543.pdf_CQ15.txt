Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the YOLOv8 algorithm, its network structures, and modifications to the architecture, as well as data preprocessing and augmentation techniques. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
