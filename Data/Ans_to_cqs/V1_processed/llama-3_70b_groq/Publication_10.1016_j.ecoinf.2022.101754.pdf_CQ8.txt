I don't know.

The provided context consists of academic papers, theses, and references related to remote sensing, machine learning, and biomass estimation. However, there is no mention of a specific code repository or a deep learning pipeline associated with the papers or theses. The context does not provide any information about the availability of code or its repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
