Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the training of models using multitask learning and transfer learning, and the evaluation of their performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps that may be applied after model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating additional metrics, or creating confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
