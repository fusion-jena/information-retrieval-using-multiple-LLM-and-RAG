The pipeline uses a combination of deep learning models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Swin Transformer, which is a type of Transformer model. Additionally, the pipeline also uses a 3DUNetGSFormer model, which is not explicitly defined in the provided context, but based on the name, it appears to be a type of 3D U-Net model. The context also mentions the use of a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model in some experiments.
