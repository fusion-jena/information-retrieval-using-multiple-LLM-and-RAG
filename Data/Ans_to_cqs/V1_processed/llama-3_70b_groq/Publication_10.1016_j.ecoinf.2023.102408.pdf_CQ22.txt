The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models (not specifically deep learning models) are R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE (root mean squared error). These metrics are used to compare the accuracies of the models. The MAE is calculated using the formula provided in Eq. 12. There is no mention of accuracy, precision, or recall in the provided context.
