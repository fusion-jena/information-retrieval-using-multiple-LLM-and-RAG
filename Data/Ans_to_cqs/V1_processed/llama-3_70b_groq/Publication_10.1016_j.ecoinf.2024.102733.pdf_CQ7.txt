According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is a stratified train-test split. This means that the proportion of each class in the original dataset is maintained in both the training and validation sets. In this specific case, the proportion is 80% for training and 20% for validation. This approach is particularly beneficial for imbalanced datasets, ensuring that all classes participate in both the training and validation phases of the model.
