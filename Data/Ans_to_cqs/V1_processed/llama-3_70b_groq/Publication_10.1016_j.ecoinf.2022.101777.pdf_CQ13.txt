I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text appears to be discussing a different topic, such as soil conservation, infiltration capacity, and land use changes. There is no mention of learning rates, optimizers, or any other hyperparameters typically associated with deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
