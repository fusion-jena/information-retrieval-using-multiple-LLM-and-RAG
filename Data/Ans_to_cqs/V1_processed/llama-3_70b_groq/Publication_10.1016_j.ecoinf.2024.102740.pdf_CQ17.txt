The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to random forest (RF) technique, machine learning, and remote sensing for grassland classification and analysis. It discusses the use of RF for classification, hyperparameter tuning, and the importance of grasslands in terrestrial ecosystems. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
