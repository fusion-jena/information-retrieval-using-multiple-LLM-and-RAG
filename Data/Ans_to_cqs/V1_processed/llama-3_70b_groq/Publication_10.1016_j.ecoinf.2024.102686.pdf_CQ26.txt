I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the data sources, preprocessing steps, and challenges related to the human activity-natural endowment coupled zoning index system. It does not provide information on techniques used to handle data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
