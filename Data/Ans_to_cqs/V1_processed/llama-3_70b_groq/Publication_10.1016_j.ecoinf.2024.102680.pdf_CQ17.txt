Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on convolutional neural networks, particularly dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution, which are used to reduce computational complexity. It also mentions a reweighting strategy used in Boosting R-CNN to adjust the classification loss, but this is not a regularization method for preventing overfitting. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
