I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context discusses various studies and research on wildfire event predictions in Australia, including the use of deep learning technology, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
