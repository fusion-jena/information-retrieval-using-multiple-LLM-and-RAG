I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning algorithms for tree species classification using remote sensing data. It cites various references and includes figures, but it does not provide information about a code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
