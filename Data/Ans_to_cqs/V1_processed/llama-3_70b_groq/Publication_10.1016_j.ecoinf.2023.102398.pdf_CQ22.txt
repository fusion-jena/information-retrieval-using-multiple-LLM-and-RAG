The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision (P), recall (R), mean average precision (mAP), and the F1-score. These metrics are calculated using the following equations: 

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
P = TP / (TP + FP)
R = TP / (TP + FN)
F1 Score = 2 × (P × R) / (P + R)
AP = ∑[k=n to 0] [R(k) - R(k + 1)] × P(k)
mAP = (∑[k=N to 1] APk) / N

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, with precision giving the ratio of true predictions to the total number of predictions, recall giving the ratio of true predictions to the total number of objects present in the image, and F1-score providing the model's test accuracy. The mean average precision (mAP) is also used as a measure of accuracy for the machine learning algorithm.
