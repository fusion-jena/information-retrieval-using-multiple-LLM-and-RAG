Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. It discusses the importance of labeling data, the use of U-Net models, and the conversion of sub-class land-cover maps to macro-class land-cover maps. However, it does not provide information on specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
