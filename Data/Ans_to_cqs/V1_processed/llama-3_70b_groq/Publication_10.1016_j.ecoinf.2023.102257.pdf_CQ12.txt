The context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting whether an image is empty or not, and also for object detection models that localize target objects (animals) within an image. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. Therefore, I can only infer that CNNs are used in some part of the pipeline, but I don't know the exact type of model used in the entire pipeline.
