Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context discusses the tuning of parameters for a support vector machine (SVM) model, uncertainty quantification, and references to various studies on machine learning and deep learning applications. However, it does not provide information on the specific evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
