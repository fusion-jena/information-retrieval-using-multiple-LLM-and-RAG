The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred from the accuracy and loss curves presented in Figure 11 that the training process is continued until the loss value reaches a minimum or stabilizes.

In the case of the FCN, UNet, and SegNet, the loss value reaches a minimum after 100,000 iterations and remains stable. For the DDCN, the loss value increases after 100,000 iterations but then decreases and stabilizes after the learning rate is reduced in the last 50,000 iterations. The DeepLabV3+ becomes stable after 100,000 iterations with the minimum loss observed.

Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the training process is continued until the loss value reaches a minimum or stabilizes, which is a common criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, the exact criteria used in this specific case are not provided.
