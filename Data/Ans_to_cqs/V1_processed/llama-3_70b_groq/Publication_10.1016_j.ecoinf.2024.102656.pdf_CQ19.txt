I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to ecology and conservation, discussing topics such as habitat suitability, species conservation, and environmental variables. It mentions statistical computing using R, but does not provide any information about deep learning models or frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
