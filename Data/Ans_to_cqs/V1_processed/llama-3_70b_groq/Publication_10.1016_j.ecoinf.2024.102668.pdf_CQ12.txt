I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text only mentions that the applicability of acoustic indices can be extended to fields like machine learning and deep learning, but it does not provide information about the type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
