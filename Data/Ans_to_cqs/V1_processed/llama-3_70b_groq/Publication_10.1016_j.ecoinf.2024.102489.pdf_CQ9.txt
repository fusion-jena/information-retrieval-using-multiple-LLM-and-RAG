I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with it. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and ecological informatics, discussing the use of satellite images and LAI (Leaf Area Index) products. It provides information about the sources of satellite images, such as USGS, CRESDA, and Copernicus, but does not mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
