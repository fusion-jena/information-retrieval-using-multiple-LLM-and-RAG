I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be related to a study on agriculture, land-use changes, and climate change, but it does not provide information on a deep learning model or its evaluation. The text mentions kriging variance and RMSE of residuals, which suggests that the study may have used geostatistical methods, but it does not provide information on deep learning models or their generalizability.
