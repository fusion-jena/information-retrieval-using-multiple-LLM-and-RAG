The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically Land Use (LU) classification and Land Cover (LC) classification. This is evident from the context, which mentions "LU detection task" and "LU classification" multiple times, indicating that the model is designed to classify different land uses and land covers from satellite images.
