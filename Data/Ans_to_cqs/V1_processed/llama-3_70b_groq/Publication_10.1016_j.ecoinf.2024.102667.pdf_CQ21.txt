I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a research article in the field of ecological informatics, focusing on topics such as growing season NDVI, vegetation change, human activities, and climate change. The context includes mathematical equations, references to research papers, and figures related to ecological engineering programs in China.

However, there is no mention of model training, saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices, which are typically associated with machine learning or deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it seems out of context.
