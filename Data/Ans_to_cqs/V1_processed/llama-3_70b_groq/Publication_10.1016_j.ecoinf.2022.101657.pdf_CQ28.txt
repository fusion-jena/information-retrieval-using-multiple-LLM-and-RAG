I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform of the deep learning model. It discusses various topics such as camera trap sampling, neural networks, and FPGA implementation, but it does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the model. The context mentions Raspberry Pi, which is a single-board computer, but it is not a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Therefore, I cannot determine the deployment platform from the given context.
