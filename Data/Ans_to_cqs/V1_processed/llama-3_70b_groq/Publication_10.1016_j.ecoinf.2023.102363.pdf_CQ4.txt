The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are pitch shift, time-shift, and added Gaussian white noise. These techniques are applied to the audio data prior to forming the spectrogram, and the parameters for each transformation are randomly selected from a pre-defined range. Specifically, the pitch-shift range is 0.5-1.5, the time-shift range is Â±300 ms, and the power of the added Gaussian white noise is between 1 and 2.
