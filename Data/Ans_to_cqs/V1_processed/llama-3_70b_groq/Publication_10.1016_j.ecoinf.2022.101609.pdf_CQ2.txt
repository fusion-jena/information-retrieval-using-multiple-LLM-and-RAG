The context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data is in a tabular or time-series format. This is because the analytics layer handles exploratory and inferential analysis of historic highway pollution data, and the model is trained to make hourly predictions of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration levels. Additionally, the context mentions data pre-processing steps such as data consistency verification, target attribute transformation, feature extraction, data encoding, and data imputation, which are typical steps for working with tabular or time-series data. 

It is likely that the data is in a format such as CSV, but this is not explicitly stated in the context. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the pipeline.
