The provided context mentions some of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Specifically, it mentions:

* Batch size: 30 during training, and 1 during testing
* Learning rate: 0.001
* Dropout rate: 0.001
* Bias value: 0
* Activation function: Leaky ReLU
* Width multiplier (for MobileNet): 1.2
* Resolution multiplier (for MobileNet): 1
* Number of epochs: 60 for models with less than 100 layers, and 80 for models with 100 or more layers
* Optimizer: Not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the optimizer is not specified as a hyperparameter, and the default optimizer in TensorFlow (version 1.12.0) is used.

Note that the optimizer is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
