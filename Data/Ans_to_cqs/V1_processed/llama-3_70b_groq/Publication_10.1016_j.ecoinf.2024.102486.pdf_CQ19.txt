The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it does mention the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet, which are related to deep learning. Additionally, it mentions Keras, which is a high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Theano. Therefore, it is possible that Keras is used to build the deep learning model, but the underlying framework is not specified.
