I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the comparison of different machine learning methods, including Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, and Random Forests, and their performance in a specific case study. It also mentions the implementation of these methods in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
