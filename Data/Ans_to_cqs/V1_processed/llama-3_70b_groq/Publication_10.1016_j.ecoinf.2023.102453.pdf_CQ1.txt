Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for ecological studies and wildlife monitoring. This is mentioned in the text as "camera trap devices" and "camera trap images" being used for image classification tasks. It is likely that these camera traps are set up in various locations to capture images of wildlife, which are then used as raw data for training and testing deep learning models.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the provided context. Sensors are not explicitly mentioned either, but it can be inferred that camera traps may be equipped with sensors to capture images.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of all possible methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, it is possible that other methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets may be used in other contexts or applications.
