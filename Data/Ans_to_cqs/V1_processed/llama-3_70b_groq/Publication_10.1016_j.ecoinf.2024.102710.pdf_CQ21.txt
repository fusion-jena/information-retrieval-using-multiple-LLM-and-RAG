The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation or analysis is being performed on the models, as there are mentions of "performance metrics" and "embedding space" in the context.

The context does provide some information about the experimental setup, such as the use of active learning strategies and the calculation of computational time for different strategies. It also mentions the use of UMAP plots to visualize the embedding layers of different models. However, it does not provide specific information about postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and it is unclear what postprocessing steps are involved after model training in this specific context.
