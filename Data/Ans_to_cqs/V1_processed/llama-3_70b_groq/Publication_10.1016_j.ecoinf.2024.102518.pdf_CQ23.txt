The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the evaluation of nine algorithms (Bioclim, Mahalanobis, Domain, GLM, MaxEnt, Random Forest, and SVM) for species distribution modeling. 

However, it does mention the use of cross-validation, which is a technique to ensure the generalizability of a model. The context states that the final optimal parameters were identified using cross-validation. Additionally, the average output of five models was used to derive the threshold, which suggests that some form of ensemble method or model averaging was employed. 

There is no mention of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
