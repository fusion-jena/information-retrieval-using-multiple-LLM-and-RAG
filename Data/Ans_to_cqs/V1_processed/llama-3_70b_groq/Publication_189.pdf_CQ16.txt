Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context provides information about the Mask R-CNN model, its architecture, and the training process, including the number of epochs and steps used for training and validation. However, it does not specify how the model determines when to stop training.

Typically, in deep learning, training is considered complete when a certain stopping criterion is met, such as when the validation loss plateaus or when a maximum number of epochs is reached. However, this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular case.
