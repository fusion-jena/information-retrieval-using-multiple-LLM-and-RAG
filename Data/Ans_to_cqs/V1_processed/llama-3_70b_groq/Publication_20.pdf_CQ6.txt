Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the model was trained using thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species, and environment, and that raw outputs were post-processed applying two decision rules. However, it does not provide information on any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that may have been applied to the data before training the model.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
