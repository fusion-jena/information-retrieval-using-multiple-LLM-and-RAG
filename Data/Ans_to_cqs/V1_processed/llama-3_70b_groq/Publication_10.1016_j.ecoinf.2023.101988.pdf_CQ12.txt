I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The paper by Chalmers et al. (2021) mentions the use of deep learning for acoustic monitoring and biodiversity modeling, but it does not specify the type of model used. The other references provided do not mention deep learning models or pipelines. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
