I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the study area, data acquisition and processing, network structure, and performance of the Res_AUNet network, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) where the data is stored.
