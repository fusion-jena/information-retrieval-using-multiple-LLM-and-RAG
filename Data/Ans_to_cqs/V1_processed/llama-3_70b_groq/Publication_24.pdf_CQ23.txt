Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the methodology and tools used for urban ecoacoustic assessment, including the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the ML pipeline written in Python. It does mention the application of different normalization strategies to improve network accuracy, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
