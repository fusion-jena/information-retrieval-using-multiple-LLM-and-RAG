I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a snippet from a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, discussing vegetation growth and its attribution to various factors such as climate, human activity, and terrain. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline, so it is not possible to determine where the code repository is available.
