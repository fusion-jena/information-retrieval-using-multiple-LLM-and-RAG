Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of a deep learning model, including the AdaptiveAvgPool operation, attention mechanism, and feature pyramid network. It also references various papers related to pest detection and management, but none of these papers discuss handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
