The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation was used to search for the optimal parameters of the RF model. This suggests that the training process was evaluated based on the OOB error and cross-validation scores, but the specific stopping criterion is not mentioned. Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
