I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any data formats related to it. The context appears to be related to a study on water quality and eutrophication in Plateau Lakes, discussing topics such as trophic state, water sampling, and spectral analysis of dissolved organic matter. There is no mention of deep learning or data formats like image, audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
