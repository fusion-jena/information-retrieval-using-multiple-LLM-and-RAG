The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on Short-billed Gulls using machine learning ensemble predictions, Geographic Information System (GIS), and socio-economic data. It discusses various machine learning algorithms such as RandomForest, CART, MARS, and their applications, but it does not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The context does not provide any information on deep learning pipelines or techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
