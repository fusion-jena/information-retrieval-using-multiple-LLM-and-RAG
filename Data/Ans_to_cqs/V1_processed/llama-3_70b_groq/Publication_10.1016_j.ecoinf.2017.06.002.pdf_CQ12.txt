I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific pipeline that uses them. The context appears to be related to data management, metadata, and data synthesis in the field of environmental science, but it does not provide any information about deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
