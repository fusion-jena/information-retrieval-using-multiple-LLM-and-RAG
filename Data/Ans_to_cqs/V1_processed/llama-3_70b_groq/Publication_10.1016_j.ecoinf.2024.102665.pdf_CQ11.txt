I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning and clustering techniques to analyze coral reef community data. It cites various references and includes figures, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
