The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on voice feature extraction, deep learning algorithms, and the implementation of the Mel spectrogram feature extraction. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pattern recognition in sound recordings and the optimization of CNN model parameters. 

There is no mention of data annotation techniques, which are typically used in computer vision tasks, such as object detection, image segmentation, or classification. The context is centered around audio data and voice feature extraction, making it unlikely that data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation would be relevant. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
