I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on membership inference attacks, deep learning model generalization, and image recognition, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
