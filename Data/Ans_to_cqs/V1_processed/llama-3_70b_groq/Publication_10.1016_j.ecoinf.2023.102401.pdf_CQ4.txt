The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the context, are:

1. HSV adjustment: modifying the image's hue, saturation, and value components.
2. Rotation: randomly rotating the image within a specific range.
3. Scaling: changing the size of the image while maintaining its aspect ratio.
4. Cropping: randomly cropping a portion of the image.
5. Flipping: horizontally flipping the image.
6. Mosaicking: combining multiple randomly cropped, resized, and rotated images to create a single image, enhancing the background of the identified object.

These data augmentation techniques introduce diversity into the training dataset, enabling the model to learn robust features and improve its performance in real-world scenarios.
