Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses various models and techniques, such as AdaLAM, SORT, Deep SORT, and Kalman Filter, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.

The context mentions random search in the first sentence, but it is not clear if this refers to hyperparameter optimization or something else. There is no mention of grid search or any other hyperparameter optimization method.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
