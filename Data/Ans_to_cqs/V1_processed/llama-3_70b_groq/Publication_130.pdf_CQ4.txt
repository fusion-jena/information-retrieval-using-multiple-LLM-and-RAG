Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text only mentions that a data augmentation procedure was used to increase the training sample size by applying transformations to an existing set of images. It does not provide details on the specific techniques used, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
