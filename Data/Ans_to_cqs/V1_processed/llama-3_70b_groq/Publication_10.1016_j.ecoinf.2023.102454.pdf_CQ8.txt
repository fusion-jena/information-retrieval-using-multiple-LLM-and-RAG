I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper discussing a study on energy consumption and carbon emissions in Xi'an, China, and provides information on data sources and methods used in the study. There is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
