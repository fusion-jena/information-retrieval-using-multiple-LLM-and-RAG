The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The table provided lists the optimized parameters, including the learning rate, momentum, and SD threshold, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used. 

However, based on the mention of the "momentum" parameter, it is possible that the optimization technique used is a variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum. But this is only an educated guess, and without further information, it is impossible to determine the exact optimization technique used.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
