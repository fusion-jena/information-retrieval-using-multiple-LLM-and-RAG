The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is folded cross-validation. This involves partitioning the dataset into ten equal sections, known as folds, and then conducting a cyclical process of training and testing. In each cycle, one fold serves as the test set, while the remaining nine folds are used for training. The trained model is then evaluated on the test set, and the resulting performance metrics are recorded. By averaging these outcomes, a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance is obtained. This approach allows for rigorous monitoring of the model's performance during training and helps to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.
