Based on the provided context, it appears that the preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is uniform resizing of images to 288 × 288. This is mentioned in the context as "All training and test images are uniformly resized to 288 × 288." There is no mention of other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, it can be inferred that uniform resizing is the only preprocessing step mentioned in the context.
