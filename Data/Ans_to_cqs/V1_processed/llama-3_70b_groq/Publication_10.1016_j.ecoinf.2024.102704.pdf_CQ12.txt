The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This can be inferred from the mention of "convolutional layer", "batch normalization", and "activation layer" in the context, which are typical components of a CNN architecture. Additionally, the mention of specific CNN models such as ResNet-50, Inception V3, and DenseNet further supports this conclusion.
