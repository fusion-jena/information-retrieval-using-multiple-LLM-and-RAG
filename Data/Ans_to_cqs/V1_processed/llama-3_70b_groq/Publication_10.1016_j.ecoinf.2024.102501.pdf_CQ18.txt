Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context provides information about the different models used, their performances on the training and validation sets, and the experimental setup. However, it does not discuss the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
