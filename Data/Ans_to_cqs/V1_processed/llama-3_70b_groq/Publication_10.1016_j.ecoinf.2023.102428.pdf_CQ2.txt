I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the MLPnn-MC model, which integrates a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation. It also mentions the use of ERDAS IMAGINE for stratified random sampling and creating sample points in the study area. However, there is no mention of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
