I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It only discusses the training and evaluation of various machine learning models, including linear regression, Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, for predicting forest canopy cover. The context provides information on the hyperparameter tuning process using grid search and cross-validation, but it does not provide any information on how the trained models were deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
