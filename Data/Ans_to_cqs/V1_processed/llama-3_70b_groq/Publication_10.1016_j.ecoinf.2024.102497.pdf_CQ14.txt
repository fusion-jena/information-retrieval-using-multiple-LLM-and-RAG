The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model are optimized. It only mentions that "fine-tuning the model parameters - such as 'n_estimators', 'max_depth', 'min_samples_split', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_features' - was crucial to achieving optimal prediction results and enhancing nearshore bathymetry accuracy." However, it does not specify the method used for fine-tuning these parameters, such as grid search, random search, or other methods.
