Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. The text mentions "aerial images" and "whale images" being used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, the context discusses image-related topics such as image quality, image super-resolution, and image pre-processing for CNNs. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is image data.
