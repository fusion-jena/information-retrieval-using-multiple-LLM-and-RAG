Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning-based image analysis in microfluidic soil chips to characterize soil bacterial communities, and it does not delve into the technical details of the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
