The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model in this context are Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Index (KI). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps generated by the model. The Overall Accuracy (OA) is calculated as the total number of pixels classified correctly divided by the total number of pixels, multiplied by 100. The Kappa Index (KI) is also used to evaluate the classification accuracy, but it takes into account the possibility of chance agreement between the predicted and actual classes. These metrics are commonly used in remote sensing and land cover classification tasks to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
