I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context mentions Xeno-canto, a public online database of bird sounds, and eBird, a citizen science platform for bird observations, but it does not provide information about a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
