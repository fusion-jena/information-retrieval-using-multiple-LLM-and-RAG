The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the process of model retraining, manual classification, and improving model performance, but it does not provide specific details on the training completion criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
