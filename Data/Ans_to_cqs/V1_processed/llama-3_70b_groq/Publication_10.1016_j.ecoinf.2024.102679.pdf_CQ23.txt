The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was fine-tuned for 4 iterations using the entire SW stratum employing the SAL (Species Annotation Loop), which suggests that the model was trained on a specific dataset or stratum. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was selected based on its performance on the validation set at each training stage, which implies that some form of validation or testing was performed to evaluate the model's performance. However, the exact details of the dataset, validation process, or splitting strategy used are not provided.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based on the provided context.
