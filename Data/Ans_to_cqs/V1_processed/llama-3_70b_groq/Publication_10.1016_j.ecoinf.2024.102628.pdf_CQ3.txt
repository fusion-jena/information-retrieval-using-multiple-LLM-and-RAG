I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the use of deep learning models, particularly ResNet-34, for forest classification using 2D LiDAR images, and the application of transfer learning and cross-validation techniques. It does not provide information on how the data was annotated or prepared for training the models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
