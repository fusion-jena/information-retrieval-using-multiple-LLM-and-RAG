The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the use of stochastic gradient descent with random sampling of training batches, which introduces randomness in the model training process. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a deep ensemble method, which involves training multiple models with different random weight initializations. This approach is used to perform approximate Bayesian inference and can be seen as a way to handle randomness in the model weights. The randomness in the weight initialization, along with the random sampling of training batches, causes each model to converge to a different local minimum in the solution space, resulting in an approximate posterior distribution.

In summary, the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the context, include random sampling of training batches and the use of a deep ensemble method with random weight initializations. However, the use of a random seed value is not explicitly mentioned.
