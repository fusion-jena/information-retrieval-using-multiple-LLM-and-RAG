I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions a North American Animal Tracks Database (org/projects/north-american-animal-tracks-database), but it does not provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context also cites several research papers and books, but none of them provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
