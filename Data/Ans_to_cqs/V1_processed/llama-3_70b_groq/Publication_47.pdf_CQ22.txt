The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (IUC-NN) are accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Specifically, the test accuracy of the best IUC-NN model on the binary threat level is 84.3%, with a positive predictive value of 88% and a negative predictive value of 79%. Additionally, the validation cross-entropy loss is also mentioned as a metric used to evaluate the model's performance during the training process. However, precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned as evaluation metrics in the provided context.
