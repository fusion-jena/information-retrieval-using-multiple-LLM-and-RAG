I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The "Data availability" section only mentions that "Data will be made available on request", but it does not provide a link to a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository.
