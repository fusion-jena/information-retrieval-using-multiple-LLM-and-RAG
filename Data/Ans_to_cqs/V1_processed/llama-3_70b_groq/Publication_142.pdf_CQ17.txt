Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various topics such as internal covariate shift, AI naturalists, and image classification, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention "network training by reducing internal covariate shift" which is related to a regularization method called Batch Normalization. Batch Normalization is a technique used to reduce internal covariate shift, which can help prevent overfitting.

But, the context does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.

If you need information on regularization methods, I can provide general information on common techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning, but it would not be based on the provided context.
