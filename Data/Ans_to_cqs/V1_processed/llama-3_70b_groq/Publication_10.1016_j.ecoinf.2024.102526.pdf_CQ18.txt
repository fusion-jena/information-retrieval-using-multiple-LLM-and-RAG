The provided context appears to be related to a study or survey involving image capture and analysis, possibly in a marine or biological context. It includes details about the planned study design, image capture settings, and data curation. However, there is no mention of a model or its performance, nor is there any indication of a training process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
