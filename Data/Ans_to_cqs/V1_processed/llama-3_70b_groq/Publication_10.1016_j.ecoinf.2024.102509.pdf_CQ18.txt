The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Adjusted R2, MSE, AIC, and BIC, as shown in Table 1. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of regression models, including ANN models.

Additionally, the context mentions that the optimal numbers of hidden layers of an ANN model depend on the problem itself, and the over-fitting problem can occur at any instance. This suggests that the model performance is monitored during training to avoid over-fitting and to determine the optimal model architecture.

It is also mentioned that repeated training and testing are necessary to develop an optimal neural network and attain highly accurate predictions. This implies that the model performance is evaluated through a process of trial and error, with the goal of optimizing the model's architecture and hyperparameters.

However, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, such as the use of validation sets or early stopping, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
