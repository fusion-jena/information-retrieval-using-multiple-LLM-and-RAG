Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the optimization of parameters, and the results of the proposed model. It discusses the implications of the model on wildlife research and its advantages, such as being low time-consuming and able to be trained on CPU. However, it does not provide information on the postprocessing steps, such as the calculation of metrics, creation of saliency maps, or generation of confusion matrices. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
