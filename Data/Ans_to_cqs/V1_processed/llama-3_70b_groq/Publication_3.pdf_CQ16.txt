The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that the authors explored different numbers of training steps and compared results to find an optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. It is stated that for all challenges except Challenge 3, 4000 training steps were chosen as the optimum number, and for Challenge 3, 8000 training steps were chosen. However, it does not provide information on how they determined that the training was complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
