Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for retrieving plant functional traits from RGB photographs, and the performance of different CNN models in this task.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to employ strategies to handle randomness, such as setting a fixed random seed value, to ensure reproducibility of results. This is not mentioned in the provided context, and therefore, I do not know the specific strategies employed in this particular study to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
