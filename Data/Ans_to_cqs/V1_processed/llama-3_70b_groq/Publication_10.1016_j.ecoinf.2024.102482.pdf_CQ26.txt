Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning technology to predict water quality parameters and biomonitoring data for water quality pollution detection. It also discusses the design of a model structure for real-time predictions and cites various research papers on related topics.

The context does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, to address data bias. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
