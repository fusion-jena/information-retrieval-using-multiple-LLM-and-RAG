The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models (ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and ViT) for otolith age determination and discusses their architectures, hyperparameters, and performance.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of specific optimizers (AdamW and Adam) and learning rates for different models, which might be related to handling randomness in the optimization process. Additionally, the context mentions the use of class weights in the cross-entropy loss function to handle dataset imbalance, which could be seen as a strategy to reduce the impact of randomness in the training process.

However, without further information, it is not possible to determine if any specific strategies were employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
