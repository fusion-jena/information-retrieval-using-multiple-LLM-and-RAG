Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on discussing the challenges of data requirements for monitoring applications, particularly in bioacoustics, and presents results from experiments using different noise reduction techniques. It does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
