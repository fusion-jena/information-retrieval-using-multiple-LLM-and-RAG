Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text focuses on describing the classification process, pre-processing, and classification experiments, but it does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
