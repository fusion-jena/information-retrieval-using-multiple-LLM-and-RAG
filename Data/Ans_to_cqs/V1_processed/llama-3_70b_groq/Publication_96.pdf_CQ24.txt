Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Landsat 8 imagery and Google Cloud computing.

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and random dropout. By setting a random seed value, researchers can ensure that their results are reproducible and comparable across different runs of the experiment.

In the context of this study, it is likely that the authors employed some strategy to handle randomness, but it is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
