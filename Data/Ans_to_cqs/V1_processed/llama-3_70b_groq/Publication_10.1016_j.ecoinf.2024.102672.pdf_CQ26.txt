Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the design of machine learning models for predicting stratification status and thermocline depth in a reservoir, as well as the use of open data sources. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context. If you have any further information or context, I may be able to help you better.
