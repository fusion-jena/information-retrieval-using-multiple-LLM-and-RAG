Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are accuracy and correct percentage. 

In Table 6, the correct prediction rate for "present" and "absent" are reported, as well as the overall validation accuracy. Similarly, in Table 11, the correct prediction rate for "present" and "absent" are reported, along with the overall validation accuracy. 

In Table 4, which is a classification table, the correct percentage and overall percentage are reported. 

There is no mention of precision, recall, F1-score, or other common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. The context only mentions accuracy and correct percentage as the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
