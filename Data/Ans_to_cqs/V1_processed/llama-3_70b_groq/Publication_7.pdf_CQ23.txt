The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a large dataset, ImageNet, which is a diverse dataset. This could help in improving the model's generalizability. Additionally, the model was fine-tuned on a domain-specific dataset, Benthoz15, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This fine-tuning process could also contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. It is unclear whether these techniques were used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these measures were taken.
