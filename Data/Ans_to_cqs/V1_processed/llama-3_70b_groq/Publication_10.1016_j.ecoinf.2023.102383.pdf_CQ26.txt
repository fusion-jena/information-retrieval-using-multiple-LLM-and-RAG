The provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the feature pyramid network (FPN) used for object detection, particularly in UAV thermal images. It discusses the limitations of CNNs in detecting small objects due to downsampling and the benefits of using FPN to combine feature maps from different layers.

The query mentions various techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. However, these techniques are not mentioned or discussed in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer based on the given context.

If you are looking for information on techniques to address data bias, I can provide general information on the mentioned techniques. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets based on class labels to ensure each subset has a similar class distribution. Oversampling involves creating additional samples from the minority class to balance the class distribution. Undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the class distribution. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources or environments to increase diversity and reduce bias. However, these techniques are not discussed in the provided context.
