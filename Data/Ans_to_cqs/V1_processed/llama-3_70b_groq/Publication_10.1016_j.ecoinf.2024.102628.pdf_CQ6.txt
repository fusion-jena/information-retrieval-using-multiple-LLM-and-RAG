Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the model architecture, training process, and cross-validation approach, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the context mentions the use of a Convolutional Autoencoder to extract critical features and minimize noise within the training data. This suggests that the data might have undergone some form of preprocessing, but the specific steps are not mentioned.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
