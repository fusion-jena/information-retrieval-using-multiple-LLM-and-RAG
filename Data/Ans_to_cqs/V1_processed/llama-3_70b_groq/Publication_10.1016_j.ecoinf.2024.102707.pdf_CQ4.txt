Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only mentions that the authors used many different sets of hyper-parameters in YOLOv6 but found only marginal improvements, and decided to use the default settings. It also mentions testing with different spatial resolutions of the imagery, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
