The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as one of the well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the text mentions a 6570-picture dataset, which is divided into a random subset of 5256 pictures (80% of the total dataset) for training and the remaining 1314 pictures for testing. This dataset is specific to the task of identifying triatomine genera (Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius) from low-resolution pictures taken with ordinary cellphone cameras.
