The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, the use of dropout and batch normalization layers to reduce overfitting, and the optimization of hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

It is worth noting that the context mentions the use of a U-Net model implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python, which uses a ResNet-50 backbone pretrained on ImageNet. This might imply that the input data is already preprocessed in some way, but the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

In general, preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important for deep learning models, but the context does not provide specific information on these steps.
