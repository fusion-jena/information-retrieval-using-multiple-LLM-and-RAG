I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the TPEBO algorithm, hyperparameter optimization, and the structure of the LSTM neural network, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
