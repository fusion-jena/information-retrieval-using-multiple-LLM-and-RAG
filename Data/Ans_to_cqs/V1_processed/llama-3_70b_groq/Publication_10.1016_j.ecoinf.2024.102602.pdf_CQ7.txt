The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the models. In each iteration of the 5-fold cross-validation, one subset was used for evaluation, and the remaining 4 subsets were used for training (90% of the images) and validation (10% of the images). This implies that the data was split into 5 subsets, and each subset was used for evaluation in one of the iterations. The remaining subsets were used for training and validation, with a 90:10 ratio.
