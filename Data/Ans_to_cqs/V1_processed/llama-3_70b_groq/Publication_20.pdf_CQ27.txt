Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the training process, architecture, and hyperparameters used, as well as the evaluation of the model's performance. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
