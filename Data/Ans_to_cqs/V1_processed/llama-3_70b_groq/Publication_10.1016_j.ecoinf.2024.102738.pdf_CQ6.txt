Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification using Random Forest and spectral indices, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it's worth noting that the context does mention the calculation of spectral indices such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, BSI, MNDWI, and NDMI, which might be used as inputs to a machine learning or deep learning model. Additionally, the context discusses sampling strategies for training and testing datasets, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps specific to deep learning models.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
