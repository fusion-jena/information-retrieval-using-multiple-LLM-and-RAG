Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text only mentions that the model was selected based on the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set, but it does not specify which metrics were used to measure this performance. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It is possible that the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance are discussed in section 2.5.2, which is referenced in the text, but this information is not available in the provided context.
