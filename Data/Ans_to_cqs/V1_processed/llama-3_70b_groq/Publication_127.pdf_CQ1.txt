Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are used to collect raw data in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the references to camera trap data, camera trap studies, and camera-trap images throughout the text. Additionally, there are mentions of track surveys and line transect census, which may also be used to collect data. However, it is not clear if these methods are directly used in the deep learning pipeline or if they are used in conjunction with camera trap data. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used to collect raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
