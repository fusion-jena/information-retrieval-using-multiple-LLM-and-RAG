I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions various deep learning models and architectures, such as Faster R-CNN, FCRN, and others, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used.
