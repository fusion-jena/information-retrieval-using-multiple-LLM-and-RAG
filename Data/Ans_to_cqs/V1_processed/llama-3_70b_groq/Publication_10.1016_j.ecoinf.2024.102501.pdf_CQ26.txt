The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. 

However, it does mention that the data was normalized to reduce the impact of large differences in dimension and magnitude values of various parameters, which can lead to problems such as substantial noise interference, large fluctuations, strong concealment, and difficulty in data handling. The normalization formula is provided in Eq. (1). Additionally, standardization is mentioned, with the formula provided in Eq. (2). 

It also mentions the use of principal component analysis (PCA), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost to select key factors for input data, thereby reducing data dimensionality and information redundancy, to improve the predictive performance of DO models. Clustering algorithms are used to group datasets with different periodic changes, and the grouped datasets are modeled separately. 

Furthermore, methods such as empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform (WT) are used for denoising and feature extraction from raw time series data. 

While these techniques can help improve the quality of the data and the performance of the models, they do not specifically address data bias. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the techniques mentioned in the query are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
