I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to a study on classification models, feature selection, and data fusion, but it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The models mentioned in the context, such as LightGBM, RF, and AdaBoost, are not deep learning models, and their hyperparameters are not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
