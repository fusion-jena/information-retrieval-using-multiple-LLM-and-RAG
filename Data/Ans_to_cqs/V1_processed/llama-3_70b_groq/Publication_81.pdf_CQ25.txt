The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for fish classification from different families based on DNA barcode sequences. The proposed model, named ESK, combines Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to classify fish from different families. The EN-SAE is used to learn deep features and obtain the outgroup score of each fish, and then KDE is used to select a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classify the fish.
