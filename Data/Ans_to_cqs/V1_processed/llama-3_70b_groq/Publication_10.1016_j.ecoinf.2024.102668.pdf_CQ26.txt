The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the preprocessing approach to tackle issues related to recording devices in ecoacoustic data analysis, but it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias.

However, it mentions that the proposed preprocessing methodology consists of three steps (Fig. 2), but it does not elaborate on these steps. It also mentions the use of specific metrics (K-S and DKL) to quantify the effectiveness of bias reduction strategies, but it does not provide details on how these metrics are used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, as this information is not provided in the context.
