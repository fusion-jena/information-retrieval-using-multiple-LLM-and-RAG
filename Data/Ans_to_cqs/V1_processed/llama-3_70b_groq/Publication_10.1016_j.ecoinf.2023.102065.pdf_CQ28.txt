I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. It mentions various research papers and references, but none of them mention the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
