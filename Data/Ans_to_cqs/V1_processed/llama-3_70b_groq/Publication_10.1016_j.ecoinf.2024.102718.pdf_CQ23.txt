Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, data acquisition, and performance evaluation on specific datasets (PlantVillage and Dhan-Shomadhan). It does not provide information on techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
