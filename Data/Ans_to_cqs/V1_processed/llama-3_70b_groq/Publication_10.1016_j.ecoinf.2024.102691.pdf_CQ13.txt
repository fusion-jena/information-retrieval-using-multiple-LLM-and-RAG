According to the provided context, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

* Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Initial learning rate: 0.01
* Cycle learning rate: 0.2

These hyperparameters were used during model training, where the input image size was set to 512 Ã— 512 and the maximum batch size was limited to 4.
