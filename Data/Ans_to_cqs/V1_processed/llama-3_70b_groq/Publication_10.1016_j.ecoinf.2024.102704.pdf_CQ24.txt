Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on various deep learning models, their applications, and performance evaluations. It does not discuss the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention a "random selection process" in one of the papers, which was used to divide a dataset into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio. This implies that randomness is involved in the data preparation step, but it does not provide insight into how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines involves techniques such as fixing random seeds, using reproducible random number generators, and controlling sources of randomness in the data and model initialization. However, these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
