Based on the provided context, one technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is data augmentation. Data augmentation is a technique for expanding a data set without acquiring additional data. By applying transformations to the existing data, new images are generated that are slightly different while maintaining the same class. This technique is used to balance the data, particularly when the training set is unbalanced (classes with a significantly larger number of examples), which can cause the trained models to become biased towards larger classes. Augmentation can be used to increase the data for the classes with less representation, allowing all classes to be learned in a uniform manner.

The context does not explicitly mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that these techniques are used to address data bias in this specific context. However, it is worth noting that data augmentation is a common technique used to address data bias and imbalance in deep learning pipelines.
