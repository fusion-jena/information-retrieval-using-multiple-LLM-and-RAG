I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to a study on whale sightings and vocalizations, and it provides information on data analysis, visual sightings, and song patterns. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment.
