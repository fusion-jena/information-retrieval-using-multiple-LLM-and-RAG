I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses various deep learning models and their performances on seagrass coverage estimation and other computer vision tasks, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
