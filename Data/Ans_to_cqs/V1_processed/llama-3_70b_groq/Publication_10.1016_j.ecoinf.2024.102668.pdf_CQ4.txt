I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to acoustic signal processing, audio recording devices, and ecological monitoring, but it does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision tasks, but they may not be applicable to audio signal processing. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
