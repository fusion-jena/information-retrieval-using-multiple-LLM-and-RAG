The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few datasets related to pest image classification and detection. 

One of the datasets mentioned is the "Pest24" dataset, which consists of 25,378 annotated images coming from 24 pest species, collected by an automatic imaging trap. Another dataset is the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which is a popular object detection benchmarking dataset.

It is also mentioned that data were acquired by multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses under varying lighting environments, but it is not clear if this data is part of a specific dataset.

In summary, the datasets mentioned in the context are "Pest24" and COCO, but it does not mention MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
