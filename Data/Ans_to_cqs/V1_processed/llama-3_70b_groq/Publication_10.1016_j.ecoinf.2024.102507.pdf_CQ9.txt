I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the results of applying the original, reduced, and augmented datasets to a deep learning model, and outlines the overall study process, including data preparation, model building, compilation, training, and testing. However, it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) where the data is stored.
