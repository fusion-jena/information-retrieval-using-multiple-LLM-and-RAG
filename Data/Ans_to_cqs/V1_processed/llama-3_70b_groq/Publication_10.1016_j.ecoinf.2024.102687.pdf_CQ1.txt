Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of pre-trained CNN backbones, meta-learning algorithms, and energy consumption analysis in the context of eco-acoustics and bird sound classification.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data might be in the form of audio recordings or spectrograms of bird sounds, as mentioned in the context. But the specific methods used for collecting these recordings or data are not mentioned.

It is possible that the data collection methods might include surveys, sensors, or public datasets, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.
