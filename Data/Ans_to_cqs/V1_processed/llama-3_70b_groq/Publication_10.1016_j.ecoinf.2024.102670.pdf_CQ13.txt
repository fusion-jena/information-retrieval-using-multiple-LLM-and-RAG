The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the application of deep learning models to image analysis tasks, such as karyotyping images of chromosomes and analyzing 3D volumetric images, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
