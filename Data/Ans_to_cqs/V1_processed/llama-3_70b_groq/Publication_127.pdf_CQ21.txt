The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention that the confusion matrix for the best model (VGG) is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S10. This suggests that the calculation of the confusion matrix is one of the postprocessing steps involved. 

Additionally, the context mentions "Prediction Averaging" as a method to further improve classification accuracy, which involves averaging the predictions of an ensemble of models. This can be considered as a postprocessing step.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or other metrics calculation as postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not know if these steps are involved or not.
