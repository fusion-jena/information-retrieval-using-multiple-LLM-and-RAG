The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through a feedback mechanism, which involves the user in the optimization of the system. This is known as active learning. The system will, at certain intervals, forward images to humans, and after annotation, these images will be used to train a classifier iteratively. Evaluation is carried out with a retained test set of images annotated manually. This approach allows the model to improve its performance over time by exploiting data recorded during operation.
