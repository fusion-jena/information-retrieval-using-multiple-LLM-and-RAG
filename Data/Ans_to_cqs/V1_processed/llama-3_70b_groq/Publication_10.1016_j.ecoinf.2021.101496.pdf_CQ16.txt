I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training completion criteria, validation loss plateau, or any related concepts. The context appears to be focused on plant chlorophyll content, remote sensing, and agricultural research, with discussions on SPAD-502, chlorophyll index, and modeling techniques. There is no mention of machine learning or deep learning concepts, which are typically associated with training completion criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
