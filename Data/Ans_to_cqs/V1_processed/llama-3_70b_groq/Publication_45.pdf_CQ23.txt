Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the evaluation of hyper-parameters such as network capacity, regularization techniques, loss function, and optimizer, but it does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
