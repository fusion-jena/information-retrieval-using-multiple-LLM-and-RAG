The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only provides the criteria for annotating fish in images, which are:

1. Annotate a fish only if there is no > 10% of its surface covered by another object.
2. Annotate a fish only if it can be identified at the species level in the frame.
3. Annotate a fish only if its apparent size is larger than 3000 squared pixels.

These criteria suggest that the annotation process involves identifying and labeling fish species in images, but it does not specify the annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the specific annotation techniques used in this pipeline.
