I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the relationship between carbon emissions and GDP, and proposes a novel transfer learning methodology to predict GDP using carbon emission data. It does not provide information about a data repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
