Based on the provided context, it appears that time-lapse cameras are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. This is inferred from the mention of "camera trap images" and "time-lapse camera" in the abstract and references. It can be assumed that these cameras are used to capture images of Arctic wildlife, which are then used as input data for the deep learning model.

No other methods, such as surveys or sensors, are mentioned in the provided context. Additionally, there is no mention of public datasets being used as a source of raw data. Therefore, it can be concluded that time-lapse cameras are the primary method used for collecting raw data in this specific deep learning pipeline.
