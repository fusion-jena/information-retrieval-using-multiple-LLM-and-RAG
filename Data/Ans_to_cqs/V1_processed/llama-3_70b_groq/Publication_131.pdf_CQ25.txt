The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. This is evident from the context, which describes a CNN classification system designed to classify anuran calls (sounds). The model is trained on a dataset of audio samples, and the softmax layer has a number of units equal to the number of classes (types of sounds) to be classified. The goal is to classify each audio sample into one of the classes, indicating the type of anuran call it represents.
