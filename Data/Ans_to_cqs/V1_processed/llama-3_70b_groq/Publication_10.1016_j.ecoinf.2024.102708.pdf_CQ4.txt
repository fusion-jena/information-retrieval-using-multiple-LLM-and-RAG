The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are Flip, Crop, Contrast Shift, Translation, and Rotation. These augmentations were applied in a random order to increase the size of the training dataset. The specific parameters for each augmentation are as follows: Flip (no specific parameters mentioned), Crop (minimum 20% and maximum 25%), Contrast Shift (minimum -10% and maximum +50%), Translation (minimum 0 and maximum 20%), and Rotation (minimum -90° and maximum +90°).
