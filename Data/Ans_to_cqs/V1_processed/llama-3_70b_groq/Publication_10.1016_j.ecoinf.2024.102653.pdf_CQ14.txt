The query asks how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. According to the provided context, the hyperparameters were optimized through "meticulous manual tuning" (Section 2.4). There is no mention of grid search, random search, or any other automated hyperparameter optimization method. It appears that the authors manually tried different combinations of hyperparameters to achieve the best performance metrics, and the selected hyperparameters are presented in Table 1.
