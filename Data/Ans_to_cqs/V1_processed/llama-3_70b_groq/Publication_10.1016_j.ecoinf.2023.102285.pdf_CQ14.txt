I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to a specific model or system for detecting objects in the ocean surface, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. The tables and equations provided seem to be related to the evaluation of the model's performance, but they do not shed light on the hyperparameter optimization method used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
