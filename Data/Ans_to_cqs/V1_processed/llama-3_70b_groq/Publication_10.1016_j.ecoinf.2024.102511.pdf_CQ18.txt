Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the importance of accurate classification, the limitations of BANTER, and the requirements for reliable training data. It does not provide information on how to monitor model performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
