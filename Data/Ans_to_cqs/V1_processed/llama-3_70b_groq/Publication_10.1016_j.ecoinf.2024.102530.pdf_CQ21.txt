Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the methodology and implementation of the Apis-FIS model for mapping suitable areas for beekeeping, including the rules and fuzzy logic toolbox used. It also mentions the validation of the model but does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
