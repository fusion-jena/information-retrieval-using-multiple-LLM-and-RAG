The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention a "one-cycle learning rate policy" with a minimum of 0.000001 and a maximum of 0.001. This suggests that the learning rate is dynamically adjusted during training, but the specific optimization algorithm used is not specified. Therefore, I don't know the exact optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline.
