The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search. This is mentioned in the context as "Grid search: C = {10−4; 10−3; 10−2; 10−1;1;10;100}; solver = {sag; saga; lbfgs}". This indicates that a grid search is performed over a range of values for the regularization strength (C) and three different solvers (sag, saga, and lbfgs) are used to optimize the model.
