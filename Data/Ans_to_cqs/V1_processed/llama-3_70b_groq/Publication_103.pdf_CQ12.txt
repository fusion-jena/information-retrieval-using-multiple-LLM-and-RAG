The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of the modified GoogleNet model, Inception modules, and the use of the Caffe framework, which are all related to CNNs. Additionally, the context mentions image classification tasks, such as herbarium specimen classification and transfer learning, which are typical applications of CNNs.
