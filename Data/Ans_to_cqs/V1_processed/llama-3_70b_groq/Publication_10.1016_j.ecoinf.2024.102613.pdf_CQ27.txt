I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to focus on the architecture design and deployment view of a smart farming system, discussing the deployment of modules to hardware and the deployment view of specific case studies (smart dairy farming and fish farming). There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
