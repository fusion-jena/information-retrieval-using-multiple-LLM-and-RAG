Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that some of the postprocessing steps might include the calculation of performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve, as these metrics are mentioned in the context of evaluating the model's performance.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a confusion matrix, which is a common postprocessing step in machine learning to evaluate the model's performance. However, there is no mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps.

Therefore, the answer is that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are likely to include the calculation of performance metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix, but the exact steps are not specified in the provided context.
