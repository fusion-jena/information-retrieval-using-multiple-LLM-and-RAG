I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and remote sensing applications, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
