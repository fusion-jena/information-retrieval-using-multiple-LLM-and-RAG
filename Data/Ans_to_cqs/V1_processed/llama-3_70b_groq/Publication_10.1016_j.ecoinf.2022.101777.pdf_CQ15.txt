The provided context does not mention any optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be discussing a Random Forest (RF) classification approach, which is a machine learning technique, but not specifically deep learning. There is no mention of optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
