Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the references to camera trap images and the mention of camera trap data in the text. Specifically, the article "Ungulate detection and species classification from camera trap images using RetinaNet and faster R-CNN" by Vecvanags et al. (2022) suggests that camera traps are used to collect images of wildlife, which are then used for species classification and detection.

Additionally, the mention of aerial survey images in the article "A comparison of deep learning and citizen science techniques for counting wildlife in aerial survey images" by Torney et al. (2019) implies that aerial surveys may also be used as a method for collecting raw data.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide information on the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets for collecting raw data. Therefore, it is unclear whether these methods are utilized in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, based on the provided context, camera traps and aerial surveys appear to be methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
