Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of computer vision techniques, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT), for facial recognition of sika deer. It discusses the architecture and performance of the model, but it does not provide information about the datasets used for training or testing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
