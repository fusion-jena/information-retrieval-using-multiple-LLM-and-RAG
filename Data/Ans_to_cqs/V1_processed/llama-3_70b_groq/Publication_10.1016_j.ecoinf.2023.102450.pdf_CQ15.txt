Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on animal tracking, wildlife videos, and deep learning techniques for detection and motion monitoring. It discusses the use of few-shot learning, Siamese networks, and YOLOv4, but does not provide information on optimization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
