The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the calculation of loss and bias during training and validation. The context mentions that the best model with transfer learning was chosen based on the minimum total loss after nine epochs, and that overfitting is observed after nine epochs, where the validation loss starts to increase. This suggests that the model performance is being monitored through the evaluation of loss and bias during training and validation.
