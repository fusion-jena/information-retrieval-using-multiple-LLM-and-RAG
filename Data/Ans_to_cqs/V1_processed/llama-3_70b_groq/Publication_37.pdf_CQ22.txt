Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is classification accuracy. This is mentioned in the text as "the methods compared in this study are evaluated in terms of classification accuracy." Additionally, the results are reported as a box-plot generated from the per-fold accuracies, and the mean accuracies are indicated by red squares in Figure 1. There is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that classification accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this study.
