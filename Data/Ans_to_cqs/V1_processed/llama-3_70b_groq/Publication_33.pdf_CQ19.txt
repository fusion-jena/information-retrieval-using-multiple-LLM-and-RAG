The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework is used to build the deep learning model. However, it does reference a paper about TensorFlow (reference 43), which suggests that TensorFlow might be used. But it does not rule out the possibility of other frameworks being used as well. Therefore, I don't know the exact framework used to build the deep learning model, but TensorFlow is a possibility.
