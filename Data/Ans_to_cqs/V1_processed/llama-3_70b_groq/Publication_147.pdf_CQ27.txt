Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the training and prediction times of the models, the input variables used, and the hardware used for training and prediction. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
