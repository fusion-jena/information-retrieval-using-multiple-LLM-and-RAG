The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of metrics such as accuracy and error_rate. These metrics are specified in the cnn_learner function as `metrics = list(accuracy, error_rate)`. This means that during training, the model's performance will be evaluated based on its accuracy and error rate on the validation set. The model's performance on these metrics will be tracked and reported after each epoch. Additionally, the model is saved after each epoch using the SaveModelCallback function, which allows for later evaluation of the model's performance at different stages of training.
