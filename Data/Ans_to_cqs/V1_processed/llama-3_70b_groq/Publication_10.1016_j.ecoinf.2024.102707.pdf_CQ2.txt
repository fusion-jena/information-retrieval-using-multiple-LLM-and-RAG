Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions "imagery" and "images" which suggests that image data is used, but it does not specify the format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF). There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats. Therefore, I don't know the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
