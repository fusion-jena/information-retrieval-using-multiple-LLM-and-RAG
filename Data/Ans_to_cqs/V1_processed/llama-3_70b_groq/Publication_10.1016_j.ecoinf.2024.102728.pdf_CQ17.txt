I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecology, geography, and archaeology, with references to papers and datasets related to these fields. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
