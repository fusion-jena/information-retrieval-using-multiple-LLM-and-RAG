The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context primarily focuses on research papers and studies related to animal individual recognition, fish recognition, and underwater target detection using deep learning techniques.

However, it does mention a dataset called Arcface_Mask, which is not a well-known dataset like MNIST or ImageNet. It appears to be a custom dataset created for a specific study.

In general, the choice of dataset depends on the specific problem or application being addressed. For example, MNIST is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition, while CIFAR and ImageNet are used for image classification tasks. In the context of animal individual recognition, custom datasets are often created to suit the specific requirements of the study.

Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
