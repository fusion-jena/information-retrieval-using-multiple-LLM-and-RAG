The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors have taken some steps to minimize the presence of mislabeled images in the Google Image Search dataset.

For instance, they have chosen only the most popular labels and retrieved the top results from Google Image Search, which is expected to reduce the presence of mislabeled images. Additionally, they have applied standard data augmentation techniques such as shear, translation, and mirroring during training, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's robustness to different image variations.

However, it is not clear if they have used techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. These techniques are commonly used to handle imbalanced datasets or to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse range of images, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
