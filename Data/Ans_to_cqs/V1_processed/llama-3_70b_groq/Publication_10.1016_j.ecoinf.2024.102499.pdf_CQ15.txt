The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions the learning rate (0.008) and the cosine learning rate decay. However, it does not specify the optimization algorithm used, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
