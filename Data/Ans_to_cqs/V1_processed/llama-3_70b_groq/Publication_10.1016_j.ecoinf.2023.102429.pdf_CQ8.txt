I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a research paper or article in the field of ecological informatics, discussing the use of partial least-squares regression (PLSR) and other machine learning algorithms for soil nutrient concentration analysis. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository, nor is there any reference to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
