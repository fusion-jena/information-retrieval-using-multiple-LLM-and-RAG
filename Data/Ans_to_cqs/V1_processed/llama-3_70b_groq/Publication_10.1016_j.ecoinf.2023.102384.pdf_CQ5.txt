The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a few datasets related to agricultural pests, such as Pest24, which is a large-scale very small object dataset of agricultural pests for multi-target detection.

It is likely that the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context is focused on object detection and classification tasks related to agricultural pests, and therefore, the datasets used might be specific to this domain. Unfortunately, the context does not provide more information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
