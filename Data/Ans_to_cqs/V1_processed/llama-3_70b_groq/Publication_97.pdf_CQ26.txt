The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques used to improve the performance of deep learning models, such as batch normalization (Ioï¬€e & Szegedy, 2015) and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), which can help reduce overfitting and improve model robustness.

It does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to address class imbalance and data bias issues, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
