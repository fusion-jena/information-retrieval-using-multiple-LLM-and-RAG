I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be focused on the application of big-data mining approaches, including Artificial Intelligence models, to predict biodiversity changes and study the implications of climate change on ecosystem conservation. It discusses the use of these approaches to analyze species distribution patterns and trends, but does not delve into the specifics of deep learning pipeline optimization techniques.
