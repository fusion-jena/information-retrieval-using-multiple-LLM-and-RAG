I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses standardization of data, analysis of dependencies, and references to various studies on COVID-19 and air pollution, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation in a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
