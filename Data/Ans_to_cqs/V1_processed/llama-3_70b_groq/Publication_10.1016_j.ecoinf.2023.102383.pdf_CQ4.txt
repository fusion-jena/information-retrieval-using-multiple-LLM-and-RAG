Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on object detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), feature maps, and anchor boxes, but it does not discuss data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can help improve the robustness and accuracy of models. However, the provided context does not provide any information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
