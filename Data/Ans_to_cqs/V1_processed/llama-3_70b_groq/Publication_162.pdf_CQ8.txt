I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing the use of deep learning for fauna and flora monitoring, but it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
