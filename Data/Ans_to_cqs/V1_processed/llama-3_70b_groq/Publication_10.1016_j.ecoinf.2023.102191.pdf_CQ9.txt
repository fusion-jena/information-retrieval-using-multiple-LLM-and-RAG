I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The text appears to be discussing a citizen science project that uses a mobile app to collect biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or where the data is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
