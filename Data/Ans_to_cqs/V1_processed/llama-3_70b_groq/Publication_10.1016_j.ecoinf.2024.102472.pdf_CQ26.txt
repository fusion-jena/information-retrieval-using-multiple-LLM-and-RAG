The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for predicting carbon stocks and biomass. It discusses the tuning of hyperparameters, such as node size, gradient boosting iteration, and learning rate, but does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
