Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, including the optimization objective, network architecture, and training hyperparameters. It does not provide information on the preprocessing steps applied to the input data before feeding it into the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
