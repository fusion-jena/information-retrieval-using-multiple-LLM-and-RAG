I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to species distribution models, sampling bias, and environmental covariates, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
