I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of academic papers and references related to ecological informatics, water quality, and lake ecosystems. There is no mention of a deep learning model or any cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) being used to deploy such a model. The context seems to be focused on scientific research and studies in the field of ecology and environmental science, rather than on machine learning or cloud computing. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the necessary information is not present in the context.
