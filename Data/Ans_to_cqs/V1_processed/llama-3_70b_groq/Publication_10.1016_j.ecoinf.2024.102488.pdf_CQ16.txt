Based on the provided context, it appears that the criteria used to determine when training is complete is when the cross-validation accuracy reaches the highest level. This is mentioned in the feature selection process using Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV), where the process of feature pruning is repeated recursively until the cross-validation accuracy reaches the highest level. 

However, it does not explicitly mention the use of validation loss plateau as a criterion to determine when training is complete. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that validation loss plateau is used as a criterion in this specific context.
