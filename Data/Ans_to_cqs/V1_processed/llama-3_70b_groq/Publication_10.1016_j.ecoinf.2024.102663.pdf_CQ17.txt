The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of deep learning models for fish biomass estimation, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques used.

However, it does mention the use of Lasso and Ridge models, which are types of linear regression models that use L1 and L2 regularization, respectively, to prevent overfitting. But it does not mention their use in the context of deep learning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
