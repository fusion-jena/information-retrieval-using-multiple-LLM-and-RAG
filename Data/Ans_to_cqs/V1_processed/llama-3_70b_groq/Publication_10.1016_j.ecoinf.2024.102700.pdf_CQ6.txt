Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily discusses the use of machine learning techniques, including Maxent and deep learning strategies, in ecological informatics, but it does not delve into the preprocessing steps required for deep learning models.

The context focuses on the application of machine learning methodologies in species habitat use modeling, highlighting the increased use of machine learning techniques and the incorporation of anthropogenic variables in modeling. It also mentions the advantages of Maxent and its widespread use, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
