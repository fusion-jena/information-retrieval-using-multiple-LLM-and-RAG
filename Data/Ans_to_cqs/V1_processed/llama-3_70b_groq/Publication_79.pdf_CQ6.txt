Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for hierarchical mapping of Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) physiognomies using remote sensing data. It discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), data augmentation, and cross-validation approaches, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular study. However, in general, preprocessing steps may vary depending on the dataset and the specific requirements of the deep learning model. Common preprocessing steps include data normalization, feature scaling, handling missing values, and data cleaning.
