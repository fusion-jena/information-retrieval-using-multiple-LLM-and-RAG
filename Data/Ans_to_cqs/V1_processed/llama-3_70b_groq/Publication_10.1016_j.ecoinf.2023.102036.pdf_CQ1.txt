Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning in computer vision, particularly in the field of fisheries, and discusses the importance of big data and deep learning techniques in extracting high levels of representation of image content.

It does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
