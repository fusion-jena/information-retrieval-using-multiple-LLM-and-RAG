The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is semantic segmentation, specifically to locate and delineate artificial and natural objects in photos. This is evident from the mention of "semantic segmentation or pixel-wise classification" in the text, which aims to enable the model to identify and separate objects in images. Additionally, the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to improve the model's ability to capture fine details and precisely delineate objects further supports this purpose. The model is also used for feature matching and extracting meaningful information from images, but the primary goal is semantic segmentation.
