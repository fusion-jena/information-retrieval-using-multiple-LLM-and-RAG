I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be related to machine learning and classification models, but it does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques used for hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. The tables and text provided seem to focus on the results of the classification models with different features and window sizes, but do not discuss the optimization process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
