The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly mentioned in the context, specifically in the discussion section, where it is stated that "The CNN model (Fig. 2) is trained using a two-stage process." Additionally, the context also mentions the use of a ResNet-50 network architecture, which is a type of CNN architecture.
