Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on data-driven models, hyperparameter tuning, and automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques, including the use of AutoGluon and TabPFN. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
