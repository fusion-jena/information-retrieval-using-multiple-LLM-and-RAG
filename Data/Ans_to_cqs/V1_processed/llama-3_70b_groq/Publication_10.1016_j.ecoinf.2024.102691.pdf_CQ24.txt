Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of various object detection models, their architectures, and performance metrics. It discusses the training process, including the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, batch size, and learning rate, but does not provide information on handling randomness.

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and dropout. By setting a random seed value, the randomness is fixed, and the results can be reproduced.

In the absence of explicit information in the provided context, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
