I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of the Microsoft AI for Earth MegaDetector model in detecting wildlife in camera trap images from Arctic Alaska. It discusses the model's performance metrics, detection thresholds, and comparisons with manual human reviewers, but it does not provide information about the model's hyperparameters.
