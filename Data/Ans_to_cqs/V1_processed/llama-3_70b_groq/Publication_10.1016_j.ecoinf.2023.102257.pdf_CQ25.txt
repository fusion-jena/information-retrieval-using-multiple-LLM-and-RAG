The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically the MegaDetector model, is object detection. It produces bounding boxes around animals, people, and vehicles in remote camera imagery. This model is used to automate or accelerate the labor-intensive process of labeling (i.e., tagging) photos in wildlife monitoring.
