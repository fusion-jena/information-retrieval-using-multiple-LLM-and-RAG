Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the evaluation of Maxent models using AICc values and the selection of the best model based on the lowest AICc value. It also mentions the importance of considering model complexity and goodness-of-fit. However, it does not provide information on the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
