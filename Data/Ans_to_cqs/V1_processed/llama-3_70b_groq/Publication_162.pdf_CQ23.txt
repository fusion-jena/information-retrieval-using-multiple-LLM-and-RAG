The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that the model is trained on a dataset that includes instances of deers, which is the most common species in the RGB-D dataset. This suggests that the dataset may not be diverse in terms of species, but it is not clear if the dataset is diverse in other aspects, such as lighting conditions, camera angles, or environments.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model uses weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset. This may help improve the model's generalizability to some extent. However, without further information, it is unclear if any other measures were taken to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.

In summary, while the context provides some information about the dataset and pre-training, it does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
