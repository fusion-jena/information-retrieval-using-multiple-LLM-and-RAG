I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various papers and articles on topics such as object retrieval, ecology, and image processing, but it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
