The purpose of the deep learning model is sound identification or classification. The model is trained to identify sounds of different species from standardized recordings that are segmented into 3-s clips. The model uses YOLOv5s, a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection architecture, but in this case, it is used for sound classification rather than object detection. The model is trained on spectrograms, which are visual representations of audio signals, and is evaluated on its ability to correctly identify the sounds in the test datasets.
