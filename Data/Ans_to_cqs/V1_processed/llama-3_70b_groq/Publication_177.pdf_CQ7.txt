The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the original dataset was split into 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. This split is a common practice in deep learning, where the data is divided into three sets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during training, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The exact criteria for splitting the data in this specific case are not provided, but it is likely that the split was done randomly or using a stratified sampling method to ensure that the distribution of classes is similar across all three sets.
