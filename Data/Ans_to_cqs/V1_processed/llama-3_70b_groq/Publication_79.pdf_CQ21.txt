Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as the generation of a confusion matrix. This is evident from Table 5, which shows the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score for the first level of classification using the RGB+EVI2 dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions the generation of thematic maps, such as the ones shown in Fig. 8, which suggests that some form of visualization or mapping of the classification results is also involved in the postprocessing steps.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether saliency maps are involved in the postprocessing steps.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training appear to include metrics calculation and confusion matrix generation, as well as thematic map visualization. However, the involvement of saliency maps is unclear.
