Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it is mentioned that "data augmentation proved to be an efficient way to increase the F1 score" and that small changes in brightness and zoom can help improve results. Additionally, it is mentioned that medium or large changes in zoom range can cause degradation of results, suggesting that the authors are using zoom as a form of data augmentation.

There is no explicit mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors are collecting diverse data by collecting images in different seasons (autumn, winter, and spring) and using UAV flights at a constant height above ground.

It is also worth noting that the authors are using supervision from an expert (Janaina G. Arantes from the UFSCar HydroBiology Department) to identify invasive species and create ground truth data, which can help reduce bias in the dataset.

Overall, while the context does not provide an exhaustive list of techniques used to address data bias, it suggests that data augmentation and diverse data collection are used to mitigate bias in the deep learning pipeline.
