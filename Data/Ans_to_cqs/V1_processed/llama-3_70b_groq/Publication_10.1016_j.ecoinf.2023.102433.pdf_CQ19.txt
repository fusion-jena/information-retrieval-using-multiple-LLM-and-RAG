According to the provided context, the deep learning model in GEE can be performed using TensorFlow, which is a machine learning and artificial intelligence open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team. However, it does not allow the use of other open-source machine learning systems such as PyTorch, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), Caffe, or novel algorithms for deep learning.
