The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to plot the accuracy and loss curves over epochs. The accuracy curve shows the model's classification performance, and the loss curve measures the amount of error made by the model. By comparing the training and validation results over epochs, the model's performance can be monitored and evaluated. This is shown in Fig. 6, which displays two-line graphs, one for accuracy and one for loss, that compare the training and validation results over epochs. The data points on the graphs are based on the mathematical calculations that the proposed model performs on the data, and they are connected by lines to show the trend and pattern of the model's performance.
