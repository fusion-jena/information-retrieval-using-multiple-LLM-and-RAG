The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). RMSE measures the average difference between predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better model predictions. R2, calculated as the squared Pearson's correlation coefficient, measures the percentage of variation in the response variable explained by the model. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance on the training, validation, and test datasets.
