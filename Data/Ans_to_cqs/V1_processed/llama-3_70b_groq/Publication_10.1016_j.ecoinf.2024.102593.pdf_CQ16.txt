Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the use of active learning, model selection, and embeddings visualization (EV) in bioacoustic tasks, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

The context does mention the use of performance metrics, such as statistical comparisons between model predictions and known classes, to guide decision-making in model selection. However, it does not specify whether these metrics are used to determine when training is complete.

Common criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau, are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given information.
