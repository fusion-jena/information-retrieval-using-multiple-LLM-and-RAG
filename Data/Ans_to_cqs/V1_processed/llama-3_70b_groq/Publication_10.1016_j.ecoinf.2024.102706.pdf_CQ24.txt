Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models, specifically gradient boosting models like LightGBM and XGBoost, and their applications in predicting forest canopy cover. It discusses the advantages of these models, their hyperparameters, and their performance in comparison to other machine learning models. However, it does not touch upon the topic of handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
