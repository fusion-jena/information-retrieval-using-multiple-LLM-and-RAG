I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be related to a research study involving species distribution modeling and machine learning, but it does not provide information about the availability of the data or the pipeline in a public repository. The references cited are academic papers and do not seem to be related to data repositories. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
