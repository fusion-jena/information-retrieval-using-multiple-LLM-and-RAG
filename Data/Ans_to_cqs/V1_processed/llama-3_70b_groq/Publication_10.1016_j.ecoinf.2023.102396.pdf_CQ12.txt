I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, nor does it specify the type of model used in the pipeline. The keywords mentioned in the abstract, such as "Machine learning", "Hierarchical clustering", and "State space model", suggest that the authors may have used some type of machine learning or statistical model, but there is no indication of a specific deep learning model being used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
