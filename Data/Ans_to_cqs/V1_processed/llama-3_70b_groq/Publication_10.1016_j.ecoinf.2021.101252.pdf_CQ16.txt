According to the provided context, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is when no increase in validation performance (Bv) is observed after 25 epochs. This means that the model is trained until the validation performance plateaus, and then the training is stopped. This approach is used to avoid overfitting and to identify the optimal number of training epochs that provides the best validation performance.
