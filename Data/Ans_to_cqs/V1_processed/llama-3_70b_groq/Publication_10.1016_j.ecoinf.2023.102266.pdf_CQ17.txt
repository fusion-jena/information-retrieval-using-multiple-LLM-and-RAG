The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing a Monte Carlo method-based classification model for predicting real-world phenomena like wildfire spreads or pest plant propagation, and its limitations and potential improvements. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
