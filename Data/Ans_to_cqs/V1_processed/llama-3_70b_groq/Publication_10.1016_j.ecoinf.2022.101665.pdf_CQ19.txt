I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or any specific frameworks used to build them, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be focused on machine learning, geostatistics, and map evaluation, but it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used for building deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
