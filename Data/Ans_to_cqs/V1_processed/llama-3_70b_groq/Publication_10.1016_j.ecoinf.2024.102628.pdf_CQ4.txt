The provided context does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of multi-temporal data, transfer learning, and the Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation approach, but it does not discuss specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
