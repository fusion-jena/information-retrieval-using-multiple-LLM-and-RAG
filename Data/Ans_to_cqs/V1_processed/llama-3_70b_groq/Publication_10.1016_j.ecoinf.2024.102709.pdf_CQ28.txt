I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the model's performance, the use of k-fold cross-validation, and the Python library scikit-learn, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the model.
