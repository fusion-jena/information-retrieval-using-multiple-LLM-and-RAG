Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the classification accuracy assessments, hyperparameter tuning, and the pixel-based approach used in the study. It discusses the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning but does not specify the stopping criteria for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
