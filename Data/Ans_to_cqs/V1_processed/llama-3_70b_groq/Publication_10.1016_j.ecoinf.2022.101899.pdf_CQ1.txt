Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the application of deep learning in wildfire event prediction in Australia, discussing the use of deep learning technology to estimate the best optimizer selection methods and seasonal prediction systems. However, it does not provide information on the data collection methods.

The only hint about data collection is in the context of Halgamuge et al. (2020), which mentions that they "developed an algorithm to collect the data automatically." However, it does not specify what type of data or how it was collected.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of reports, Royal Commission reports, and environmental expert knowledge as sources of information, but it is unclear if these sources were used for data collection or for other purposes.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
