Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It does provide information about the number of training, validation, and out-of-sample test images, as well as the number of new images selected for model retraining. However, it does not specify whether a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
