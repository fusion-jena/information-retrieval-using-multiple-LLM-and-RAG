I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the active learning pipeline, the MegaDetector model, and the NACTI dataset, but it does not provide information about where the data repository is available. It does not mention Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
