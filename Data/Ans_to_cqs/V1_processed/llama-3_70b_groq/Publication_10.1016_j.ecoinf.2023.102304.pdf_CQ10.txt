I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of research papers and their corresponding information, such as authors, publication years, and methods used. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The context seems to be focused on remote sensing and environmental research, and it does not provide any information about a specific code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
