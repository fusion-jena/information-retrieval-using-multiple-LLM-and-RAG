The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation being applied only to the training data to avoid overlapping the same data in different partitions. This suggests that data augmentation is used to add heterogeneous information to the training procedure, but it does not specifically address data bias.

The context also mentions that the dataset was divided into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) subsets for model evaluation and hyperparameter search, but it does not specify whether stratified splitting or other techniques were used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
