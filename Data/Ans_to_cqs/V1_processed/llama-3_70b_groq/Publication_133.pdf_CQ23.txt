The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of validation data, which is set aside during training and used to monitor the model's performance. This suggests that some form of validation or testing was performed to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained for 30 epochs per training task, based on validation runs. This implies that the model's performance was evaluated on the validation set after each epoch, and the training process was stopped when the model's performance on the validation set was satisfactory.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. It is possible that these measures were taken, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
