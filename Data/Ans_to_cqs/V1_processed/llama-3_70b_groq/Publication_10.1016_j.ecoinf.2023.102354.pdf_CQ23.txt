Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms to understand groundwater-climate interactions and their implications within the GAB region. It discusses the data sources, spatial and temporal resolutions, and categories used in the study, but it does not provide information on the model's generalizability measures. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
