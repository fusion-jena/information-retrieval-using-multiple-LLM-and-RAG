The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention the use of Random Search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization algorithms for hyperparameter optimization. 

Random Search is a simple and efficient method for hyperparameter tuning, which involves randomly sampling the hyperparameter space. This method can help mitigate the effects of randomness in the deep learning pipeline by exploring different hyperparameter settings.

Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization are also methods that can help handle randomness by iteratively searching for the optimal hyperparameters. These methods can adapt to the randomness in the pipeline by adjusting the hyperparameters based on the model's performance.

However, the context does not provide specific information on how to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. Therefore, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
