Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the processing and analysis of acoustic data, particularly in the context of bird species distribution modeling and bioacoustics studies.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data in these studies likely consists of audio recordings, which are then processed and analyzed using various techniques, such as automated and manual recognition, and deep learning approaches. The context does not provide information on how these audio recordings are collected, but it is possible that they are obtained through field surveys, acoustic sensors, or public datasets.

Without further information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer to this query.
