The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, nor does it specify the metrics used to evaluate its performance. The context discusses the evaluation of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) using metrics such as AUC, maxTSS, and CBI, which are used to measure predictive accuracy. However, it does not mention the evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
