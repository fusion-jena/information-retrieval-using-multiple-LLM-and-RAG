The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. This is evident from the context, which mentions techniques such as auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, and filtering being applied to the dataset, which suggests that the dataset consists of images. Additionally, the context mentions the uniform size of the images as 640 Ã— 640 pixels, further supporting the conclusion that the data format is image.
