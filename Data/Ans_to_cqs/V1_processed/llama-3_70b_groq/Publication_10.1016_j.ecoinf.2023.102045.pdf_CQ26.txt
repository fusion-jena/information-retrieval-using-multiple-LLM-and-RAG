I don't know. The provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, mapping, and color gamut in the context of scientific communication, but it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or data bias mitigation techniques.
