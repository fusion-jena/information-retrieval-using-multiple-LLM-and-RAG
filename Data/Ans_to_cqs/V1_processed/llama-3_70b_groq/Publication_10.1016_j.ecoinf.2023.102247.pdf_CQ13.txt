I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context mentions the use of an ensemble modeling approach with four different models: one regression-based model (GLM), and three machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM). However, it does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
