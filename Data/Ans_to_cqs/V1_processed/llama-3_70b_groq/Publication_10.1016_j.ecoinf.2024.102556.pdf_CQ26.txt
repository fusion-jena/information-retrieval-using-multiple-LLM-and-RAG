The provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) scenario, discussing the limitations of the original SORT model and the improvements made by the Deep SORT model using Feature Extraction Networks (FENs). It also mentions the introduction of a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) to address the shortcomings of deeper networks.

There is no mention of data bias, preprocessing, or techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
