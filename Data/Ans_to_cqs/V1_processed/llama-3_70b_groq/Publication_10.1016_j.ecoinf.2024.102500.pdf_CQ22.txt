The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models. However, it does discuss the evaluation of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), LightGBM (LGBM), Gradient Boosting (GB), HistGradientBoosting (HGBM), and XGBoost (XGB), for predicting water quality parameters.

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these models include:

1. Coefficient of determination (R2)
2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
3. Mean Bias Error (MBE)
4. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
5. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)

These metrics are used to assess the models' predictive capabilities and accuracy. The context does not mention precision, recall, or F1-score, which are commonly used metrics in deep learning model evaluation.
