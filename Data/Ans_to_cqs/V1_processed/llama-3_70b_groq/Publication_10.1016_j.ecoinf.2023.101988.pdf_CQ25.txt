The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically for animal biodiversity monitoring using acoustic monitoring. This is mentioned in the paper "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al. (2021). The model is likely used to classify bird species based on their songs, as hinted by the mention of birdsong identification software such as Bird Song Id Australia and Raven Lite.
