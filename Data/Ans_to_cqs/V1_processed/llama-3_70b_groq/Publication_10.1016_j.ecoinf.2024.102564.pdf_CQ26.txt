I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or techniques to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context appears to be focused on machine learning methods, specifically Random Forest, for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, and does not provide information on addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
