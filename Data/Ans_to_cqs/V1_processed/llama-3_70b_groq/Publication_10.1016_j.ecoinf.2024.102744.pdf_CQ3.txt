Based on the provided context, it appears that the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is evident from the mention of "manually annotated subset" and "ground truth bounding boxes" in the text. Additionally, Figure 5 shows the distribution of the length and width of the bounding boxes in the VnPollenBee dataset, further supporting the use of bounding box annotation. There is no mention of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques in the provided context.
