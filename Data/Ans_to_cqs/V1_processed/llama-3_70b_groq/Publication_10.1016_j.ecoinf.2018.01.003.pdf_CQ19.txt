The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses the development of neural networks, Bayesian learning machines, and support vector machines, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
