I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The text mentions the use of an optimizer approach for feature selection and optimizing SVM parameters, but it does not provide information about a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
