Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The code snippet only shows the training process with 2 epochs, and the output of the training process, but it does not provide information about the stopping criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
