I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context discusses various research papers and methods related to coral reefs, fish, and marine ecosystems, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The mention of a deep learning model is only in the paper by Do and Tran (2023), but it does not specify the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
