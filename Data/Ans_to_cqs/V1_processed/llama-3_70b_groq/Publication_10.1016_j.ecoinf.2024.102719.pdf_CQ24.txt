Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on machine learning algorithms, their applications, and related concepts like bias-variance trade-off, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. 

However, it is worth noting that some of the referenced papers discuss techniques like cross-validation, which can help mitigate the effects of randomness in model evaluation. Additionally, the context mentions techniques like random forests and XGBoost, which are robust to some extent against randomness due to their ensemble nature. 

But, a specific discussion on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is not present in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.
