The training is considered complete when the validation loss remains constant for five epochs. At this point, the learning rate is reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner. There is no mention of a specific validation loss plateau, but rather a plateau in the sense that the validation loss does not decrease for five consecutive epochs.
