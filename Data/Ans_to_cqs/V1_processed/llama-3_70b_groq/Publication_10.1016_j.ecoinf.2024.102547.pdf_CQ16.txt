Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to a study on acoustic data analysis, and it provides various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R2, but it does not discuss the training process or the criteria for determining its completion.

Typically, in machine learning, the criteria for determining when training is complete can vary depending on the specific problem and the chosen algorithm. Some common criteria include:

* Validation loss plateau: When the validation loss stops improving or reaches a plateau, it may indicate that the model has converged, and training can be stopped.
* Convergence of model parameters: When the model parameters stop changing significantly, it may indicate that the model has converged, and training can be stopped.
* Maximum number of epochs: Training can be stopped after a fixed number of epochs, regardless of the model's performance.
* Early stopping: Training can be stopped when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.

However, without more information, it is impossible to determine which criteria are used in this specific study.
