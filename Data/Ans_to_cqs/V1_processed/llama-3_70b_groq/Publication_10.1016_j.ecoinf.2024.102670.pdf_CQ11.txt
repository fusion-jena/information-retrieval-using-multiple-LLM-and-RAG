I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets from various research papers and articles, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository link. The links mentioned in the context are to specific research articles or papers, but not to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
