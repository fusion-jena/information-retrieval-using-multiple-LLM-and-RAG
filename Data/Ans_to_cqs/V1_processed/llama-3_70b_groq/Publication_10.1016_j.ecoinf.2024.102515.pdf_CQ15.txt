I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The text appears to be discussing a methodology for searching and filtering tweets on Twitter to identify biodiversity observations, and it does not involve deep learning or optimization techniques. The context focuses on the use of the Twitter API, tweet search queries, and data filtering processes to obtain relevant tweets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
