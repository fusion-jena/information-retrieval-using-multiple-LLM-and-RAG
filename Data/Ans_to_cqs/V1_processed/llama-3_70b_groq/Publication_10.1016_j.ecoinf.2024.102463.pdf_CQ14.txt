The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Hyperband algorithm, which is a hyperparameter optimization method based on the "successive halving" strategy. This algorithm combines an initial random search with a "successive halving" strategy to quickly identify promising configurations while eliminating those that show inferior performance. It explores several configurations in parallel while allocating more training resources to promising configurations, enabling a more efficient search of the hyperparameter space, particularly when computational resources are limited.
