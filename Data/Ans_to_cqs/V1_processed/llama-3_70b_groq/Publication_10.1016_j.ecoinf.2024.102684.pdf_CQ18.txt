The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the evaluation metrics used, such as the coefficients of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics are used to assess the model's performance on the training, validation, and test datasets.

Additionally, the context mentions that the overfitting is assessed by comparing the model's performance on the training, validation, and test datasets. This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training by evaluating its performance on the validation dataset and comparing it to its performance on the training dataset. This helps to identify if the model is overfitting or not.

However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model's performance during training, such as early stopping or learning rate scheduling, is not mentioned in the provided context.
