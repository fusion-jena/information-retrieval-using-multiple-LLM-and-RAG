Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the experimental setting, comparative algorithms, and the framework of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss. It describes the training process, including the use of an RTX 2080 Ti GPU, the Adam optimizer, and the presentation of the entire training set in a random order. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used, data preprocessing, or any techniques employed to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
