Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on the analysis of filamentous organisms, specifically the Rhizophagus irregularis fungus, and discusses methods for analyzing filament length and network topology. It does not provide information on machine learning model training or postprocessing steps.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
