The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the workflow that leverages citizen science data to extract relevant records from social media posts, and the use of textual and visual analysis to identify red kite sightings. It also mentions the training of a model using an independent test set of 2060 images, but it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used for these images.

Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
