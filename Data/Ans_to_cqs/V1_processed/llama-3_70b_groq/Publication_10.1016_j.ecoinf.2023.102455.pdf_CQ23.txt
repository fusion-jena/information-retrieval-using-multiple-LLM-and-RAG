Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters of different models, such as CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN, and their performance metrics (R, RMSE, and MAPE) for streamflow forecasting. It also mentions the normalization of input and target parameters between 0 and 1 to prevent cumulative errors and improve convergence. However, it does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
