Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method used in this study is field sampling. Specifically, the field data were collected during the summer season in 2010, and the presence or absence and the cover percentage of the three seagrass species were recorded for each sampling point by means of inspection and sampling of the seabed. This suggests that the researchers physically visited the study site and collected data through direct observation and measurement.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for data collection. It is possible that the researchers may have used other methods, such as remote sensing or aerial photography, to collect additional data, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, the raw data collection method used in this study appears to be field sampling, involving direct observation and measurement of the seabed.
