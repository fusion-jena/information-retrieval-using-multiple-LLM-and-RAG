The context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that image data is used, as the study involves the use of UAV data and SPOT satellite images for land use land cover (LULC) classification. Additionally, the context mentions the use of CATALYST PROFESSIONAL image processing software for UAV data processing. Therefore, it can be assumed that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the specific format of the image data (e.g., JPEG, TIFF, etc.) is not mentioned.
