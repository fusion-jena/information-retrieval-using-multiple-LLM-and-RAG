The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that object extraction and segmentation processes are involved in the pre-processing pipeline. 

In the object extraction step, a binary mask is created to indicate which pixels or voxels in the RGB-D image belong to the object. This suggests that some form of instance segmentation might be involved, where the object of interest is separated from the rest of the scene. 

However, there is no explicit mention of bounding box annotation or other specific data annotation techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that bounding box annotation is used in this particular pipeline.

In summary, while instance segmentation might be involved in the object extraction step, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
