Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameter tuning of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their performance comparison on various datasets. It discusses the search space of CNN hyperparameters, the proposed approach for hyperparameter optimization, and the performance comparison of different CNN models. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

In general, preprocessing steps are crucial in deep learning and may include techniques like data normalization, feature scaling, data augmentation, handling missing values, and data cleaning. These steps can significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model. However, without specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved in this particular case.
