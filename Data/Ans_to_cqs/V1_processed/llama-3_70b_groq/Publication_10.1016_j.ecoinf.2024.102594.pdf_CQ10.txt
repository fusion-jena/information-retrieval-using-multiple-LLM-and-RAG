I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text only describes the implementation details of the DeepLabV3+ algorithm, such as the Python version, PyTorch library, and hyperparameters used, but it does not provide a link to a code repository like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
