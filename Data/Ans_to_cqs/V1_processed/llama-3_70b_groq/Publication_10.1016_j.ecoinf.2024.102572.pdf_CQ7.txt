I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the processing of data in Google Earth Engine (GEE), the calculation of above-ground biomass, and the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments. However, it does not provide information on how the data is split for training, testing, and validation of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
