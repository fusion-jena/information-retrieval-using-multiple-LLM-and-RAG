The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing a Monte Carlo method-based model for predicting real-world phenomena like wildfire spreads or pest plant propagation, and it mentions variance reduction strategies like importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
