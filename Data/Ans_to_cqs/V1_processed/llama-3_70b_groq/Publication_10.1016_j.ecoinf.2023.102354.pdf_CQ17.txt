Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be focused on groundwater-climate interactions, drought, and hydrological studies, with no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
