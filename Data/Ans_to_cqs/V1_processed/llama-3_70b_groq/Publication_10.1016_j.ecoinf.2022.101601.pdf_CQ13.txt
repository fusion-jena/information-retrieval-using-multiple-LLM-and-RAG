I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The context appears to be related to permafrost modeling, discussing input parameters such as thaw depth, soil density, and solar radiation. There is no mention of learning rates, optimizers, or any other hyperparameters typically associated with deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
