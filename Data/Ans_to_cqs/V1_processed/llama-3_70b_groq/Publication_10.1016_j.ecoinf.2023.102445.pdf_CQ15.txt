Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the neural network, including the SPPF module, feature pyramid network (FPN), path aggregation network (PAN), and the reduce detection head. It also explains the operations and calculations performed in these components, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
