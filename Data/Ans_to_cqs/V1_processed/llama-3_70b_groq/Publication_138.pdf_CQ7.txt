Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the ICSNet model, its layers, and the inspiration drawn from other models like GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and LeNet. It also briefly touches on the idea behind the ICSNet model, which is to achieve a tradeoff between accuracy and time consumption. However, it does not provide information on data splitting criteria for model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
