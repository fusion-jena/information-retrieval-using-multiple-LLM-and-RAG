The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the software code was written in Python 3 for audio pre-processing, and spectrograms were generated using the Librosa library. This suggests that some form of audio preprocessing was performed, but the specific steps are not detailed.

It is common in deep learning for audio data to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided information.
