I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a research paper on forestry and ecological informatics, discussing various estimators for calculating diversity indices in forest surveys. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository in the provided context. The text only discusses mathematical equations and their applications in forestry, with no reference to code or software development. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query about the code repository of a deep learning pipeline.
