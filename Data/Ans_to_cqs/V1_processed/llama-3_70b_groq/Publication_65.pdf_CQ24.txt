Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning algorithms for semantic segmentation in urban areas, specifically for tree detection, and discusses the performance of various architectures and their evaluation metrics. It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
