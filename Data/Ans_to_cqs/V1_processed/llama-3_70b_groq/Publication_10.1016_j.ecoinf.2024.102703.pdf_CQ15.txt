The provided context does not mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context only discusses the architecture of the three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network, the training parameters, and the evaluation metrics used. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used, such as SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
