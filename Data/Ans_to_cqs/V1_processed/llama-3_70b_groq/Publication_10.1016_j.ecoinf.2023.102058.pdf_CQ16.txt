Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context discusses various machine learning models, including PCR, PLSR, and RF, and their applications, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria for determining its completion.

The context does mention the use of a grid search to find the best number of trees (ntrees) in a Random Forest model, but it does not provide details on how the training process is monitored or when it is considered complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
