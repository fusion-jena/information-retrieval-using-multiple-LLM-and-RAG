Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text focuses on introducing deep learning for predictive ecology, providing a reproducible example of designing, training, and applying deep neural networks (DNNs) for ecological prediction, and comparing their performance with other classification algorithms.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of the H2O platform, which provides a set of fast and scalable learning algorithms. It is possible that the H2O platform has built-in mechanisms to handle randomness, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results, using techniques such as dropout to reduce overfitting, and employing regularization methods to prevent the model from memorizing the training data. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
