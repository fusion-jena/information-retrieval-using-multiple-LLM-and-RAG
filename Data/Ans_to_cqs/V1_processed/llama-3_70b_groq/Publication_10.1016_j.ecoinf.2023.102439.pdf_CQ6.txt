Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model used for predicting vegetation biomass density. It discusses the input and output layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. These steps help to prepare the data, reduce the effect of outliers, and improve the model's performance.

Since the context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps used in this particular study, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
