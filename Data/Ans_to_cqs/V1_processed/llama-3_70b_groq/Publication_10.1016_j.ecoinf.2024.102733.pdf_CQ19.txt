The provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the MLP, the optimization algorithm, and the loss functions used, but it does not specify the framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to implement the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
