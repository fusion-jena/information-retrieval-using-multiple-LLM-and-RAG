Based on the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through Landsat 8 imagery, which consists of eleven spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for bands 1-7 and 9, 15 meters for band 8, and 100 meters for bands 10 and 11. This data is available on Google Earth Engine Platform. Additionally, fire hotspot data analysis is provided by INPE (http://www.inpe.br/queimadas/bdqueimadas), which is used to determine the optimal period for burn scar mapping.
