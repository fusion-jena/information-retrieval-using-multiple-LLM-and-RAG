I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses the use of random forest classification for mapping coastal and seagrass habitats, but it does not provide information about the availability of the pipeline or the data repository where it can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
