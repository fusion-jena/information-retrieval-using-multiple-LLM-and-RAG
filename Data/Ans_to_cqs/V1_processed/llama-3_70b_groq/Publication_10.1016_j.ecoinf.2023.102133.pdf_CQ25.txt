The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to estimate evapotranspiration (ETa) and save irrigation water. The model is calibrated under regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) conditions to predict ETa. The input features used in the model include soil water content (SWC), weather, and satellite data. The model aims to optimize water usage by predicting ETa accurately, which can help in reducing water waste and conserving this valuable resource.
