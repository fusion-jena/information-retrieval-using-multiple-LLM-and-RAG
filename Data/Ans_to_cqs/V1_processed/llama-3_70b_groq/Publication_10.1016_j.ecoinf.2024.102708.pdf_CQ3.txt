I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, for object detection, but it does not provide information on how the data was annotated for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
