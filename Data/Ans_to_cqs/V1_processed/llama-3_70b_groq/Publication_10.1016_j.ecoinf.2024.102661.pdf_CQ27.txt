I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, the architecture of the LSTM neural network, and the training process, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
