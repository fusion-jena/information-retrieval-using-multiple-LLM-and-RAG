The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of machine learning ensemble predictions using algorithms such as RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS. 

The performance of these machine learning models is evaluated using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves, which are used to assess the model's ability to distinguish between true positives and false positives. The average ROC value across the ensemble is reported to be 71%. 

There is no mention of other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.
