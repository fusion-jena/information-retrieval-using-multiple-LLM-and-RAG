According to the provided context, the evaluation indicators used to assess the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). These metrics are used to evaluate the detection accuracy of the model. Additionally, the model's complexity is gauged by the number of parameters (Params), giga floating-point operations (GFLOPs), number of model network layers (Layers), and frames per second (FPS), whereas the memory footprint (memory) assesses the model's size.
