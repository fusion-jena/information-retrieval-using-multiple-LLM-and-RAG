Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of satellite images, machine learning techniques, and cloud computing for land use and land cover data, forest fire area calculation, and carbon emissions quantification. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, it can be inferred that the context involves working with geospatial data, and some preprocessing steps might be implied, such as rescaling image resolution (as mentioned in the context) or handling missing values. But these are not explicitly stated as preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
