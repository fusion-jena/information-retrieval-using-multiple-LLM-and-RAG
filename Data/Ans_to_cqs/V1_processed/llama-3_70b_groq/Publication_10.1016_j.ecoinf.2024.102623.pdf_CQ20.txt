I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the architecture of the model, the training hyperparameters, and the performance of different loss functions, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
