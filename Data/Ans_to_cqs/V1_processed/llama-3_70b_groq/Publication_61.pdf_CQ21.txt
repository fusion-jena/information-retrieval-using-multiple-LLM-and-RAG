The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the calculation of the confusion matrix, which is a common postprocessing step in machine learning. Specifically, it mentions the non-normalized confusion matrix (Fig. 11) and the normalized confusion matrix (Fig. 12). 

Additionally, the context does not mention saliency maps, which are a type of visualization technique used to understand the model's predictions. It also does not explicitly mention the calculation of other metrics, although it does mention the accuracy of the model on the train and validation sets.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is the calculation of the confusion matrix. Other postprocessing steps may have been performed, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
