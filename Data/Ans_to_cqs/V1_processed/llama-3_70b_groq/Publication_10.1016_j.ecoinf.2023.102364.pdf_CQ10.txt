I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text mentions "open source code" in the context of research practices, but it does not provide a specific link to a repository. Additionally, the text describes the use of machine learning models such as RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
