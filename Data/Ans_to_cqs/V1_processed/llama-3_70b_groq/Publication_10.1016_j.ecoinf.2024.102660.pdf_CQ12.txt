The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a variant of the UNet architecture. This is evident from the text, which mentions the "UNet convolutional neural network" and the "Res_AUNet network", which is a modified version of the UNet architecture. The Res_AUNet network is constructed using the PyTorch library and is used for water sun glint detection in UAV water images.
