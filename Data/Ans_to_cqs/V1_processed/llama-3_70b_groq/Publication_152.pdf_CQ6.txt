Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically U-Net, for image classification tasks, particularly for identifying invasive vegetation species. It discusses data gathering, training, and testing, but does not delve into the preprocessing steps.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the context mentions "pre-processing" as a stage in the methodology (Section II). But the specific steps involved in this stage are not elaborated upon.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, data augmentation, and feature extraction. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case, and further information would be required to provide a more accurate answer.
