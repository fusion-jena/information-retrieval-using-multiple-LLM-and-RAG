The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. The context mentions the use of machine-learning models such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as part of an ensemble modeling approach to predict the distribution of the study species. However, it does not specify the purpose of these models, such as classification, segmentation, or detection.
