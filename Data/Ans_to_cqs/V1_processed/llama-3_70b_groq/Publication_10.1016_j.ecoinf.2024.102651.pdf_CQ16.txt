I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text discusses the performance of the proposed classification network on a dataset, comparing its accuracy with other models such as ResNet50 and ViT. It also mentions the improvement in accuracy achieved by incorporating CAM (Class Activation Mapping) into the network. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
