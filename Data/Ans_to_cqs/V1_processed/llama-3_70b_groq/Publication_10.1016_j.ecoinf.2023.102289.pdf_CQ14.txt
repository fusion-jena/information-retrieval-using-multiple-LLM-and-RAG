I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the loading of pre-trained models, setting thresholds, output formats, and computational efficiency, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
