The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. This is evident from the context, which mentions that the audio data is converted to a monophonic channel and resampled at 16 kHz, and then the spectrogram is extracted and created using STFT magnitudes of 25 ms overlapped by 15 ms. Additionally, the Mel spectrogram is calculated by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz. These steps are typical preprocessing techniques used for audio data in deep learning pipelines.
