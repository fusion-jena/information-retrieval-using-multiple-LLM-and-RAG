The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to construct an unbiased validation set comprising 20% of the current dataset's images. This validation set is carefully designed to maintain a similar distribution of species and to ensure independence by keeping images from the same transect grouped together. This approach avoids any performance bias related to the natural imbalance of species and any spatial bias related to the overlap of images. The model's performance is evaluated on this validation set at each training stage, and the model relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set is selected to avoid any risk of overfitting.
