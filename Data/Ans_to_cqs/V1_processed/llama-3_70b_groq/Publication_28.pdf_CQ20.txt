Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. The context primarily focuses on the various deep learning approaches and architectures used for satellite image classification, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources utilized for training these models.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of Apache Spark for accelerating deep learning inference for large-scale satellite image analytics in one of the references (Lunga et al., 2020). This suggests that distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark might be used for scaling up the processing of large satellite image datasets, but it does not provide direct information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models.

In summary, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to determine the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models.
