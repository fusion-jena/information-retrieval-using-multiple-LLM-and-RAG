I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the use of Google Cloud computing and Google Earth Engine, but it does not provide a link to a repository where the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
