The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the FCOVER retrieval algorithm, its implementation in Google Earth Engine, and the use of Sentinel-2 data. It discusses the importance of atmospherically corrected data, the use of harmonized S2 post-fire Level-2 A data, and the implementation of RF regression in FIREMAP. 

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
