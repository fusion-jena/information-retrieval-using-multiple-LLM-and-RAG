Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction and analysis, but it does not specify the purpose of a deep learning model. 

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might be used for image reconstruction or prediction, as it mentions "Applying deep-learning enhanced fusion methods for improved NDVI reconstruction" in one of the references. Additionally, the context discusses evaluation metrics for assessing the accuracy of predicted images, which suggests that the deep learning model might be used for image prediction or reconstruction tasks. 

But without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
