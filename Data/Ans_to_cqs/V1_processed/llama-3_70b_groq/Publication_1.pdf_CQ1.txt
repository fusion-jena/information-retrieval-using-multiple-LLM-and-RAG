Based on the provided context, it appears that sensors are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions "regional sensor networks" and "cheap and powerful sensors" that generate a large volume of data. It also provides specific examples of sensor data, such as audio streams for recording bird vocalizations and image streams for tracking populations of invasive snakes. These sensors are deployed at monitoring sites, and the data is collected and transmitted back to a central data store for further analysis.

There is no mention of surveys or public datasets being used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context suggests that the focus is on leveraging advances in big data and deep learning to process and analyze the large amounts of data generated by these sensors.
