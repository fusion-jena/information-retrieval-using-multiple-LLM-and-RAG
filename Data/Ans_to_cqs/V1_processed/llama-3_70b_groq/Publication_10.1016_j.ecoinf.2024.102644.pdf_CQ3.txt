I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to discuss the use of big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models to predict biodiversity changes and trends in wetland ecosystems, particularly in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. It mentions the use of species observation data from a public authoritative repository (GBIF) improved with reliable records directly observed in the field, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
