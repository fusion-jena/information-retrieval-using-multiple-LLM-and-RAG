Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses audio data formats. In Figure 8, it is mentioned that the acquired audio files are transmitted over 4G using SMTP and then segmented into 15-second windows for feature extraction using MFCC. This suggests that the input data to the pipeline is in an audio format. There is no mention of image, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it is worth noting that Figure 12 mentions the use of visual data for bird classification, suggesting that image data may be used in a separate pipeline or approach.
