Based on the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. The experiment mentioned in the text uses three tagging methods, one with ML bounding box assistance and two without assistance, to label data. The results show that ML bounding box-assisted tagging can offer an efficient method for labeling, but its effectiveness depends on the ML algorithm's performance. There is no mention of instance segmentation or other data annotation techniques in the provided context.
