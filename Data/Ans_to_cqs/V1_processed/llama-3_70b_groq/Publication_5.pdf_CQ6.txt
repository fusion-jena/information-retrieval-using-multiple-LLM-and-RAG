Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the training process, model comparison, and performance evaluation, but it does not provide information about the preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature engineering, and data augmentation, among others. Normalization and scaling are often used to ensure that the input features have similar scales, which can improve the model's performance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming the most relevant features for the model.

Since the context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps, it is impossible to determine the exact steps involved in this particular case.
