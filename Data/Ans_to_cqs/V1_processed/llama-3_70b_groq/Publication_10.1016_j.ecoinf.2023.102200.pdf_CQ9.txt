I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and articles related to remote sensing, LiDAR data, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
