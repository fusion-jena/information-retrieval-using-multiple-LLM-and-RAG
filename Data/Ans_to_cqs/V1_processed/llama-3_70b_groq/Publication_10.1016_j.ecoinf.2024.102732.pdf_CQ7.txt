I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to machine learning and remote sensing applications, but it does not provide specific information on data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. The context discusses various machine learning algorithms, such as SVR, MLR, RF, and XGBoost, and their applications in predicting forest biomass and other environmental variables, but it does not address the specific query. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
