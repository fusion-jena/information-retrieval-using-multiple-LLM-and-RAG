I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning model training or the criteria used to split data for training, testing, and validation. The context primarily discusses the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, data mining, and the Apriori algorithm, but it does not provide information on deep learning model training or data splitting criteria.
