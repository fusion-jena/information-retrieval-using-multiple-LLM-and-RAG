I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The "Data availability" section only mentions the funding sources for the projects, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
