The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors used various performance metrics to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 

The authors also performed hyperparameter tuning for the linear regression model, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and ridge regression model. They explored different values of Î± (L2 regularization) and C (penalty parameter) to identify the optimal hyperparameters that result in the best model performance.

Additionally, the authors compared the performance of different models, including CLIP models and fine-tuned models, on the plaice test set. They reported the accuracy and RMSE of each model, which suggests that they monitored the model performance during training using these metrics.

However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training, such as early stopping or learning rate scheduling, is not mentioned in the provided context.
