The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image processing and feature extraction in herbarium sheets. It discusses the use of transfer learning to reduce training time and improve model performance, but it does not address data bias or preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not discussed in the given context.
