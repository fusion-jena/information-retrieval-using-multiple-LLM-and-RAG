The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected from various sources such as satellite images, underwater digital images, and possibly surveys or field observations.

For instance, Perez et al. (2020) used 'WorldView-2' satellite images to map seagrass distribution, while Moniruzzaman et al. (2019) used underwater digital images for seagrass detection. Additionally, Martin-Abadal et al. (2018) used an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to collect data for online Posidonia oceanica meadows identification.

It is also possible that public datasets are used, as mentioned in the context, such as the 'LookingForSeagrass' dataset used by Weidmann et al. (2019).

However, the context does not provide explicit information on the use of sensors or surveys for collecting raw data. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these methods are utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
