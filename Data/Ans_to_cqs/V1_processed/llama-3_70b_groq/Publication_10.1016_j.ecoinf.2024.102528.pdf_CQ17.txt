Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models in bird species monitoring and image recognition, but it does not delve into the specific techniques used to prevent overfitting.

However, it is worth noting that the paper by He et al. (2016) on deep residual learning for image recognition might have employed certain regularization methods, but the context does not provide enough information to determine which specific methods were used.

In general, common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include dropout, L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation, among others. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine which methods were used in the context of the provided papers.
