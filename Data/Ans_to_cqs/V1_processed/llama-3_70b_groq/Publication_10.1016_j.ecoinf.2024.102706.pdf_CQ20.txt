The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only discusses the machine learning models used, such as Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, and their hyperparameters, but does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
