Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bootstrap Forest, Boosted Tree, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for predicting different variables like bark thickness, hypericin content, and pest occurrence. It also mentions the use of different techniques like genetic algorithm and extreme learning machine (ELM) for prediction. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of these models are optimized. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
