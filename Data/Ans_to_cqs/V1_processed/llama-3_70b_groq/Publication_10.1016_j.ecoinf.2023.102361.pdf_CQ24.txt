Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the dataset splitting, deep learning models, and their performance on the weed detection task. It discusses the issues with the dataset, such as inter-class similarity and intra-class dissimilarity, and how they affect the model's performance, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
