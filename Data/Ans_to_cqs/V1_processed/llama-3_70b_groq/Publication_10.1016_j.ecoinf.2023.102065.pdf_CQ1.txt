The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various methods are used depending on the specific application and domain.

In the context of birdsong recognition, it is mentioned that "crowdsource" data collection platforms like Zooniverse (Cox et al., 2015) are used. Additionally, the Arbimon pattern-matching routine is mentioned, which involves using templates and volunteers with expertise to acquire species present ROI data.

In the context of ecoacoustic data, it is mentioned that cloud-based crowd-sourcing platforms could be used to scale up the reference data collection step.

It can be inferred that surveys, sensors, and public datasets might be used in certain applications, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. For example, the paper by Quinn et al. (2022) uses ecoacoustic data, but it does not specify how the data was collected.

In general, the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines can vary widely depending on the specific application and domain. Further research is needed to determine the most effective methods for collecting high-quality data in different contexts.
