Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on data filtering, acquisition, and processing of Earth Observation (EO) data using Google Earth Engine (GEE). It discusses the application of masks, filtering by date, and clipping to a specific study area extent, as well as the challenges of processing large amounts of EO data. However, it does not touch on data annotation techniques, which are typically used in deep learning pipelines for tasks such as object detection and image segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
