Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It discusses the development of the model using TensorFlow, hyperparameter tuning, and the comparison of its performance with a random forest model. However, it does not provide information on how the dataset was split, whether cross-validation was used, or if any other techniques were employed to ensure the model's generalizability.

The context does mention that a small subset of the data was used for iterative grid search parameter tuning, but it does not provide further details on how the data was split or used for model evaluation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based on the provided context.
