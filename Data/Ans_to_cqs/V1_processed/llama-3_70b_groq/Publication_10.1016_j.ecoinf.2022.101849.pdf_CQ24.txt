The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on predicting potential natural vegetation (PNV) using machine learning methods, including neural networks, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. It also touches on handling incomplete data through partial imputation algorithms and comparing the mean absolute error (MAE) of different approaches.

However, it does mention random reduction and non-random (biased) reduction methods for artificially introducing incompleteness into the data. These methods involve reducing targets by a random percentage or fraction, but they are not directly related to handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context.
