Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of generating training data for fine-tuning deep noise reduction techniques in bioacoustics applications and the limitations of applying deep learning-based denoising methods to these applications. It does mention that collecting clean recordings is infeasible in many cases or requires the recording of captive animals, which may not be representative of the wider population. However, it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
