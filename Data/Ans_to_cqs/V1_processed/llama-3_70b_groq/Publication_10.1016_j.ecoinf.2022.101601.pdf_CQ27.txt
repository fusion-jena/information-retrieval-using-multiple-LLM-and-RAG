I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, model serialization, or platform selection. The context appears to be related to research papers on topics such as permafrost, soil moisture, and Bayesian networks, but it does not provide information on deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
