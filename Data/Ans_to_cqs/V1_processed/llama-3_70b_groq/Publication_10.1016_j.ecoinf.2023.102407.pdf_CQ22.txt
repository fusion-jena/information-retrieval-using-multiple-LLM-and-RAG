The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the Species Distribution Models (SDMs) in this study are sensitivity, specificity, the true skill statistic (TSS), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). These metrics are calculated using a confusion matrix to quantitatively assess the SDMs.
