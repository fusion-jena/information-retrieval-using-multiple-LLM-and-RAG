The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the Random Forest (RF) model, not deep learning models. It mentions that the training samples were randomly divided according to proportions of 80% and 20% and used for the training and test datasets, respectively. However, this is specific to the RF model and not deep learning models. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
