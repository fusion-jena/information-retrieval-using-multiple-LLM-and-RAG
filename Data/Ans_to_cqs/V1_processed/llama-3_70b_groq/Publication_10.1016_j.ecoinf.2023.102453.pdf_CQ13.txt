The context mentions that the common hyperparameters for a Deep Neural Network (DNN) are learning rate, batch size, and dropout. Additionally, it is mentioned that the learning rate was optimized using Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization techniques. However, it does not provide information about the optimizer used in the deep learning model.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the hyperparameter used in the deep learning model mentioned in the context is the learning rate. The context does not provide information about the optimizer used.
