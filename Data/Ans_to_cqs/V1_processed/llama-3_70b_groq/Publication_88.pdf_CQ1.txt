The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the EF network, the number of samples in the training, validation, and test sets for the Amazon and Cerrado databases, and the performance metrics used for evaluation. It also discusses the influence of the number of training samples and the procedure for training SVMs filter banks.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected from remote sensing images or satellite imagery, as the context mentions "tiles" and "patches" which are common terms used in remote sensing and computer vision. Additionally, the context mentions "deforestation" and "no-deforestation" classes, which suggests that the raw data might be related to land cover classification or change detection.

But, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
