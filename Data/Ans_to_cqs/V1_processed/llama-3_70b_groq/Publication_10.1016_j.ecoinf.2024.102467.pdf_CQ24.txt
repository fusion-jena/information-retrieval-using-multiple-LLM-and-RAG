I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or random seed values. The context appears to be a collection of references and author contributions related to various topics such as ecology, computer vision, and neural networks, but it does not provide information on strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
