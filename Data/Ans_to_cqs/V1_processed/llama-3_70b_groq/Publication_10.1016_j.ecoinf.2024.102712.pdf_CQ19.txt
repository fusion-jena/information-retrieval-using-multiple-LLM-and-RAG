The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses the use of Sentinel-2 data in modelling frameworks, but it does not specify the frameworks used to build deep learning models. It mentions model-assisted frameworks (e.g., St√•hl et al., 2016) and hierarchical modelling (e.g., Saarela et al., 2016, 2018), but these are not deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
