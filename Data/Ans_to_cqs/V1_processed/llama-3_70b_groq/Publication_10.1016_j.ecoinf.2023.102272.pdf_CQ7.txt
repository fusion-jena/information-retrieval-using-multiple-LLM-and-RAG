The data is split into five partitions: At (25% for training candidate models), Av (50% for validating candidate models), Bt (75% = At + Av for training the selected candidate model), Bv (25% for validation to determine the optimal number of epochs to train the selected candidate model), and T (for model testing, using data from each year separately).
