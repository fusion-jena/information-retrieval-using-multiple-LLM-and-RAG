I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to focus on transfer learning, active learning, and the use of pre-trained models like BirdNet, VGGish, and YamNet for audio classification tasks. It discusses the evaluation of these models on different datasets and the application of active learning strategies for sample selection. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in the pipeline.
