The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the dataset was split into training and validation sets, with 70% of the data used for training and the remaining 30% for validation. This suggests that some form of data splitting was used, but the specifics are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the training set was enhanced through various methods, including flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels, randomly rotating the images and labels, and randomly adding noise to the images. This suggests that data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the training data, which can help improve the generalizability of the model.

However, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures were taken to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.
