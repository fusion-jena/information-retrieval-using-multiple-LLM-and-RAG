I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. It discusses the cblindplot package, R packages for mapping scientifically sound response variables, and various research papers on topics such as colour blindness, ecological informatics, and visualization. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
