Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically LSTM, for forecasting ecological water demand in an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario. It explains the structure and functionality of the LSTM model, but it does not discuss regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
