I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, being applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing a study on the relationship between forest microclimate and NAI (Net Annual Increment), and it mentions the use of big data theory and technology, neural networks, and structural equations for data mining and modeling. However, it does not provide any information on data augmentation techniques.
