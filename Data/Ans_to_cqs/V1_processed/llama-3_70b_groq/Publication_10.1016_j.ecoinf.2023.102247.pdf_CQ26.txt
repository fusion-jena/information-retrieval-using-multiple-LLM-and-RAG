The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or techniques to address data bias during preprocessing. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling using ensemble modeling approaches in R, specifically using BIOMOD2 package. It discusses the use of cross-validation, regression-based models, and machine-learning models such as MaxEnt, RF, and SVM to generate a final ensembled model for each species.

There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or techniques to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
