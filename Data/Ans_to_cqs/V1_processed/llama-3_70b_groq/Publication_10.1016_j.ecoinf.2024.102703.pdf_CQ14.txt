The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the LASSO model are optimized. It only mentions that the LASSO model is used for variable selection and statistical regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model. It does not provide information on the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
