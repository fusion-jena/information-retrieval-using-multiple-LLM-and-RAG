Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the methodology and architecture used for the auto-encoder-based feature extraction for ecoacoustic analysis. It discusses the dataset, network architecture, and training process, but does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
