I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on evaluating the performance of different models (statistical and machine learning) for predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps, but it does not provide information on how the trained models were deployed.
