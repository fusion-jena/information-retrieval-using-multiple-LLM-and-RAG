I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or a pipeline that uses one. The context appears to be related to forest biomass estimation, carbon storage, and remote sensing, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model being used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
