The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and application of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, specifically the PTDLEN-VAE model, for satellite imagery analysis in ecology management. It discusses the model's structure, training process, and performance evaluation.

However, it is common in deep learning pipelines to use regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent the model from relying too heavily on specific neurons, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights.

Since the context does not provide specific information about the regularization methods used in the PTDLEN-VAE model, I cannot confirm whether these techniques are used or not.
