Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the comparison of different CNN architectures (FCN, U-Net, SegNet, DeepLabV3+, and DDCN) in terms of their performance, number of parameters, and computational complexity. It also presents some visual analysis of feature maps learned by the convolutional layers and discusses the convergence of the evaluated networks (Figure 11). However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
