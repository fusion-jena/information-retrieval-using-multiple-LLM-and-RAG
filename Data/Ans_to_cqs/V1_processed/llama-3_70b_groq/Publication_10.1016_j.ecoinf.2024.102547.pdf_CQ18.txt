Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for both training and testing datasets. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of regression models, and their values are provided in the context for different models.

The context shows that the RMSE and MAE values are reported for both training and testing datasets, which suggests that the model performance is being monitored during training using these metrics. The values of these metrics can be used to identify overfitting or underfitting of the model and to adjust the model hyperparameters accordingly.

However, it is not clear from the context what specific strategy is being used to adjust the model hyperparameters based on the evaluation metrics. It is also not clear if any other evaluation metrics or techniques, such as cross-validation, are being used to monitor the model performance.
