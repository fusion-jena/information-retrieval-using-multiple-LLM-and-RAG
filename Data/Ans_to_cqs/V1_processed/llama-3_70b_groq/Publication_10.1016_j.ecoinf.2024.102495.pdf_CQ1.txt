Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the feature extraction process, deep learning model parameters, and performance metrics. It discusses the use of voice recordings and the generation of spectrograms as a visual representation of sound data, but it does not provide information on how the raw voice recordings were collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
