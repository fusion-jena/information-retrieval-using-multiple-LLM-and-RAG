The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using the training set and test set, which are split from the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image in a 1:9 ratio. The training samples are used to learn the weights and biases of the network, and the test samples are used to evaluate the classification performance. 

The performance metrics used to evaluate the model are average accuracy (AA), overall accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient (K). These metrics are used to quantify the classification performance of the SSPCNN model and compare it with other methods such as SVM, 1-D-CNN, and 2-D-CNN. However, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not mentioned.
