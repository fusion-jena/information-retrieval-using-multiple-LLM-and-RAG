The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses the evaluation of machine learning models using four criteria: coefficient of determination (R2), NSE (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) (Gupta et al., 2009), and correlation coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024). It also presents the performance statistics of different models (Frequency Ratio, Statistical Index, Random Forest, and Classification and Regression Trees) on training and testing datasets. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.
