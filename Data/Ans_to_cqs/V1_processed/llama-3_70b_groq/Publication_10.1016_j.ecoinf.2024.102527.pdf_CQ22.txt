Based on the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy. The context mentions "the accuracy of the transfer learning model was always better than that of the model trained from scratch" and provides accuracy values for different transfer strategies and sample sizes. However, it does not mention other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context.
