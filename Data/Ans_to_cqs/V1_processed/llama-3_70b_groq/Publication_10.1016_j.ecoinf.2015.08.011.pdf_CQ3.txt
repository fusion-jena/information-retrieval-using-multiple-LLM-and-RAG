I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their application in ecology, environmental engineering, and bioinformatics, but it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
