Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the application of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and deep learning methods, specifically SLSTM and SGRU, for time-series prediction. It discusses the hyperparameters of SVR, such as C and Îµ, but does not provide information on optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
