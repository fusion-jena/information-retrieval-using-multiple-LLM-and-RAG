I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the architectures of the models, their accuracy on different datasets, and the use of pre-trained models with the ImageNet dataset. It also mentions the Adam optimization method in a reference to a paper by Kingma and Ba (2014), but it does not specify that this optimizer was used in the current study. Therefore, I cannot determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model from the provided context.
