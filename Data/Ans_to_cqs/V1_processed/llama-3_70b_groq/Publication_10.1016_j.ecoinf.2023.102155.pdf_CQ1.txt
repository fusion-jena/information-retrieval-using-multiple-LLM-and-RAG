I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a research paper in Ecological Informatics, and it presents various tables and figures comparing the performance of different methods (indiv, knn, kmeans, random, CF, LoopA, LoopT, LoopE) with and without bias correction and lasso regularization. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected in the deep learning pipeline. The context does not mention surveys, sensors, public datasets, or any other data collection methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
