Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for model training (e.g., train, test, validation) is not explicitly mentioned in the context of deep learning. However, it is mentioned that the dataset was randomly divided into two subsets, with 75% of the data devoted to model training and 25% to testing. This suggests that the data was split randomly into training and testing sets, but the context does not provide specific criteria for splitting the data. Additionally, there is no mention of a validation set in the provided context.
