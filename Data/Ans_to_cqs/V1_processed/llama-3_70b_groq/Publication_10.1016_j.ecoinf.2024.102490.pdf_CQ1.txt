Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on species distribution modeling, climatic suitability, and georeferenced data, but it does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data.

However, it can be inferred that the data used in the study might be related to species occurrence records, climatic variables, and georeferenced coordinates. The context mentions the use of QGIS for cropping bioclimatic layers, which suggests that the data might be collected from geographic information systems (GIS) or remote sensing sources.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this query.
