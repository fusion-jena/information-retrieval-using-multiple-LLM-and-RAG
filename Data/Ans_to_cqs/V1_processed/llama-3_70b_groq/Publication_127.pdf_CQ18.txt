The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses the training of different deep neural network (DNN) models on a dataset of camera trap images, the formation of an ensemble of models, and the evaluation of their performance on a test set. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
