Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the pipeline is image data, specifically RGB images. This is evident from the mention of RGB channels, HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) and YUV (Y, Cb, Cr) colour spaces, and the use of a Raspberry Pi camera to capture images. Additionally, the text mentions the extraction of digital numbers (DN) representing the RGB channels, which further supports the idea that image data is being used.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is also not explicitly mentioned, but it is possible that the extracted indices and parameters may be stored in a CSV file for further analysis. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, the data format used in the pipeline appears to be image data, specifically RGB images.
