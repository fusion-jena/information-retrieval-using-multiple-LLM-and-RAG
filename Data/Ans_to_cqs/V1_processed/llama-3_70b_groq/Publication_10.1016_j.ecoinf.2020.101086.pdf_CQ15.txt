I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, optimization techniques, SGD, or Adam. The text appears to be discussing species distribution modeling, correction methods, and evaluation indexes, which are unrelated to deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
