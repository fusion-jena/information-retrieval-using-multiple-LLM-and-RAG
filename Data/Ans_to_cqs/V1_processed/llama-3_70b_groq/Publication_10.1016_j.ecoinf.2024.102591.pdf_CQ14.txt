The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were preserved, except for the number of trees, which was set to 500 to improve computational efficiency without losing precision in the BA estimates. It does not provide information on whether grid search, random search, or any other method was used to optimize the hyperparameters.
