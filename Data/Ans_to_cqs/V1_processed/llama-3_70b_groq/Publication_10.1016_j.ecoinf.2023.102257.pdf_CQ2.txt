The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of images and camera traps, it can be inferred that image data is likely used in the pipeline. There is no mention of audio or video data, and CSV is not mentioned either. Therefore, it can be concluded that image data is used, but the exact format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) is not specified.
