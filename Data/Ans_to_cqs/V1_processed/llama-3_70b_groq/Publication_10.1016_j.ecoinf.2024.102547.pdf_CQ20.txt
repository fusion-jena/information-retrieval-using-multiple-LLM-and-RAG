I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and discusses topics such as principal component analysis (PCA), functional data analysis, and environmental data, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
