Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only mentions that the authors adjusted two parameters from their default values: validation percentage and number of training steps. It does not provide information about other hyperparameters that are typically used in deep learning models, such as learning rate, batch size, or optimizer. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
