I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be a collection of references and abstracts from various papers and studies in the fields of signal processing, machine learning, and water resources. While some of the references mention specific models or techniques, such as neural networks, support vector machines, and genetic programming, they do not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
