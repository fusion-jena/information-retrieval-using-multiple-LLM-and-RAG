The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on bird species detection using audio recordings and machine learning approaches, particularly with the BirdNET project. The datasets mentioned are related to bird species recordings, such as the Xeno-canto database and the Macaulay library of sounds. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
