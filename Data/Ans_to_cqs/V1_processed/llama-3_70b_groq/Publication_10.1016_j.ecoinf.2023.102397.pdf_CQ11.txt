I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to acoustic monitoring and species identification, but it does not provide information about a data repository link. The mentioned references are academic papers and online platforms (e.g., Arbimon, Rainforest Connection website), but none of them seem to be a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline.
