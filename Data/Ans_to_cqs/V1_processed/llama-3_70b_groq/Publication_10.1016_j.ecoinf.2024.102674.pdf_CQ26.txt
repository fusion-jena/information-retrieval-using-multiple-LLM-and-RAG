The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on downscaling climate data, comparing different methods, and evaluating their performance. It discusses the use of random forests, generalized boosted models, and generalized additive models for downscaling, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the context.
