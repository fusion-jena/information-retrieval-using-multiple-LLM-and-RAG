The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is Species Distribution Modelling (SDM). Specifically, the model is used to predict the count of species (i.e., the parameter of the Poisson distribution of the random response variable yi) conditionally on its corresponding input x, with the formula λm,θ (x) = exp(γ T i aNh,m (x, θ )). This suggests that the model is used for regression or prediction tasks, rather than classification, segmentation, or detection.
