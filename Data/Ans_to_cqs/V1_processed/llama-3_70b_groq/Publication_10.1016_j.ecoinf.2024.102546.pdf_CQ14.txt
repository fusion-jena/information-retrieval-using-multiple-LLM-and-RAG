The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The table (Table 2) lists the primary hyperparameter settings of the three detection models (YOLOX, YOLOv8, and VFL), but it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were optimized. It is possible that the authors used a specific method such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
