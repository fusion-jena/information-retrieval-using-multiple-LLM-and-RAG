Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the AutoML procedure, which involves generating candidate models with random architectures and hyperparameters, training them on a small subset of data, and selecting the best-performing model. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
