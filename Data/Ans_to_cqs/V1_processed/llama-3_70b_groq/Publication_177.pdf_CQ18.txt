The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored by minimizing the loss on the validation dataset to perform objective function evaluations. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated on the validation dataset during training, and the loss was minimized to optimize the model's performance.
