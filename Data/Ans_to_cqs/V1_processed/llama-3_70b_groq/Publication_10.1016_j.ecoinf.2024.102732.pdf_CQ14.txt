According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search methodology. This is mentioned in the section 2.8 "Optimizing model parameters" where it is stated that "Optimal values for these parameters were identified using grid search" for both RF and XGBoost models. Additionally, it is mentioned that a grid search methodology was employed to find the best parameter combination, enhancing the model's performance. There is no mention of random search being used for hyperparameter optimization.
