The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the evaluation of the ResNet50 model on three test datasets, the comparison of its performance with the PlantNet tool, and the potential applications of the model in large-scale biodiversity projects. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau or other convergence criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
