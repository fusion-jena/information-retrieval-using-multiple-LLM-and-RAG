The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. It discusses the model training and validation process, hyperparameter tuning using Hyperband and Bayesian optimization, and the importance of optimizing model hyperparameters. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

The context does mention the use of learning and loss curves to diagnose the learning performance of the models over time, which can be considered as a part of model evaluation. But it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
