I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text only discusses the methodology and results of the classification techniques used for bird species classification from flight calls, but it does not provide information about where the data or pipeline is stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
