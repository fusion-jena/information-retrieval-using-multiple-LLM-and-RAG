Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline is processing 3D point cloud data. The input data is represented as a point cloud, which is then partitioned into superpoints and fed into a network for superpoint embedding and segmentation. The context does not explicitly mention the use of image, audio, video, or CSV data formats.

However, it is mentioned that some point cloud processing applications convert 3D point clouds into 2D images and process them using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This suggests that image data formats may be used as an intermediate representation in some point cloud processing pipelines. Nevertheless, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is 3D point cloud data.
