I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. It discusses the methodology and hyperparameter search used in the research, but it does not provide any links or references to a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
