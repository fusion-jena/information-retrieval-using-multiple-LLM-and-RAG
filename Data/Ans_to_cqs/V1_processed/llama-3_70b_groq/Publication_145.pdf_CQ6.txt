Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, loss function, optimizer, and training parameters, as well as the application of deep learning in remote sensing and forest cover classification. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular case, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
