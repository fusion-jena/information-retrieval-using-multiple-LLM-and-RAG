I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or a pipeline that uses one. The text appears to be discussing species distribution models, sampling bias, and environmental covariates, but it does not mention specific deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
