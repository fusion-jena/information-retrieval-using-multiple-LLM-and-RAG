Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for plant organ detection and annotation in digitized herbarium scans.

However, it is a common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout. By setting a random seed value, researchers can ensure that the same sequence of random numbers is generated, which helps in reproducing the results.

In the provided context, there is no mention of setting a random seed value or any other strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is unclear what strategy was employed in this specific study.
