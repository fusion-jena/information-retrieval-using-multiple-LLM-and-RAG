The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the model training process, hyper-parameters, and transfer learning strategies, but it does not discuss regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
