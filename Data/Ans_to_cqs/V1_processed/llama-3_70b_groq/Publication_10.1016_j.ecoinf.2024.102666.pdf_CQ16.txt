I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training, validation loss, or plateau. The text appears to be discussing a study on atmospheric correction algorithms for remote sensing of plateau lakes, and it provides information on the study area, data, and evaluation metrics for the algorithms. There is no mention of machine learning or training processes, which are typically associated with the concept of validation loss plateau. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
