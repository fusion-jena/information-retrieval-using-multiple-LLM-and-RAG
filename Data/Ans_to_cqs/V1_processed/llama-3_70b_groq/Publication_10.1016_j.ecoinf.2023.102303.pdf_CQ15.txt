Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the EfficientNet-B7 model, its architecture, and its application to underwater fish video processing in turbid waters. It also briefly discusses Vision Transformer (ViT) and semi-supervised contrastive learning. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
