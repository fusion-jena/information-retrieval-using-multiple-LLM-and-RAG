The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be discussing a different type of modeling approach, possibly related to species distribution modeling or ecological modeling, where the focus is on selecting and subsampling background points to train models.

The text mentions subsampling background points to create three datasets with different numbers of background points (1×, 10×, and 10K) relative to the number of presences, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques typically used in deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
