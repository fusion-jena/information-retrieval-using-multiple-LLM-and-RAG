I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or strategies to handle randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be discussing a project that involves searching for tweets related to biodiversity observations, using the Twitter API, and handling the resulting data in JSON format. It does not provide any information about deep learning or randomness in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
