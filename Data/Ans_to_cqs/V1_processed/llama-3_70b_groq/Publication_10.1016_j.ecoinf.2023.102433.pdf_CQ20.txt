Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in Google Earth Engine (GEE). It only mentions that GEE uses Tensorflow, a machine learning and artificial intelligence open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team, for deep learning analysis. However, it does not provide information about the underlying hardware resources used for training the model.

In general, Google is known to use Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for accelerating machine learning computations, including deep learning model training. However, this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.
