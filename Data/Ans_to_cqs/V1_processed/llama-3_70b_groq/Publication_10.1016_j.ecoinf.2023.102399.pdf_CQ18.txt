I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a research paper on a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural networks, and it provides various tables and figures showing the results of the model evaluation. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
