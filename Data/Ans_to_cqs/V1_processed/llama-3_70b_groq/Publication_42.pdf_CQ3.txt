Based on the provided context, it appears that manual annotations of the moths were used in the dataset for training the CNN model. Specifically, it is mentioned that "The CNN algorithm was trained on a dataset using manual annotations of the moths." Additionally, it is mentioned that there is a difference in the sizes of the annotations and the bounding boxes placed by the blob segmentation, suggesting that the manual annotations may not have been exactly the same as the bounding boxes used in the pipeline.

However, it is not explicitly stated what specific data annotation techniques were used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the provided context.

It is worth noting that the context does mention blob segmentation, which is a technique used to identify and isolate objects of interest in an image. However, it is not clear if this is related to the annotation technique used in the dataset.
