According to the provided context, the dataset is initially divided into separate subsets based on the number of deer in each image. Within each subset, the images are further partitioned into three sections using a ratio of 75:15:15. This suggests that the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are:

1. Stratification by the number of deer instances in each image, and
2. Random partitioning within each stratum using a ratio of 75:15:15 for training, validation, and testing subsets, respectively.

This approach is used to address the issue of unbalanced distribution of deer numbers across the images in the dataset.
