The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the use of random forest as a baseline model and mentions the calculation of training scores and validation scores using a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) approach with a specific fold pattern of spatial-CV feature selection. However, it does not provide information on how the data is split for deep learning model training.

In fact, the context does not mention deep learning models at all. It discusses traditional machine learning models such as random forest, Bayesian logistic regression, and Bayesian GAM. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
