Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the implementation of the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach, the setting of prior probabilities, and the calculation of posterior model probabilities and Bayes factors. It also mentions the extraction of MCMC diagnostics, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
