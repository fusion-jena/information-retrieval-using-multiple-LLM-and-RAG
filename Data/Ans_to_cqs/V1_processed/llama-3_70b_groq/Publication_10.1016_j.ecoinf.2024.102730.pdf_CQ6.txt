Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning techniques, specifically multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), for vegetation studies and the evaluation of their performance using various metrics. It also discusses the use of SHAP values to understand the importance of features in predicting vegetation phenology characteristics.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. These steps help to prepare the data for training, improve the model's performance, and prevent issues like feature dominance or outliers.

Since the context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps used in this particular study, I cannot provide a definitive answer. It is possible that the authors performed some preprocessing steps, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.
