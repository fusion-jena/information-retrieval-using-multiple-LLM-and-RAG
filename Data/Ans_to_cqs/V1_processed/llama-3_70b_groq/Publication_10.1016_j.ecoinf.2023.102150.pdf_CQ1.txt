Based on the provided context, it appears that camera traps are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the camera trap developed by Soininen et al. (2015) is mentioned, which consists of a Reconyx camera mounted on the ceiling of a metal box that can be entered by small mammals. This suggests that camera traps are used to collect image data of small mammals in their natural habitats.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors trained a deep neural network using camera trap data, implying that the images collected from the camera traps are used as raw data for training the model.

It is also possible that public datasets may be used for collecting raw data, as the context mentions that several neural networks trained on large image datasets are publicly available. However, it is not clear if these public datasets are used in the specific deep learning pipeline being referred to.

There is no mention of surveys or sensors being used for collecting raw data in the provided context.
