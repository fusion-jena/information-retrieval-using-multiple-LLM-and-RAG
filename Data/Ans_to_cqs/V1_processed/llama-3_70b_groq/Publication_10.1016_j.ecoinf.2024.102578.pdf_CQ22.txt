The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and F1. These metrics are defined in Table 4, which provides the equations and definitions for each metric. Specifically, precision is the proportion of images that a model classified as a specific category C that are actually category C, recall is the proportion of images that are actually a specific category C that the model classified as C, and F1 is the weighted average of precision and recall. The performance of the image quality model on the test data is shown in Table 5, which reports the precision, recall, and F1 scores for each location (Finnmark and Yamal) and image quality (Bad and Good).
