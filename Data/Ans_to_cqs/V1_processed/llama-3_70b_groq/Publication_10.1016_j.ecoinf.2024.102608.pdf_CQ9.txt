I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be an abstract or introduction to a research paper discussing the use of machine learning approaches with Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data for estimating water quality parameters in reservoirs. It cites several references and discusses the advantages of machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
