According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for machine learning model training is a random division of the entire dataset into three sets: a training set (60%), a validation set (20%), and a testing set (20%). This is mentioned in the sentence: "The entire dataset was randomly divided into a training set (60%), a validation set (20%), and a testing set (20%)."

This split is a common practice in machine learning, where the training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to optimize the hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.
