I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the performance of the full model, which combines self-supervised and hand-annotated datasets, and its limitations in segmenting small clusters of trees. It also references various papers and methods related to LiDAR data and tree segmentation, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
