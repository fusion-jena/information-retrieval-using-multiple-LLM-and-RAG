Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the optimization of hyperparameters, the definition of the search space, and the execution of optimization algorithms to find the highest accuracy. It also discusses the factors considered during the optimization process, such as model accuracy, computation time, and costs. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
