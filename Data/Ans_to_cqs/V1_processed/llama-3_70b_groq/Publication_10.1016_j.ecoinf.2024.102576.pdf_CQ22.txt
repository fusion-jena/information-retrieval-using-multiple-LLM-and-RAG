Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text mentions that "the classification accuracy and performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imageries over multiple periods" (Kim et al., 2021b), but it does not provide a comprehensive list of evaluation metrics.

In general, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models for image classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean intersection over union (mIoU), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). However, without explicit mention in the context, it is unclear which specific metrics were used in this particular study.
