The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions that the model was trained using epochs and batch sizes of 10 and 32, respectively, and that the hyperparameters were tuned using a root mean square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer. However, it does not specify how the training process was stopped or what criteria were used to determine when the training was complete.

It is common in deep learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, validation accuracy threshold, or a maximum number of epochs to determine when to stop training. However, these criteria are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this case.
