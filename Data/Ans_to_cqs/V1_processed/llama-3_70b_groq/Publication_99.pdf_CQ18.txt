The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated using validation data, as the number of validation samples is provided in Table 2. Additionally, the loss functions used for training, such as cross-entropy loss, adversarial loss, and L1 loss, might have been used to monitor the model performance during training. But the specific strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance are not mentioned.
