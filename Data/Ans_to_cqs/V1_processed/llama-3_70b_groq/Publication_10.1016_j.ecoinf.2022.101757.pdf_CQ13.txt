I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters. The context focuses on the dataset used (COCO), the model architecture (DeeplabV3+), and the task of semantic segmentation, but it does not provide information about the hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
