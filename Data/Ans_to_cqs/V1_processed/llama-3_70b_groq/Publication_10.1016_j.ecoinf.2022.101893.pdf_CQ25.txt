The purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is classification. Specifically, it is used for bird species recognition and classification. The models are trained to classify different species of birds based on their songs or audio features. The classification models are built using various deep learning architectures, such as CNN, and are evaluated based on their accuracy on a test set. The goal is to identify the species of birds from their audio recordings, which is a classic classification problem.
