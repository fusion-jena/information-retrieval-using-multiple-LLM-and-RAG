Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image segmentation tasks, particularly in the domain of plant leaf segmentation.

The context discusses the use of various CNN architectures, such as ResNet, VGG16, and Xception, and techniques like Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and bilinear up-sampling. It also mentions the adaptation of pre-trained models for transfer learning and the modification of network architectures to reduce computational complexity.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
