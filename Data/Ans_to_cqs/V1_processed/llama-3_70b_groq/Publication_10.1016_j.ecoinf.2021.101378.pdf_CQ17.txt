I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. The context appears to be related to ecology and forest disease management, with a focus on machine learning methods such as random forest and maximum entropy modeling. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
