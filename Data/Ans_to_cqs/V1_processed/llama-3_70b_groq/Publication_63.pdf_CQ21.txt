The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It only mentions that the trained model was applied to the test dataset, and the prediction accuracy was quantified by the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the respective dataset. There is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
