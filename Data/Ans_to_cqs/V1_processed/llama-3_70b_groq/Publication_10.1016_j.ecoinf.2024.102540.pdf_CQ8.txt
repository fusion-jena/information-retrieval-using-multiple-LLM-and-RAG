I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various machine learning models, including deep learning models, and their applications in detecting pests and diseases in sorghum fields. It also mentions the YOLOv5 family of models and their characteristics, but it does not provide information about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
