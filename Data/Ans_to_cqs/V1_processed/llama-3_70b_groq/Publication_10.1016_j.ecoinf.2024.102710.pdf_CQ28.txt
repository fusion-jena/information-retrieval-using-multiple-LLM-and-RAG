I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses various deep learning models such as BirdNet, VGGish, YAMNet, VGG16, and ResNet152-V2, and their applications in acoustic monitoring and annotation. It also mentions GitHub repositories and TensorFlow Hub models, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
