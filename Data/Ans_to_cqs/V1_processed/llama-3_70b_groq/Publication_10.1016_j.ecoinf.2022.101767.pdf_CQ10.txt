I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link. The context appears to be related to a study on the contribution of biodiversity and specific species to the Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) using online videos, particularly on YouTube. It discusses the methodology, data collection, and analysis, but does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
