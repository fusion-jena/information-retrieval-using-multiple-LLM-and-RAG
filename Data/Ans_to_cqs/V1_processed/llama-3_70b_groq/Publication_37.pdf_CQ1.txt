Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the classification techniques used for automated classification of migrating birds' flight calls, specifically comparing a "shallow learning" approach with a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation.

The context does mention a dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species, but it does not provide information on how this dataset was collected. It is possible that the dataset was collected through field recordings, sensors, or other means, but this information is not provided.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
