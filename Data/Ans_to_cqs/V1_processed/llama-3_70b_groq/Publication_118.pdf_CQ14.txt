I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the execution times of different feature representation methods, compares the variance of evaluation metrics, and shows a t-SNE plot generated using spectral indices. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method is used.
