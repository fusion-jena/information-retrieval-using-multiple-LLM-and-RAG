The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are:

1. Classification Accuracy (ACC)
2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
3. Precision
4. Recall
5. F-Score
6. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the DELMF and SCNN classifiers on the mammals_dataset and fishes_dataset. The F-Score is calculated using the formula: F-Score = 2 * (PRE * REC) / (PRE + REC).
