Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, to predict reproductive condition in fish. It discusses the advantages of machine learning methods over traditional methods and their potential for improving biological understanding in future research.

While the context mentions the use of machine learning algorithms, it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps involved in preparing the data for model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

If you're looking for general information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models, I can provide some general insights. Typically, preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization or scaling of features, feature selection, and data transformation. However, the specific preprocessing steps required can vary depending on the dataset, model, and problem at hand.
