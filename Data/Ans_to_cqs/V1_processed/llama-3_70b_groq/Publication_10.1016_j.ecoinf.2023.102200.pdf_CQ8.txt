I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or provide a link to a specific repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a collection of research papers and excerpts, but it does not include information about the availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
