I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning models, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and provides information about the different deep learning models used, including DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, and Inceptionresnetv2. However, it does not provide information about how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.
