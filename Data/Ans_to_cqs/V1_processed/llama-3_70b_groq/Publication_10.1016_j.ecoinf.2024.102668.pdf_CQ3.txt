I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to acoustic data and ecological informatics, discussing topics like device bias, acoustic indices, and audio signal processing. There is no mention of computer vision or image-related tasks that would require annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
