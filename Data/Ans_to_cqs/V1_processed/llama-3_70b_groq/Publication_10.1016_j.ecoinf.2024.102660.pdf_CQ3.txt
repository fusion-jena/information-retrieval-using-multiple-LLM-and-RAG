Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the architecture and performance of the Res_AUNet network for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, but it does not provide information on how the data was annotated. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
