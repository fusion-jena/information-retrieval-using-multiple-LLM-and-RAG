I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. It discusses the training process, including the use of dropout and ADAM optimization, and the data pre-processing and post-processing steps. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
