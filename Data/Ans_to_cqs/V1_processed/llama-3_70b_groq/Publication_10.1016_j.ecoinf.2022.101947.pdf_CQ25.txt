The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is used to classify individual tigers (Panthera tigris) from their pugmarks. The model is trained on data from captive Amur tigers and is used to classify free-ranging Amur tigers of unknown identity. The model generates a classification dendrogram using the FIT pairwise comparison model and is able to correctly predict the identity of tigers with 100% accuracy.
