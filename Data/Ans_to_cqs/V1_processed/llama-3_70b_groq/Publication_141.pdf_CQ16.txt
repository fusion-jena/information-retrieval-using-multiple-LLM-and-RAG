Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the performance of the CNN models at different taxonomic levels and the importance of morphological characters for classification. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training, such as validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or number of epochs. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
