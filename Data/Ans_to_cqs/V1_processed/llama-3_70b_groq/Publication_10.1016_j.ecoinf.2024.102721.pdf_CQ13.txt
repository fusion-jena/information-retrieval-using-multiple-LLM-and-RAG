Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, etc. The text only discusses the structure of the LSTM model and the use of Bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters, but it does not specify the actual hyperparameters used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
