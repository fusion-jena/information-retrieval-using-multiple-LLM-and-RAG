Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context focuses on the model architecture, training process, and dataset used, but it does not provide information on techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
