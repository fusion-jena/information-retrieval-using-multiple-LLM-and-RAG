I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses transductive few-shot learning, meta-learning methods, and various techniques used in audio event detection tasks, such as template matching, prototypical networks, and post-processing methods. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data is collected. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given context.
