I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses various studies and experiments on image classification and object recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but it does not provide information on the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the models.
