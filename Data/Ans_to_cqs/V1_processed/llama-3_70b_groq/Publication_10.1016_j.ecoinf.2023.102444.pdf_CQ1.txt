The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that bioclimatic variables were extracted from raster layers at a global level, which were downloaded from WorldClim v2.1 at a resolution of 2.5 min. This suggests that public datasets were used as a source of raw data. 

Additionally, the context does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting data for species and background points. It only mentions that these data were used in the analysis. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that public datasets were used as a source of raw data, but the specific methods used for collecting this data are not mentioned.
