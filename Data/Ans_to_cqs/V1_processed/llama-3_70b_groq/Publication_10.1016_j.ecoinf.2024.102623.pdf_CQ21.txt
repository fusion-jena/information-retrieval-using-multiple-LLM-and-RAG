Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, training parameters, and evaluation metrics. It does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
