The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on the workflow of preprocessing orthophotos into small labeled tiles, dividing the data into training, validation, and test datasets, and the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) used for prediction.

However, it can be inferred that the orthophotos were divided into small tiles of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, which might have involved some form of preprocessing, but the specific steps are not mentioned. Additionally, the context does not provide information on whether any normalization, scaling, or cleaning steps were performed on the data before feeding it into the CNN.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
