I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and statistical modeling, discussing topics such as spatial resolution, observer bias, and regularization paths. It mentions the ppmlasso package and references a paper by Guilbault et al. (2021), but does not provide any information about deep learning models or frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
