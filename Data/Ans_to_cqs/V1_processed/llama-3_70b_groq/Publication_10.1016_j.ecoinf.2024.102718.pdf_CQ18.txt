The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of various callbacks and metrics. According to the provided context, callbacks such as `eLROnPlateau`, `ModelCheckpoint`, and `EarlyStopping` are included to dynamically modify the learning rate while preserving the optimal model iteration according to the validation accuracy. 

Additionally, the model performance is monitored using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, model size, and analysis time. These metrics are meticulously recorded throughout the training phase, which spans 35 epochs with a batch size of 16. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance during training.
