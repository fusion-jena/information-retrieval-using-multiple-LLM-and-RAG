Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and performance of various deep learning models, such as LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, as well as the description of a custom model called ICSNet. It also discusses the relationship between mini-batch size and accuracy, and provides details about the data processing steps in the ICSNet model. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, including model serialization and platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
