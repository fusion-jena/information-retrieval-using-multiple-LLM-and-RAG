Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (CNN). The context primarily focuses on the comparison of the CNN and XGB models, their performance metrics, and the discussion of the results.

However, it can be inferred that the study used two independent validation data sets (ABMI plots and CCMEO) to evaluate the performance of the models. This suggests that some form of data splitting or validation was used to assess the models' performance. Additionally, the study mentions the use of photo-interpreted validation data sets, which might imply that the models were tested on unseen data.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, it cannot be concluded what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
