The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is designed to detect if there exists stratification in a reservoir or not, which is a binary classification problem. The model is trained to predict a categorical binary variable that stores the existence of stratification or not, taking the value of 0 when the reservoir is not stratified and 1 when it is stratified.
