I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link associated with it. The context appears to be related to land cover classification, green infrastructure, and habitat correlates, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other repository.
