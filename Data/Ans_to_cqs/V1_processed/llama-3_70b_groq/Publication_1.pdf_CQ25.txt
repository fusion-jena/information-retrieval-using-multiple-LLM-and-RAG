The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is detection and classification. The model is trained to detect and classify events of interest in wildlife data, such as detecting rare species. The model is progressively trained to reduce the amount of data reviewed by human analysts by orders of magnitude. This suggests that the model is tasked with identifying specific patterns or features in the data that are indicative of certain events or species, and then classifying them accordingly.
