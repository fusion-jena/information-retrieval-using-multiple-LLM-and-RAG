The provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on machine learning algorithms, specifically K-nearest neighbors and Decision Trees, and their application to a 5-class classification problem. It discusses the importance of using F-measure instead of Accuracy due to the imbalanced dataset and the use of stratiÔ¨Åed cross-validation for evaluation. Additionally, it touches on the topic of variable importance and its determination using tree-based methods. However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
