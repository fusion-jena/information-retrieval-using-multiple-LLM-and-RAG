The provided context appears to be a jumbled collection of Unicode characters, mathematical symbols, and random text. It does not contain any information about deep learning models or the hardware resources used for training them. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) are used for training the deep learning model based on the provided context.
