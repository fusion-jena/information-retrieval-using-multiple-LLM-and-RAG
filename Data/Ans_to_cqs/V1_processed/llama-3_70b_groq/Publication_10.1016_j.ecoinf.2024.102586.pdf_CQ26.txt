The provided context does not mention anything about addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on invasive alien species, discussing data sources, study areas, and data analysis using random forest models. There is no mention of deep learning pipelines or techniques to address data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
