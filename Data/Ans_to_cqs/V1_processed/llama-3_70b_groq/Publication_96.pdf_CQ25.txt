The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is detection and classification. Specifically, it is used to detect and map burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Landsat 8 imagery. The model is trained on spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas and uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm to differentiate spectral signatures of burned and unburned areas. The ultimate goal is to produce a map of burned areas with high accuracy, which is achieved in this study with an overall accuracy of 97%.
