The provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be discussing Earth Observation (EO) data and its processing using Google Earth Engine (GEE). It mentions the EOS data catalogue and the use of ee.ImageCollection() constructor to retrieve and filter data. There is no mention of deep learning or specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
