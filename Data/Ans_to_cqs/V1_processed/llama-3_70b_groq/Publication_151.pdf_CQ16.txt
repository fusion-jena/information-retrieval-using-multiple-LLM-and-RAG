The criteria used to determine when training is complete is when the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks. The training loss is checked every 50 epochs, and if there is no decrease in the loss function value in two consecutive checks, the training is stopped. This is mentioned in the context as "We check the training loss every 50 epochs and stop the training when the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks."
