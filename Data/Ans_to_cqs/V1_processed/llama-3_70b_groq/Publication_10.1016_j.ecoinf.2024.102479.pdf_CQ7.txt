The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the dataset was split into two distinct sets: 70% of the dataset was designated for model training, and the remaining 30% was used as the testing dataset. This is a common practice in machine learning, where the data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. 

However, it does not mention a validation set, which is typically used in deep learning to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The context focuses on the use of k-fold cross-validation and grid search cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
