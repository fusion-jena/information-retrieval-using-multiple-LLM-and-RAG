Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the methodology used for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Deep Learning techniques and Landsat 8 imagery.

However, it can be inferred that the spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas were collected and used as input for the classification model. The context also mentions the use of specific Landsat-8 spectral bands, NDVI, NBR, and delta NBR, which might have undergone some preprocessing steps before being used as inputs. Nevertheless, the exact preprocessing steps are not specified in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in this particular study.
