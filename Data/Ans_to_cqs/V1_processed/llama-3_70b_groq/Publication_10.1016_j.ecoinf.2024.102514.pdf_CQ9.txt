I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or article discussing various aspects of machine learning and water quality assessment, but it does not provide information about the data repository. The references cited in the context are mostly academic papers and do not seem to be related to a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
