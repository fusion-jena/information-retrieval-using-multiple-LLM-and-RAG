The provided context does not mention any data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be discussing species distribution models (SDMs) and the evaluation of their performance using various metrics, as well as techniques to reduce spatial autocorrelation in the input data. There is no mention of deep learning or computer vision-related concepts, which are typically associated with data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
