The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the implementation of CART and Random Forest regression models for predicting water depths, including the preprocessing of remote sensing data and fine-tuning of model parameters. 

However, in general, the common criteria used to split data for deep learning model training include:

1. Random Split: A random proportion of the data is assigned to the training set, and the remaining data is split between the validation and test sets.
2. Stratified Split: The data is split in a way that maintains the same proportion of classes in each set (e.g., 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing).
3. K-Fold Cross-Validation: The data is divided into k folds, and each fold is used as a test set while the remaining folds are used for training.

Without further information, it is unclear which criteria were used in this specific study.
