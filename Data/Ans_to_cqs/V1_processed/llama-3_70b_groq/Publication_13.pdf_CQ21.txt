Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

Specifically, the context mentions that "Classification error was visualized as a scaled confusion matrix" and that "Loss and accuracy development during training of models are reported in Figures S2, S3." This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as loss and accuracy, and that a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the classification error.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps as a postprocessing step. Saliency maps are a technique used to interpret the output of a model, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, the answer is that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include metrics calculation and the creation of a confusion matrix, but it is unclear whether saliency maps are involved.
