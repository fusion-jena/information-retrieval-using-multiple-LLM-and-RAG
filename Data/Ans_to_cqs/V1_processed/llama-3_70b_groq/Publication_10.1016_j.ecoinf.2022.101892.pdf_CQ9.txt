I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be a collection of references and descriptions of various deep learning models and techniques, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
