Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, specifically U-net, for semantic segmentation and species distribution mapping in high-resolution imagery. It discusses the advantages of deep learning methods in achieving human-level classification accuracy and their ability to process large amounts of data.

The context does mention the Inria aerial image labeling benchmark, which might imply that some form of annotation is involved in the process. However, it does not provide specific details about the annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
