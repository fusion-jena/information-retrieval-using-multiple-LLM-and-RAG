The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a large dataset (AT0) with 3458 natural thumbnails in average per species, which could contribute to the model's generalizability. Additionally, the model was tested on a separate dataset (T2 test-dataset), which could be a form of cross-validation.

However, there is no mention of other measures such as stratified splitting, data augmentation, or regularization techniques that are commonly used to ensure generalizability. The context only provides information about the experiments conducted to compare the model's performance on different datasets of varying sizes, but it does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure generalizability.
