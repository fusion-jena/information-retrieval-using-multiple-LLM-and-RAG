Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy and precision. The confusion matrix is used to calculate these metrics. The accuracy of the model is also compared with other models in Table 4, where the accuracy of each model is listed as a percentage. Additionally, the loss of each model is also compared in Table 4. However, there is no mention of recall as a metric used to evaluate the performance of the model.
