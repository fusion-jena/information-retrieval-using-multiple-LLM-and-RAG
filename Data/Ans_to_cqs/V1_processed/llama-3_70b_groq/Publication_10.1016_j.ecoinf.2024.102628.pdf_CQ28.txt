The context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the fast.ai platform was used to train and validate the models for the classification of 2D point cloud images. Fast.ai is a deep learning library, not a deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
