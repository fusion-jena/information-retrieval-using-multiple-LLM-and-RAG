I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land use, land cover, and time series data, with discussions on LSTM models, FMOP models, and Markov chain models. There is no mention of data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
