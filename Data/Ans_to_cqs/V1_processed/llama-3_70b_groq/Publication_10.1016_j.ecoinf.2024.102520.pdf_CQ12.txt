I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model being used in the pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing image processing and analysis, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model being used. The references cited are also not related to deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
