I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article in the field of ecological informatics, and it mentions that "Data will be made available on request" (Table 1), but it does not provide a specific link to a data repository. Additionally, the context mentions a link to supplementary data (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102436), but it does not seem to be related to a deep learning pipeline.
