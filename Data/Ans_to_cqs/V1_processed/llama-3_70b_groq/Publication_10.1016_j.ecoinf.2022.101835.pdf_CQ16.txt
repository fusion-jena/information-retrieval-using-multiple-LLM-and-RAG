Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters and their ranges for the machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and LightGBM. It also discusses the evaluation metrics used, including mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
