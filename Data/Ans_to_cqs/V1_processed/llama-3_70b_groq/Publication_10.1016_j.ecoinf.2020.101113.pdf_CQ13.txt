Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. The context only discusses the model architecture (ResNet50), the pre-training dataset (ImageNet), and the input window size (2 seconds) for the spectrogram classification task. It also mentions the need for future efforts to investigate optimal data augmentation methods and to improve the efficiency of prediction. However, it does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during model training.
