The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. Specifically, it is used for crop classification, particularly for extracting rice-growing areas. The model is trained to classify Sentinel-2 images into different crop types, with a focus on rice. The random forest classification method is used, which achieves a high classification accuracy of over 90%. The goal is to estimate the crop chlorophyll content in the field scale, and the classification of crop-growing areas is a prerequisite for this task.
