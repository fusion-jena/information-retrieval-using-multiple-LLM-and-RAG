I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or the process followed to do so. The context discusses various topics such as event-stream processing, machine learning, optogenetics, and edge computing, but it does not provide information on deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
