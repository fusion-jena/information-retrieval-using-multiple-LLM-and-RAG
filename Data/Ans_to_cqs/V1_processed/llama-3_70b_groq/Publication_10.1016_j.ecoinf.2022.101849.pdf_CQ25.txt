The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification. This is evident from the mention of "PNV mapping in a classification setting" in the first paragraph. The authors are using machine learning methods, including neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting, and k-nearest neighbors, to predict the potential natural vegetation (PNV) in a classification setting. This suggests that the model is intended to classify different types of vegetation or land cover into predefined categories.
