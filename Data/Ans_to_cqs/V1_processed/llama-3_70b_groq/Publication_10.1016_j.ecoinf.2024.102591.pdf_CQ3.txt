I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and wildfire science, with mentions of Google Earth Engine, Sentinel-2 data, and machine learning algorithms. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
