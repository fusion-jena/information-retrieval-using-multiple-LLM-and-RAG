The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, i.e., whether it is done through grid search, random search, or some other method. However, it does mention that the regression hyperparameter tuning has been performed for all nine prediction models, and the best regression parameter has been used for training the model. Additionally, it mentions that the parameters were selected during the 5-fold cross-validation, and the hyperparameters were adjusted according to the selection criteria to determine the most appropriate configuration for the prediction model. 

Unfortunately, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization.
