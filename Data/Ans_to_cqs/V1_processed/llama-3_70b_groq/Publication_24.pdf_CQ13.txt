I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. The context provides information about the dataset, the ML pipeline, and the CNN architecture, but it does not specify the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
