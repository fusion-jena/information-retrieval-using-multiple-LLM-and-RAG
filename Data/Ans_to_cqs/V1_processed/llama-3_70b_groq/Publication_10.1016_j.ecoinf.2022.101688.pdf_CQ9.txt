I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various experiments and techniques used in bioacoustics research, including the use of pre-trained CNNs and transfer learning, but it does not provide information about the availability of the data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
