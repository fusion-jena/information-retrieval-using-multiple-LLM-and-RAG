I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning pipelines or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context is focused on the Python package nasawebservice, which is used for automatic MODIS data ingestion from the NASA MODIS/VIIRS Land Products Web Service. It discusses the package's features, dependencies, and methods for retrieving MODIS data, but does not mention deep learning or any related datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
