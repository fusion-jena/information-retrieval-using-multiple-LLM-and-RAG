Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It does mention that the model was trained on the COCO dataset, which is a large and widely used dataset, but it does not provide information on whether cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques were used to ensure generalizability. 

However, it can be inferred that the model was not trained directly on the landscape photos, but rather the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset. This might suggest that the model was not overfitted to a specific dataset, but it is still unclear whether other measures were taken to ensure generalizability. 

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
