I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text discusses the use of pre-trained CNNs, the importance of model training, and the application of deep learning in ecology and evolutionary biology, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the model. The full instructions and options for model training are mentioned to be included in Figure 1 and provided on the GitHub repository, but this information is not available in the given context.
