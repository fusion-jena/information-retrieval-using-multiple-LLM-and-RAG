I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context provides information about various research papers and studies related to coral reefs, fish, and marine ecosystems, but it does not provide information about the availability of a deep learning pipeline or its data repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
