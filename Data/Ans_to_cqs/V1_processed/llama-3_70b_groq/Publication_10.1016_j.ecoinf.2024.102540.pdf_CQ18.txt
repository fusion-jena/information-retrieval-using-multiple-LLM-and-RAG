The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the hyperparameters used for training, such as the number of epochs and batch size, as well as the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the trained models. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
