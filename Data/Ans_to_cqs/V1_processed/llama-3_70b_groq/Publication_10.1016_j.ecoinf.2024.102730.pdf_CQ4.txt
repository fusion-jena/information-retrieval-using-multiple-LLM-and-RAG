Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning in ecology, vegetation studies, and plant species identification. It discusses various models, including convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks, but does not delve into data augmentation techniques.

While data augmentation is a crucial step in deep learning pipelines, the provided context does not provide information on specific techniques used in this domain. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
