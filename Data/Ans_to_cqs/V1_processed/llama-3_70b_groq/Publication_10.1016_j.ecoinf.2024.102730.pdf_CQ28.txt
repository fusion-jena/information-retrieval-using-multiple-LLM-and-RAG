I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform of a deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of research papers and articles related to ecology, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform of a specific deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
