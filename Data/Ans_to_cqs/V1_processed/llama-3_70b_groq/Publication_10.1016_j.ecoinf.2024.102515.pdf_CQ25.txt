The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mention of "image recognition model" and the discussion of tweets containing images, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might be intended for image classification or object detection tasks. The goal of the model would be to analyze images shared on Twitter and identify the objects or species depicted in them, potentially for biodiversity monitoring or species distribution applications.
