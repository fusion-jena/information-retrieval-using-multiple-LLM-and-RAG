I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forests, to predict reproductive condition in fish, and does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
