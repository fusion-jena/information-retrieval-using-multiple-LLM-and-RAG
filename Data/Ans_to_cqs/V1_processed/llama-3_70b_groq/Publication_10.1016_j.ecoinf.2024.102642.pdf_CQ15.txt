The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text focuses on the annotation process, annotation variability, and aggregation methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models. It discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the evaluation of their performance on different annotation sets, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
