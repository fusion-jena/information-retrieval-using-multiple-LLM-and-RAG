The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the concept of structurally incomplete target labels, where labels are not fully available or contain errors, and how to handle such scenarios in regression tasks. It discusses various approaches to handle incomplete labels, such as random reduction, non-random (biased) reduction, and partial imputation algorithms.

However, it does not mention specific techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to handle class imbalance or biased datasets, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
