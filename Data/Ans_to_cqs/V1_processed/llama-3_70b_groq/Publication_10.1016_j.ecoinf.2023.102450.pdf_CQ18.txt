I don't know.

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to animal tracking and behavior recognition using machine learning and computer vision techniques. It discusses the use of few-shot learning and Siamese networks for training models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training.
