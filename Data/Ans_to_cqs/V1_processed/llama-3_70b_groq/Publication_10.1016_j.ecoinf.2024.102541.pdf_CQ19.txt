Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses various models such as YOLOv5s, CSPDarknet53, MobileNetV2, and WildARe-YOLO, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to implement these models.

The references cited in the text are related to research papers and conferences, but they do not mention the frameworks used for implementation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
