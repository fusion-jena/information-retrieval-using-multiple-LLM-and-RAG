The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the model selection, training process, and some model parameters, but it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
