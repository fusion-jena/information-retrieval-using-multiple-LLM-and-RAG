Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is video. This is evident from the mention of the GBIF database containing over 2300 videos of animals, and the fact that every frame from each of these videos has been manually annotated to indicate whether or not it contains an animal. Additionally, the context mentions video encoding standards such as H.264, which further supports the use of video data in the pipeline. 

There is no mention of audio, CSV, or other data formats being used in the pipeline. However, it is worth noting that the pipeline involves extracting motion vectors from video streams, which could potentially be used as input features for the deep learning model.
