The provided context does not explicitly mention the learning rate used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention the optimizer used, which is either Adam or SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent). The context also provides information about other hyperparameters, such as the dropout probability (0.3 after the second to last hidden layer) and the hyperparameters used in the CNN architectures, which include kernel size, convolutional depth, and fully connected size. These hyperparameters are listed in Table 2, but the learning rate is not mentioned.
