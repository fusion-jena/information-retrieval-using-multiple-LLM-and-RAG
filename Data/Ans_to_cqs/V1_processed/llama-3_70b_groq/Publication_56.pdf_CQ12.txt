The query is asking about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, specifically whether it is a CNN, RNN, or Transformer. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the pipeline or the type of deep learning model used in it.

The context does mention various deep learning models and techniques, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and sensitivity analysis. It also mentions papers that use these models for tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and crop yield estimation.

However, it does not provide specific information about the pipeline mentioned in the query. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
