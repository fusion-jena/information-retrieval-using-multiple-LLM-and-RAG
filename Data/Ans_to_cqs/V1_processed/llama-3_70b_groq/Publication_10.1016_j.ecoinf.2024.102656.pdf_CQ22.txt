The query asks about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model in the provided context. The context discusses the performance of five component models (GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS) and an ensemble model, but none of them are deep learning models.

The context does mention that the performance of the models is evaluated using two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). These metrics are used to assess the predictive accuracy of the models. The context provides a categorization of the AUC and TSS values into excellent, good, moderate, and poor performance.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models are AUC and TSS, but these are not specifically for a deep learning model.
