The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the annotation process is based on the information provided by the available farm records filled by the stock persons and the output of the YAMNet-based goat vocalization detection algorithm. Additionally, it mentions that cameras were positioned in the barns, and videos were transmitted via WiFi to a digital video recorder and stored on a hard disk. These videos, together with farm records, were used to support animal scientists in the labeling of goat vocalizations.

It also mentions that a web-based annotation tool was designed and developed to support the annotation process. The list of possible events (i.e., event types) was provided by domain experts, namely animal scientists and farmers.

However, it does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
