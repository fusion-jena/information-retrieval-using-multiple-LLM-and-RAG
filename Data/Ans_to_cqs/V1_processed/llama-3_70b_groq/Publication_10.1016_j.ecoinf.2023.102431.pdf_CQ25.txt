The purpose of the model is not explicitly stated as a deep learning model, but rather as a linear discriminant analysis model used for classification. The model is used to classify species or sex based on the extracted features from footprints. The model generates a discrimination line or hyperplane to separate the classes, and then assigns a probability value to each classification using a logistic regression model. The model is not used for segmentation or detection, but rather for classification.
