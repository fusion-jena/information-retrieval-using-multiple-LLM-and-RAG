The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models, including mean loss, and the architecture of the models. It also discusses the optimization method used, which is based on stochastic gradient descent algorithms, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, as this information is not provided in the given context.
