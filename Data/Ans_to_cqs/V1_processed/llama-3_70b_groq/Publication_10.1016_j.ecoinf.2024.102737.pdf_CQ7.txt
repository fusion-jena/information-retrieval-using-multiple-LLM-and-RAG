The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, we can infer some information from the given tables and text.

From Table 2, we can see that the data is split into training and testing sets for each experiment. The sizes of these sets vary across experiments, but the context does not provide a clear explanation for how the data was split.

The text mentions that the initial experiments referred to several issues, including architecture, data augmentation usage, feature extraction enhancement, and handling different poses. It also mentions that the training set included 21 different individuals (classes) each having 4 different 320 Ã— 320 pixels images, and the test size included 99 other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set.

However, the context does not provide a clear answer to the question of what criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training. It is possible that the data was split randomly, or based on some other criteria not mentioned in the context. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the exact criteria used for data splitting.

In summary, the context does not provide a clear answer to the question, and more information would be needed to determine the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
