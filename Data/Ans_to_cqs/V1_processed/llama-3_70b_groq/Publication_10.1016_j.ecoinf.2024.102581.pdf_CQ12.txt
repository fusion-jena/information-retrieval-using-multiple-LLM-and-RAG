The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from Table 4, which lists the search space of CNN hyperparameters to be explored, including the number of convolution layers, filters, filter size, batch size, epochs, and optimizer. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a CNN model optimizer and the evolution of a near-optimal CNN.
