The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. The data augmentation techniques used include horizontal flip, add/subtract intensity, Gaussian blur, additive Gaussian noise, and a special "Fog" augmentation function from the imgaug library. These techniques are applied with different probabilities to the training data. Additionally, the context mentions the use of weight decay with a value of 0.0005, which can be considered a form of regularization. However, it does not mention other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
