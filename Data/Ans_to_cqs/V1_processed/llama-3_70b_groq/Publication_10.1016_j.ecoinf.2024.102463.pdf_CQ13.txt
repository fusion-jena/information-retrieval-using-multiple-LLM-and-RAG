Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the HyperBand algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, partial training, and successive halving, but it does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters being optimized.

However, it does mention that the network has two convolution layers, and the size and associated max-pooling will be determined in a certain interval. It also mentions that the architecture involves a large number of hyperparameters related to the different types of layers (convolutional or recurrent) and therefore a large number of parameters.

If you're looking for specific hyperparameters, I would recommend checking the reference book (Goodfellow et al., 2016) or other external sources that provide more detailed information on the deep learning model architecture and its hyperparameters.
