Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. Specifically, a dropout layer was used to inactivate random nodes that contain learnable weights, which helps to reduce overfitting of the CNN model. There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.
