The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated on the test set in each replication, and the performance metrics are averaged over three replications for eventual model assessment. This suggests that the model performance is monitored through the evaluation of performance metrics on the test set, but the specific strategy or metrics used are not mentioned.
