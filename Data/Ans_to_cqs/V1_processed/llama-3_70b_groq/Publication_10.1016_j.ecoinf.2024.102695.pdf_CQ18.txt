The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model uses an early stopping strategy to prevent overfitting issues, which implies that the model's performance is being monitored during training. The early stopping strategy stops the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data. 

It is also worth noting that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, which is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate the model's performance during training. The validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and to monitor its performance during training. However, the specific strategy used to monitor the model's performance is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
