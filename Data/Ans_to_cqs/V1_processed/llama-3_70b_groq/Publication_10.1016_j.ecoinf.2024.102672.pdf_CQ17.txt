Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in Table 1, where the initial hyperparameters space includes the dropout rate of the dropout layer, with values of 0.2 and 0.4. This suggests that dropout was used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in the model. However, there is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.
