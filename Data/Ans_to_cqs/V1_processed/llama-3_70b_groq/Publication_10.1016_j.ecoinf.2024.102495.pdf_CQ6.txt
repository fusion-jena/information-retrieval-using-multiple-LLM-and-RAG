Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of feature extraction parameters and the performance evaluation of different deep learning model configurations.

However, it can be inferred that the input data is transformed into a matrix or vector format before being fed into the deep learning algorithm, as mentioned in the section 2.2.3. Deep learning. This transformation might involve some preprocessing steps, but the specific steps are not mentioned.

Additionally, the context discusses the feature extraction process, which is an essential step in preparing the data for training a deep learning model. The feature extraction parameters, such as the number of bands, frames, hop length, and FFT window length, are optimized to improve the model's performance. However, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
