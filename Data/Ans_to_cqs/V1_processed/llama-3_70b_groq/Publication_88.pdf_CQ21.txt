The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics and techniques used to assess the performance of the models.

From the context, we can infer that the following postprocessing steps might be involved:

1. Metrics calculation: The context mentions the calculation of metrics such as Overall Accuracy (OA), F1-Score, Alarm Area (AA), and Recall. These metrics are likely calculated after model training to evaluate its performance.

2. Confusion matrix: Although not explicitly mentioned, the calculation of metrics like OA and F1-Score suggests that a confusion matrix might be involved in the postprocessing steps.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or other postprocessing steps like feature importance, partial dependence plots, or model interpretability techniques.

In conclusion, while the context provides some hints about the evaluation metrics used, it does not provide a comprehensive list of postprocessing steps involved after model training.
