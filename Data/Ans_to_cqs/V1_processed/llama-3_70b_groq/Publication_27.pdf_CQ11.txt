I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of encoded characters and symbols, which do not seem to contain any information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The text does not mention any specific repository names like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, nor does it provide a link to any such repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
