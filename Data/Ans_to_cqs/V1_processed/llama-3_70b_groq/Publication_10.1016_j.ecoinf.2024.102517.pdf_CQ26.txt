Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the framework of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss and the challenges of bioacoustic noise reduction in field recordings. It discusses the limitations of traditional noise reduction methods and the potential of deep learning for bioacoustic noise reduction, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
