Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the advantages and characteristics of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Online Sequential ELM (OSELM), such as their ability to handle big data, require minimal training time, and generalize well. It also explains the differences between online learning and batch learning. However, it does not provide information on how to monitor model performance during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
