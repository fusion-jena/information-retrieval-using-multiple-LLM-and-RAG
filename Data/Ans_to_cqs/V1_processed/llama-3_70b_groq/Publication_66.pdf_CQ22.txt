The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of positive predicted value (PPV) and negative predicted value (NPV) in the context of hidden Markov models (HMMs). These metrics are often used to evaluate the performance of classification models, but it is not clear if they were used to evaluate the deep learning model as well. 

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the comparison of predictions obtained from deep learning models with other methods, but it does not provide details on the specific metrics used for this comparison. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
