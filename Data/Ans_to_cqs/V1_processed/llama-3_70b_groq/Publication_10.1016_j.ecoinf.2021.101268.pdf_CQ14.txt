I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized. It discusses the performance of different models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) on a Peruvian Amazon forestry dataset, and provides accuracy results for raw and pre-processed images. It also mentions some visualization techniques used to analyze the models' behavior, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.
