According to the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: 

1. Training loss: The model's training loss was 0.256.
2. Training accuracy: The model's training accuracy was 0.899.
3. Validation loss: The model's validation loss was 0.298.
4. Validation accuracy: The model's validation accuracy was 0.891.

Additionally, the context also mentions precision and recall metrics, but these are used to evaluate the performance of the workflow in extracting relevant information from social media posts, not specifically the deep learning model. The precision and recall metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of combining textual and visual analysis in extracting relevant information.
