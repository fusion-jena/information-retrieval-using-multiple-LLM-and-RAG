Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs. The text only discusses the architecture and performance of the SeedNet model, as well as comparisons with other deep learning models, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
