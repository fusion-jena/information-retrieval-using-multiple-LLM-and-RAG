The provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text only discusses the adaptation and configuration of TensorFlow for automated species identification of Triatominae, vectors of Chagas disease, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
