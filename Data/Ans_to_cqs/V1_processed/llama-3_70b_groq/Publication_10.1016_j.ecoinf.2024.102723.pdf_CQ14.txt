Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses various topics such as neural networks, Bayesian approach, uncertainty quantification, and model uncertainty in deep learning, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
