Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision and success plots. The precision plot evaluates the center location error of the tracking algorithm, and it denotes the average Euclidean distance between the centroid locations of the tracked targets and the manually labeled ground truths. Additionally, the percentage of video frames considering the Euclidean distance values existing within a specified threshold is also calculated. There is no mention of accuracy, recall, or other metrics in the provided context.
