Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context only discusses the steps involved in preparing the dataset, training the model, and improving its performance using techniques such as attention mechanisms. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
