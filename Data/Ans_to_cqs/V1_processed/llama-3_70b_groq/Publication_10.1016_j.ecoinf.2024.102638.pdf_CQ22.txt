The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models, but it does discuss the evaluation metrics used for prediction models in general. The metrics mentioned are:

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
2. Mean Square Error (MSE)
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
5. Mean Absolute Scale Error (MASE)
6. Coefficient of determination (R2)

These metrics are used to measure the performance accuracy and suitability of prediction models. However, the context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, which are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models.
