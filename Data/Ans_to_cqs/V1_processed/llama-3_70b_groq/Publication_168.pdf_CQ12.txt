Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the mention of "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)" in the introduction as one of the deep learning methods used for HSI classification. Additionally, the context provides details about the architecture of a CNN, including the use of convolutional kernels, pooling layers, and ReLU activation functions. Furthermore, the context mentions specific CNN architectures, such as the 1-D-CNN designed by Hu et al. and the multiscale CNN used in combination with LSTM. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a type of CNN.
