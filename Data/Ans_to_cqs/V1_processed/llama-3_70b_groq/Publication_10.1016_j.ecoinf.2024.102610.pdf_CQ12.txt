I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model being used in the pipeline. The context discusses machine learning methodologies, feature elimination, and model performance, but it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot determine whether a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or any other type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
