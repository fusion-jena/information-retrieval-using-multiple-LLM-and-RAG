I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the generation of training and testing datasets, the use of a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier, and the input features used for the model. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
