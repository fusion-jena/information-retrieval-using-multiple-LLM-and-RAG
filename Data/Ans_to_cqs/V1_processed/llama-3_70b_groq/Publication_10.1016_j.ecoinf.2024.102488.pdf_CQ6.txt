The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of fusion quality, feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV), and classification models. 

However, it can be inferred that feature selection is an essential preprocessing step in this study, as RFECV is used to select the optimal features that can reduce redundancy and improve model performance. 

Other preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether these steps were involved in the study or not.
