Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data collection method is not explicitly mentioned. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of FÎ¸, sampling, ODE solver, network and preconditioning, training, and loss weighting. It also references various research papers and publications in the field of computer vision and machine learning.

However, it can be inferred that the data collection method might involve trawl camera images, as mentioned in the paper "A deep learning-based method to identify and count pelagic and mesopelagic fishes from trawl camera images" by Allken et al. (2021). This suggests that the raw data might be collected through camera images or sensors.

Additionally, the context mentions a dataset, but it does not provide information on how the data was collected. It is possible that the dataset is a public dataset, but this is not explicitly stated.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
