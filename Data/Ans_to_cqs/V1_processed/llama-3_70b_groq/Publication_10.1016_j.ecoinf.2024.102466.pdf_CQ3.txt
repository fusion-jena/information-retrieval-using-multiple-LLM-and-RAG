The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is inferred from the text, which mentions that YOLO v7, a pre-trained object detection model, is used to label images preliminarily, and then the data annotations are further processed via LabelImg. LabelImg is a tool that facilitates adjustments to the boundaries and classes of bird species based on the labels detected by YOLO v7. This suggests that the annotations involve drawing bounding boxes around the objects of interest (in this case, birds) and assigning class labels to them. There is no mention of instance segmentation, which is a more advanced annotation technique that involves segmenting individual objects at the pixel level.
