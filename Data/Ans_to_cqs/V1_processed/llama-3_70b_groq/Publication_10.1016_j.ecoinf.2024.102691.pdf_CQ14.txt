Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the model architecture, training process, and attention mechanism, but it does not provide information about hyperparameter optimization. 

It is mentioned that the input image size is set to 512 Ã— 512, the maximum batch size is limited to 4, and the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer is used with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. However, it does not explain how these hyperparameters were chosen or optimized.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
