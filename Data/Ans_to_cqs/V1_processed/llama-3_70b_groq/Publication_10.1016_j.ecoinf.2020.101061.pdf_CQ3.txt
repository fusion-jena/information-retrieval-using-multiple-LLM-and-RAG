The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. According to the text, the authors manually annotated training tiles using the program RectLabel, which suggests that they drew bounding boxes around the trees in the images. This is further supported by the mention of comparing the hand-annotations to a LiDAR canopy height model and removing any trees less than 3 m in height, which implies that the annotations were in the form of bounding boxes around individual trees. There is no mention of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques being used.
