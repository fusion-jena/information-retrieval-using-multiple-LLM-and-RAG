Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms to predict total phosphorus concentration in rivers and the use of deep learning techniques in agriculture. It also discusses the architecture of a neural network, data normalization, and data partitioning. However, it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

The context does mention the use of spectral reflectance data, which suggests that the raw data might have been collected using sensors or remote sensing technologies. However, this is only an inference, and the actual method of data collection is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I do not know the exact methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
