I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of PyTorch, a machine learning framework, and skorch, a scikit-learn compatible neural network library, for training and evaluating the model. It also mentions the use of scikit-learn for data pre-processing, model selection, and evaluation. However, it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
