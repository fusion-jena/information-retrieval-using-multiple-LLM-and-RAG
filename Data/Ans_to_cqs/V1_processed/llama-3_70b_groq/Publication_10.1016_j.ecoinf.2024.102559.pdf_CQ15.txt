I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be related to machine learning and classification tasks, but it does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The papers cited are about scikit-learn, habitat suitability, and land use classification, but they do not mention deep learning or optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
