I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of references and some statistical data, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The paper "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022) is mentioned, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform either. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
