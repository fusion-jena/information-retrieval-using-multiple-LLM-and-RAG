The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). The AUC values are categorized as excellent (>0.9), good (0.9-0.8), moderate (0.8-0.7), and poor (<0.7), while the TSS values are categorized as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75-0.4), and poor (<0.4). This comprehensive assessment ensures a robust understanding of model performance and aids in reliable predictions of species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.
