I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. It mentions the Data Catalogue, which is an online infrastructure for storing datasets generated by systems, programs, and individual researchers within the Institute, but it does not provide a link to a specific repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Additionally, it mentions GitHub, but it does not provide a specific link to a repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.
