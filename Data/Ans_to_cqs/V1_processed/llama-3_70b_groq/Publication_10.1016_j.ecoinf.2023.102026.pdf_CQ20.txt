I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, machine learning, and ecological informatics, but it does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training a model. The text mentions random forests, generalized linear models, and simulation, but it does not mention deep learning or the hardware resources required for training such models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
