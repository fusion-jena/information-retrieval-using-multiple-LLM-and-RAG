The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is monitored through the computation of the compound loss, which is a combination of softmax cross-entropy and regularization loss. The cross-entropy loss measures the distance between the predicted and true distributions, and the regularization loss helps to reduce overfitting. The softmax function is used to normalize the loss values between 0 and 1. 

Additionally, the 10-fold cross-validation (CV) prediction accuracy and loss of each deep learning (DL) classification model are plotted in boxplots, which suggests that the model performance is evaluated using these metrics. However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance during training is not mentioned.
