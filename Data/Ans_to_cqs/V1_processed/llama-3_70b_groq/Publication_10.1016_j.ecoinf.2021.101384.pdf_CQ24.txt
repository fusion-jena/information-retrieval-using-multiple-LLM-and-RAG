I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, randomness, or random seed values. The text appears to discuss a workflow for processing fisheries data, using techniques such as data classification, spatio-temporal aggregation, and FAIR data principles. It also mentions specific tools and platforms, such as SPARQL, D4Science, and NetCDF files. However, there is no mention of deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
