The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some evaluation metrics and techniques used to assess the model's performance. 

The context mentions that after 10-fold cross-validation and 10-fold bootstrapping, the models were assessed based on the mean values for Area Under the Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistics (TSS), Cohen's KAPPA, point-biserial correlation (COR), and Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC). It also mentions that bootstrapping was used to provide unbiased predictive accuracy with a sufficiently low variance. 

Additionally, the context states that the sensitivity-specificity sum maximization technique was employed to determine the model threshold, which allows for accurate prediction of species distribution. 

However, it does not mention specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I do not know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the provided context.
