The purpose of the deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is for classification. The model is intended to identify which birds are providing care to the chicks and how often they do so. The CNN is useful for this task because it can provide a generalized identification solution, and it can handle a large number of features required for classification.
