I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a research paper in the field of ecological informatics, and it does not mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses topics such as CO2 emission accounts, carbon neutrality, and data availability, but it does not provide any information related to deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
