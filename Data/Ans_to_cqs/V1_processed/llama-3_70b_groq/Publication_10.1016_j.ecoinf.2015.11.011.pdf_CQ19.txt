The provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only mentions "machine learning techniques" being brought together with segmentation to more automatically classify images, but it does not provide details on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
