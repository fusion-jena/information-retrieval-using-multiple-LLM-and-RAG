Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the use of domain adversarial training, CNN models, and between-datasets classification, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
