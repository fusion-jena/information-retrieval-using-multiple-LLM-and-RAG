The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information about the dataset and the evaluation process.

From Table 2, we can see that the data is split into training samples and validation samples. The number of training samples and validation samples for each class is provided. Additionally, the context mentions that a five-fold cross-validation was used in the RFECV process to select the number and combinations of features.

It can be inferred that the data was split into training and validation sets, and possibly further split into folds for cross-validation. However, the exact criteria used to split the data (e.g., random split, stratified split, etc.) are not specified.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
