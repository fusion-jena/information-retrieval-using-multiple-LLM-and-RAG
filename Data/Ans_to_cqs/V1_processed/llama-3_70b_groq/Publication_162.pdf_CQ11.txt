I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various papers and conferences, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link as an answer to this query.
