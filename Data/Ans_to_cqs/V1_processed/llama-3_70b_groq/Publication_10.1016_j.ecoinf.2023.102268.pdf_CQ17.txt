The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, but it does not specify any regularization techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
