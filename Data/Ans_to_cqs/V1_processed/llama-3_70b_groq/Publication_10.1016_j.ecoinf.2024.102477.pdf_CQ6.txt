Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods, such as SLSTM and SGRU, for time-series prediction and their performance comparison with other models. It also discusses the hyperparameter optimization of an SVR model, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps.

However, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include:

* Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors
* Normalization or scaling: transforming the data to a common range to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model
* Feature selection: selecting the most relevant features to include in the model
* Data transformation: transforming the data into a suitable format for the model, such as converting categorical variables into numerical variables

These preprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset, and model being used. Unfortunately, the provided context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved in the mentioned studies.
