The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide some information about the training and validation sets used in the experiment.

From the context, we can see that there are separate sections for "Train." and "Valid." which suggest that the data was split into training and validation sets. The numbers of misclassified images and accuracy percentages are provided for both sets.

However, the context does not provide information on how the data was split, what proportion of the data was used for training and validation, or whether a test set was used.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this experiment.
