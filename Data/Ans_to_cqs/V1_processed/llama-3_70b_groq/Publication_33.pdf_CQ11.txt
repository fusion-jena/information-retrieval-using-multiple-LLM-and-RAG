I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The references provided are to scientific papers and articles, but not to a data repository link. The context mentions arXiv, which is a repository of electronic preprints, but it is not a data repository link specific to the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
