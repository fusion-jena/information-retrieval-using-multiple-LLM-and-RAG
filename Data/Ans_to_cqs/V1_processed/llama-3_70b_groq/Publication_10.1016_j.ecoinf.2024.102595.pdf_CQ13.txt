Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. While it mentions hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV with cross-validation, it does not specify the hyperparameters used for the deep learning model. It only mentions hyperparameters for traditional machine learning approaches, such as 'max_depth' in tree-based models and 'learning_rate' in boosting models. Therefore, I don't know the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
