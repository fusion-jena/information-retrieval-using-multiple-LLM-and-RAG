Based on the provided context, it appears that the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through fieldwork expeditions. Specifically, three fieldwork missions were conducted during 2021 (June, August, and October) to account for seasonal changes in color and flowering patterns that helped identify each individual species of sub-alpine shrubs. This suggests that the raw data was collected through direct observation and measurement in the field, rather than through surveys, sensors, or public datasets. The fieldwork expeditions were likely used to collect images of the shrubs, which were then annotated with corresponding labels to create a dataset for training the deep learning model.
