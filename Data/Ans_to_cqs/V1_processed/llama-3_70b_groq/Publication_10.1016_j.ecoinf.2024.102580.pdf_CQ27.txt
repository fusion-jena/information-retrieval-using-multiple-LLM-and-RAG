Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the workflow used to select, develop, train, and evaluate the deep learning models, as well as the results achieved by the semantic segmentation model. It does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed.

The context does provide a link to a Git repository (https://git.wur.nl/deep-learning-tools-for-marine-ecosystem-monitoring) where the deep learning and post-processing scripts, along with the 2012 aerial imagery and data output, can be found. However, it does not provide details on the deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
