Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data, specifically RGB images. The text mentions that deep learning methods can be applied to achieve a valid biocrust classification on species and/or genus level based on standard RGB image data. Additionally, it discusses the use of neural networks for semantic image segmentation, which involves classifying every pixel of an image at the highest possible accuracy.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Similarly, there is no indication of CSV (Comma Separated Values) files being used as input data.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data, specifically RGB images.
