The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Neural Network (NN). The context mentions that the authors utilized five machine learning methodologies, including NN models based on Hardesty (2017), to estimate the average concentration of TSM in the lake using solely wind speed as input. However, it does not specify the use of CNN, RNN, or Transformer models.
