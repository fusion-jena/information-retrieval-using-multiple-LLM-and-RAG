The purpose of the deep learning models in this research is image classification. This is evident from the context provided, particularly in section 2.7, where it is mentioned that the classification layer of the models was replaced for fine-tuning them on the crop-weed dataset. This implies that the models were trained to classify images into different categories. Additionally, the selection of deep learning models in section 2.3 also suggests that the purpose is image classification, as the models mentioned (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, etc.) are commonly used for image classification tasks.
