The hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model are optimized using the IKHO algorithm, which is a combination of the Krill Herd (KH) algorithm and a free search (FS) operator. The KH algorithm is a swarm intelligence-based approach inspired by the swarming behavior of krills, and it modifies the Lagrangian approach in a d-dimensional decision space. The IKHO algorithm is designed to avoid the local optimal problem of the KH algorithm. However, the context does not provide further details on how the IKHO algorithm optimizes the hyperparameters, such as whether it uses a grid search, random search, or another method.
