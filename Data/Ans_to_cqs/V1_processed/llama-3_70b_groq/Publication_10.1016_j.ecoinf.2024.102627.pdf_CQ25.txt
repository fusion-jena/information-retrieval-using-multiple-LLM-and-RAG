The purpose of the deep learning model is to predict species assemblages worldwide based on presence-only observations. Specifically, it is a set-valued prediction or set-valued classification model, which means it aims to predict a set of labels (species) rather than a single label. The model is trained on presence-only data, combining all species, and outputs categorical probabilities associated with each species. These probabilities are then thresholded to obtain the predicted set of species (assemblage) for a given location.
