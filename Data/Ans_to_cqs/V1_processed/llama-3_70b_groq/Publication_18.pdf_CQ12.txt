The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context, which mentions CNNs as a specialized type of neural networks capable of extracting spatial patterns from images. The context also discusses the architecture of CNNs, comprising convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Additionally, the context mentions the application of CNNs in image classification and object detection tasks, which further supports the conclusion that a CNN is used in the pipeline.
