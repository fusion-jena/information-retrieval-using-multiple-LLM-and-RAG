The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The context discusses ensemble techniques, XGBoost, and other machine learning models like CNN and RCNN, but it does not delve into the specifics of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
