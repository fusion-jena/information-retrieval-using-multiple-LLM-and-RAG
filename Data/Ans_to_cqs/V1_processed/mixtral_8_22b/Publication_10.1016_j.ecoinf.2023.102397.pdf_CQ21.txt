Based on the given information, there isn't enough detail about the specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, some insights can be derived from the process described in the text. After creating an advanced classifier (i.e., the recognizer), the researchers evaluated its performance by running it on the test set. Then, they applied the same recognizer to the target set to obtain biologically relevant results. This suggests that the main postprocessing steps might involve applying the trained model to new datasets and interpreting the results based on biological relevance. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, I cannot provide further insight into specific techniques such as saliency maps, metrics calculations, or confusion matrices.
