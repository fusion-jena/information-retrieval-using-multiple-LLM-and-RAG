The deep learning models mentioned in the given context are implemented using Keras (<https://keras.io/>). Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python, which can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Therefore, it can be said that TensorFlow is one of the frameworks used to build these deep learning models.
