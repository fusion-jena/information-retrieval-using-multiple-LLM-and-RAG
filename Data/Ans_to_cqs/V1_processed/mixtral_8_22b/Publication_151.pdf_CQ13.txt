In the provided context, there isn't explicit mention of specific hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, some information about hyperparameters can still be extracted from the text.

One important hyperparameter mentioned is the embedding size 'k', which is set to 128 for datasets with 200 taxa and 512 for larger datasets including the real Web-of-Life dataset. Another hyperparameter discussed is the batch size, which is fixed to 32.

Additionally, the authors note that they did not fine-tune the hyperparameters based on any particular dataset but rather chose them based on preselected values due to computational limitations. They also suggest that in practical applications, it would be beneficial to fine-tune all hyperparameters using a validation set.

However, without further context or additional information, I cannot provide exact details regarding other hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model.
