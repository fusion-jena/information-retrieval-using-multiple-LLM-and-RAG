To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, which included various land use and land cover categories such as urban areas, croplands, forests, water bodies, wetlands, tundras, and snow or ice. The diversity in the dataset helped improve the model's ability to classify different types of landscapes accurately. Secondly, cross-validation was performed to evaluate the performance of the model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and then training and testing the model on these subsets iteratively. This process helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model performs well on unseen data. Lastly, stratified splitting was applied when partitioning the dataset into training and validation sets. Stratified splitting maintains the same proportion of samples from each category in both sets, ensuring that the model learns from all categories equally. These measures collectively contributed to improving the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model.

Based on the given information, it appears that the authors took steps to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they did not explicitly mention any specific techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Instead, they focused on discussing the hyperparameters set for each machine learning technique within the Google Earth Engine platform. They also mentioned employing validation data for tuning key hyperparameters to avoid overfitting. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based solely on the provided context, it seems reasonable to infer that some form of cross-validation and possibly stratified sampling may have been utilized due to common practices in machine learning applications.
