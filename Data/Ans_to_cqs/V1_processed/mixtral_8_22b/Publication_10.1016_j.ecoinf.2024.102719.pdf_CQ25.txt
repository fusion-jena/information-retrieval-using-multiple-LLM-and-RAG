The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the deep learning model is being used for prediction purposes related to river health. This could potentially involve tasks such as classification or regression, depending on how river health is defined and measured within the study. For example, the model might classify different sections of rivers into categories like 'healthy','moderately healthy', or 'poorly healthy'. Alternatively, it may use regression to predict specific numerical indicators of river health, such as water quality parameters or biodiversity indices. Without more detailed information about the specific implementation of the deep learning model, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding its exact purpose.
