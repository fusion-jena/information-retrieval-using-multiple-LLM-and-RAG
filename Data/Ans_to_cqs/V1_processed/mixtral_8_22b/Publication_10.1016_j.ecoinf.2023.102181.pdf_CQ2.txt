The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references mentioned, we can infer that the study might involve geospatial or environmental data, such as soil class prediction or marine benthic habitat mapping. This suggests that the data format could include raster images (for representing maps or satellite imagery), vector data (for point locations or polygons), or CSV files containing tabular data related to environmental variables. Without more detailed information, it is difficult to confirm the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
