Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed explanation of the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, generally speaking, postprocessing steps can include creating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy or precision, and generating confusion matrices. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained model and identify areas where it might need improvement. In the case of the Apis-FIS model mentioned in the context, it would depend on how the authors implemented their model using Matlab's fuzzy logic toolbox. They could have included additional steps like visualizing the response surfaces between input variables and outputs, validating the model against ground truth data, or performing sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of different inputs on the final output. Without further details about the specific implementation, it's difficult to provide a more precise answer.
