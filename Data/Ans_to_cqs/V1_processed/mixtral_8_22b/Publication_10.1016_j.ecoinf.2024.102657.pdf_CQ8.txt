The given context does not provide any specific details about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that they used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for their research but doesn't mention anything about the availability of the code repository. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
