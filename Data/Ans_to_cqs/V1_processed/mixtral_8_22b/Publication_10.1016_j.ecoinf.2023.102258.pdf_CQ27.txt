Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models used for bird call classification. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer regarding the exact steps taken for model serialization, platform selection, or any other aspects related to the deployment of these models. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, it is common practice to serialize the model using popular formats such as ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, PyTorch TorchScript, or HDF5. Once serialized, the model can be deployed on various platforms depending on the use case requirements. For instance, edge devices like Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson might be suitable for real-time applications, while cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure could be more appropriate for larger scale processing needs. Again, without further context, this is only speculation and may not reflect the actual practices employed in the BirdVox project.
