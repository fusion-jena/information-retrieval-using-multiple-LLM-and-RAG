The provided context does not contain specific information about handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. However, some general strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping to reduce variability, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These approaches help mitigate the impact of random factors such as initialization weights and data shuffling during training.
