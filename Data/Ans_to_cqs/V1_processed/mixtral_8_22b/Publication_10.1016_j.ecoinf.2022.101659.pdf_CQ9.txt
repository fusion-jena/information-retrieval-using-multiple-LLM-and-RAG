The information provided does not explicitly state where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that all data analysis was conducted using R version 4.0.5, which suggests that the raw data might have been processed using this software. Additionally, the paper cites several sources related to phytoplanktonic production and system respiration in the lagoon of Venice, but none of them seem to provide direct access to the specific dataset used in this study. Therefore, without further information or clarification, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
