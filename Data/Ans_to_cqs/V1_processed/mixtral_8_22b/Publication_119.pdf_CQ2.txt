Based on the given context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the U-Net model implemented within arcgis.learn had a ResNet-50 backbone that was pretrained on ImageNet, indicating that the input data consists of images. Furthermore, the context mentions that the U-Net model produces an overall accuracy of 90.9% when applied to WorldView-3 imagery, confirming that the input data is indeed images. Therefore, we can conclude that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images.
