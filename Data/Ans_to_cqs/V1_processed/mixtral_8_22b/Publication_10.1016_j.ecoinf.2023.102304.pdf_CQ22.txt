The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and feature importance. The overall accuracy measures the absolute accuracy of detection, while the kappa coefficient provides a comprehensive evaluation of the detection accuracy for different indices and parameter sets. User's accuracy refers to the proportion of correctly classified positive instances out of all predicted positives, whereas producer's accuracy represents the proportion of correctly classified positive instances out of all actual positives. Feature importance is determined by assessing the reduction in the Gini impurity or the improvement in accuracy brought by a feature to the branches it is on. In this case, the kappa coefficient was chosen to evaluate the detection accuracy due to its suitability for binary classification systems like 'burned' and 'unburned' values. Additionally, the use of Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms allowed for the computation of feature importance based on the reduction in the Gini impurity and the gain, respectively.
