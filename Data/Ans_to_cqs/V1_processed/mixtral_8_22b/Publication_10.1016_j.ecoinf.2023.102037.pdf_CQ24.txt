The query asks about strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically mentioning the example of a random seed value. However, none of the provided context directly addresses this specific issue. Nevertheless, some general principles related to handling randomness in machine learning pipelines can be discussed.

Randomness is often introduced in various stages of the deep learning pipeline, such as during initialization of weights, shuffling of training data, dropout regularization, etc. To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, one common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value for all these operations. This way, every time the code runs, it will produce the same results, making comparisons between different models or hyperparameters more reliable.

However, setting a fixed random seed might not always be desirable, especially when evaluating the robustness of a model against variations in input data or initial conditions. In such cases, multiple runs with different random seeds could be performed, and the average performance metrics can be reported.

Moreover, techniques like k-fold cross-validation can help mitigate the impact of randomness due to data splitting by ensuring that each subset of data gets used for both training and testing purposes. Similarly, ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds, which can lead to better overall performance and reduce variance caused by randomness.

Unfortunately, without further information regarding the specific context or application, it is difficult to provide a more detailed or tailored response addressing the strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
