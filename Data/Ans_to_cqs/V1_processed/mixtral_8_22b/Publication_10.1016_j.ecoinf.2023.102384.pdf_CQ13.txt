The given context does not provide information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. It primarily focuses on the dataset preparation, including the generation of ground truth data and challenges faced during the process. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
