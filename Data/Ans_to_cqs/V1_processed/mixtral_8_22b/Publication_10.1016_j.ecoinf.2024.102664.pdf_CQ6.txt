Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required depending on the nature of the dataset. While the given context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing techniques used, some common methods include:

1. Normalization or Scaling: Data normalization scales the features so they have similar magnitudes, which helps prevent variables with larger ranges from dominating those with smaller ranges during training. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling, where data is scaled between 0 and 1, and z-score normalization, where data is centered around the mean with a standard deviation of 1.

2. Cleaning: Removing missing or irrelevant data points ensures that only relevant information is fed into the model. Techniques such as imputation (filling missing values based on other available data) or outlier detection and removal can help maintain data quality.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones can sometimes enhance the model's ability to learn patterns. For example, combining multiple related features into one or extracting statistical measures like means, medians, or variances might reveal hidden relationships within the data.

4. Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical form allows the model to handle non-numeric inputs. One popular method is one-hot encoding, which creates binary vectors representing each category.

While these preprocessing steps are commonly employed when preparing datasets for deep learning models, the exact requirements depend on the specific use case and the characteristics of the data being analyzed.
