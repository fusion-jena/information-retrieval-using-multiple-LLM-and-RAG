The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., that have been applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that increasing the number of convolutional layers subject to update might be beneficial in cases where significant differences exist between the target and source domain datasets. This statement suggests that some form of data augmentation might have been considered while designing the deep learning pipeline, although the exact methods remain unclear from the provided context.
