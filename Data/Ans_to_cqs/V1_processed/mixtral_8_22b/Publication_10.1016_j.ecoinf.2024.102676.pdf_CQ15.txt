The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam that are applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of deep learning models for classifying three sympatric otter species. Deep learning models often employ optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc., to update their parameters during training. Without explicit mention in the context, one cannot definitively state which optimization technique was utilized in this particular case.
