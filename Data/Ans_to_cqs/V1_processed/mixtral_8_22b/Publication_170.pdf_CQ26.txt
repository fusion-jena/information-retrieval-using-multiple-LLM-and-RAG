In addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels, before splitting it into training and testing datasets. This ensures that the distribution of classes in the training and testing datasets remains similar to that in the original dataset, thereby reducing any potential bias introduced due to imbalanced classes.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle class imbalance in the dataset. Oversampling involves increasing the instances of minority classes, while undersampling reduces the instances of majority classes. Both methods aim to balance the representation of different classes in the dataset, thus mitigating any potential bias caused by class imbalance.

Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources, ensuring that the dataset represents a wide range of scenarios and conditions. By incorporating diverse data, the risk of overfitting and biased results can be minimized, leading to more robust and generalizable models.

However, it should be noted that these techniques do not guarantee complete elimination of data bias but rather help reduce its impact on the deep learning pipeline. It is essential to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques using appropriate validation strategies and metrics tailored to the specific problem domain.

Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, considering the common practices in machine learning and deep learning, the abovementioned techniques could potentially be utilized to tackle this issue.
