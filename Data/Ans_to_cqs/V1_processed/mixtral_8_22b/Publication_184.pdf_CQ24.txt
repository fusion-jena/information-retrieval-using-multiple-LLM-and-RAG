Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, one strategy often employed to manage randomness in deep learning models is using fixed seeds during development and testing phases. This ensures reproducibility by making sure that the same results can be obtained each time the code runs. Another common approach is to use techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping, which involve splitting the data into multiple subsets and averaging the results across these subsets. These methods help reduce variability caused by random sampling and improve the robustness of the model. Additionally, data augmentation, mentioned in the context, is another technique used to introduce controlled variation into the training data, thereby reducing the impact of randomness.
