A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. This is evident from the mention of CNNs in section 2.2 and their application in processing the data, as described in section 2.4. Specifically, the model is trained for 150 epochs with a batch size of 128, employing dropout regularization and ADAM optimization to minimize cross-entropy loss.
