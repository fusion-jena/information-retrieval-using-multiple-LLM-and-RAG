Based on the given information, it appears that no specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers has been mentioned in the context. Instead, the paper discusses using various statistical models like Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), Generalized Boosting Model (GBM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Lines (MARS) in an ensemble framework to improve predictive accuracy. Therefore, there isn't enough information to determine if any deep learning models have been utilized in the pipeline.
