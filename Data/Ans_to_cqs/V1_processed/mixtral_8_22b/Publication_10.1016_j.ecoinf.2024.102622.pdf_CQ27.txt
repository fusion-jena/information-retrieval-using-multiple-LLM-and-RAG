Based on the given context, there is no direct mention or explanation of the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on research papers related to remote sensing, vegetation indexes, and machine learning algorithms for estimating chlorophyll content and crop coverage. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
