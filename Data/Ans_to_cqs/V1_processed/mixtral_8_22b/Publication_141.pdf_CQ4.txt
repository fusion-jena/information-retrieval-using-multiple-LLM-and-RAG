The text mentions that data augmentation was applied by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. However, it does not specify the exact techniques used for this purpose. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise or filters to images. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization ability of the model.
