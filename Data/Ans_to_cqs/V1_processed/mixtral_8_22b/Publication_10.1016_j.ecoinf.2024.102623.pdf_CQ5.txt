Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention the names of the datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the text that they have employed a multi-species neural network model, which suggests that they might be working with ecological or biological datasets related to species distribution modeling. The authors also discuss addressing issues like class imbalance and sampling bias, which are common challenges when dealing with real-world datasets. Therefore, while the exact names of the datasets cannot be determined based on the provided information, it can be assumed that they are utilizing some form of ecological or biological datasets relevant to their research focus.
