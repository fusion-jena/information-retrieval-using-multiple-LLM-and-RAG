Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any direct information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects related to deep learning in bioacoustics, including challenges like fragmentation and lack of massive corpora of audio examples, solutions like query-time adaptation, and baselines like prototypical systems. However, it does not mention anything specific about the location of the code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
