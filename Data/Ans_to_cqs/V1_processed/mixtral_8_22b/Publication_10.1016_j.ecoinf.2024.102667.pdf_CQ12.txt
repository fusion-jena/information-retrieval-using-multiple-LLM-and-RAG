The papers cited do not provide information about a specific deep learning model used in a pipeline. The first paper discusses the unintended consequences of combating desertification in China, while the second paper presents a global assessment of lagged and cumulative effects of drought on grassland gross primary production. The third paper explores time-lag effects of global vegetation responses to climate change. None of these papers mention using a deep learning model or any other machine learning technique. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline based on this context.
