The paper uses a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) model for satellite image classification. VAE is a generative model that combines ideas from Bayesian inference and deep learning. Unlike traditional autoencoders, VAEs learn a probabilistic representation of the input data, allowing them to generate new samples similar to the original data. This makes VAEs particularly useful for tasks such as anomaly detection, denoising, and data generation. However, it should be noted that while VAEs can be used for classification tasks, they are not typically considered a primary choice for this purpose. Instead, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often preferred due to their superior performance in handling spatial data such as images. Nevertheless, the authors of the paper chose to use a VAE model for their specific application.
