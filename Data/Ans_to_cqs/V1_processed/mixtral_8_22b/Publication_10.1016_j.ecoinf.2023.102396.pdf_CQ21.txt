Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, I can provide some general insights into common postprocessing steps often used in machine learning models. These may include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class.

3. Saliency Maps: In the context of deep learning models, saliency maps are often used to highlight important features in the input data that contribute most to the output prediction.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: After initial training, it might be necessary to adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, batch size, etc., to improve the model's performance further.

5. Model Interpretation: This involves understanding how the model makes its predictions, which can help build trust in the model and identify potential biases.
