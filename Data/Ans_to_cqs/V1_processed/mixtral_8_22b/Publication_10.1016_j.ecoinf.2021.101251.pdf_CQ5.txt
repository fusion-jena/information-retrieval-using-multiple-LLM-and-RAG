Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses the implementation of data collections within the ESS-DIVE project, focusing on the challenges faced during this process. These challenges include ensuring proper citations for datasets, managing authorship for data collections, and dealing with licensing issues related to compiling datasets from various sources. Projects mentioned in the context, such as AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics, contribute to the generation of high-quality, multidisciplinary data packages. However, there is no mention of any specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
