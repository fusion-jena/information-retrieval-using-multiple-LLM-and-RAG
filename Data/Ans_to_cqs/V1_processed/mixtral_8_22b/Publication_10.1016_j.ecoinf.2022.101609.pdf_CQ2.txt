Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, considering that the study focuses on predicting hourly concentrations of pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 using historical highway pollution data, we can assume that the data format used is likely to be structured data, such as CSV files containing numerical values representing the pollutant concentrations over time. Additionally, since the paper mentions carrying out essential data pre-processing steps like data consistency verification, target attribute transformation, feature extraction, data encoding, and data imputation, it further supports the assumption that the data format used is most likely structured data rather than unstructured data like images, audio, or video.
