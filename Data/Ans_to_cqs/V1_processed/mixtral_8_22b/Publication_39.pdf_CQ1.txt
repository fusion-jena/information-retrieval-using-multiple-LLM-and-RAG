The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the Mask R-CNN model is pretrained on the COCO 2017train dataset, while the ResNets are pretrained on the Kinetics-400 dataset. These datasets are publicly available and can be accessed online. Additionally, the authors mention using the AnnotationsActions dataset, which was likely created or collected specifically for this project. Unfortunately, there is no further information regarding how this dataset was obtained or generated. In conclusion, the primary sources of raw data mentioned in the given context are public datasets such as COCO 2017train and Kinetics-400, along with a custom dataset called AnnotationsActions.
