The given context does not provide specific information on the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. However, it mentions a resampling operation implemented using the 'raster' package in R programming language, which is used to transfer values between layers of different origins and with non-matching resolutions into a raster stack of one spatial resolution. This could be considered as a form of data preprocessing rather than data augmentation. Data augmentation typically involves applying transformations to existing data to create new samples, while this process seems more focused on handling and integrating multiple datasets with varying characteristics.
