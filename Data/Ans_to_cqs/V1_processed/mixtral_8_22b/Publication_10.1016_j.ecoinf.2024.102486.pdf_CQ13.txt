The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in a particular deep learning model. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization parameters like weight decay or dropout rate. The learning rate determines how much the weights should be adjusted during training, while the optimizer is the algorithm used to update the weights. Commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. The batch size specifies the number of samples processed before updating the weights, and the number of epochs refers to the number of times the entire dataset is passed through the network during training. Regularization techniques like weight decay and dropout help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the optimization problem or randomly dropping out neurons during training.
