The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, or validation sets. However, typically, the data is divided based on certain criteria to ensure the model's robustness and prevent overfitting. Common practices include splitting the data randomly, stratified sampling, or using temporal splits if the data has a time component. The usual ratios for dividing the data are 60-80% for training, 20-40% for testing, and optionally 10-20% for validation.
