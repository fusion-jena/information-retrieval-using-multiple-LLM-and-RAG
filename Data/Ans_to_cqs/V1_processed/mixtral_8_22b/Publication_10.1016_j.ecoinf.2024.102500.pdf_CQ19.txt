The text does not provide information about which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. It mentions the use of Python libraries such as Lazypredict and possibly Scikit-learn for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not specify whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework was employed. Therefore, I cannot determine which framework was used to build the deep learning model based on the provided context.
