The context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly, stratified sampling, or using time-series splits depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the project. The most commonly used ratio is 80/20 or 70/30 for training and testing datasets respectively, while some portion of the training set can be reserved for validation during the training process. It should also be noted that the choice of splitting method and ratios depends on factors such as the total amount of available data, class imbalance, and computational resources.

Based on the given context, it appears that the researchers focused on addressing issues related to unbalanced training data and improving sampling strategies rather than discussing the specifics of how they divided their data for training, testing, and validation purposes. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this case.
