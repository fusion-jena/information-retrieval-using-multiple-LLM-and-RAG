The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository on platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on this information. It would be best to refer to the original source or contact the authors directly for more details about the data repository location.
