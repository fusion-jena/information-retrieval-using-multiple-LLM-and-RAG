The authors do not explicitly mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, they state that they used their own dataset consisting of 1938 input patch sizes of 256 x 256 pixels, with 388 patches for testing, 1162 for training, and 388 for validation. This distribution represents approximately 20%, 60%, and 20% of the total dataset, respectively. They also mentioned that they experimented with different input patch sizes, but the results did not significantly improve, so they decided to use the current size. Additionally, they employed data augmentation techniques such as rotation, noise, and flip to increase the dataset by six times, making the CNN classification more robust and improving its ability to generalize.
