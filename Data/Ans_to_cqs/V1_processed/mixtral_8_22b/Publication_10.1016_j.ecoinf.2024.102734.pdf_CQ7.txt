The data is split into training and validation sets, maintaining an 80/20% training-validation split for each class. This split is used to evaluate model performance during training. Additionally, a separate test set is created consisting of 500 segments, including 187 possum vocalizations and 313 noise samples. The distribution of target features to non-target features in the test set is representative of the true distribution post-segmentation. Both validation and test dataset performance are reported.
