Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific data format was used for the deep learning pipeline. However, considering that the research focuses on delineating tree crowns and identifying vegetation patterns using satellite imagery, we can infer that the input dataset used in this study is likely in a raster or image format. This assumption is further supported by references to works such as [26] and [27], which discuss semantic segmentation of Brazilian savanna vegetation using high spatial resolution satellite data and U-Net, respectively. Additionally, reference [28] mentions Deep U-Net for satellite image segmentation, indicating that images were indeed used in the deep learning process. Therefore, while not directly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data from satellite sources.
