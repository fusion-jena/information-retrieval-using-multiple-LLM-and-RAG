Based on the provided context, there isn't any direct information about preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, I can provide some general insights into these common preprocessing techniques used in machine learning and deep learning models.

Normalization: Normalizing features helps bring them to a similar scale, which can improve the performance of many algorithms. Common methods include Min-Max scaling, where features are scaled to a range like 0-1, and Z-score normalization, where features are transformed to have zero mean and unit variance.

Scaling: Scaling involves transforming numeric variables so they fall within a certain range. For example, feature scaling can help gradient descent converge more quickly when training neural networks. Techniques include standardization (Z-scores), min-max scaling, and robust scaling.

Cleaning: Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in datasets. Cleaning may involve removing duplicates, handling missing values through imputation or deletion, and dealing with outliers.

These preprocessing steps are crucial for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning and deep learning models. However, it should be noted that the specific preprocessing required depends on the nature of the problem, the type of data, and the chosen algorithm.
