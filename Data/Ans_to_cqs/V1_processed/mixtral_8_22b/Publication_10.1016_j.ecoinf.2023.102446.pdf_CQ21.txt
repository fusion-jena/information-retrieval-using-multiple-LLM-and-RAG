The given context does not provide specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions. They highlight areas in the input data that had the highest impact on the output prediction.

Calculating metrics involves evaluating the performance of the trained model using various evaluation measures like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help assess how well the model performed on unseen data.

Creating confusion matrices is another way to evaluate the performance of the model. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predicted and actual classifications made by the model. It helps identify where the model is making mistakes and what types of errors it is making.

In summary, while the given context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps, commonly employed techniques include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.
