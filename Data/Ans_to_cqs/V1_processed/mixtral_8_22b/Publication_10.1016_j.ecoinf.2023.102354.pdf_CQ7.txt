Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the provided context to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). Typically, datasets are randomly partitioned into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. However, without further details about the dataset and methodology employed in this particular case, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
