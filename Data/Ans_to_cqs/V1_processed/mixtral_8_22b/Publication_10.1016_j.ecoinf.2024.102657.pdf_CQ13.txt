The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the only hyperparameter of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is the value of k, which was fixed as k=4. Additionally, the text states that the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were tuned using the validation set, but no further details are given regarding these parameters.
