To optimize the hyperparameters of the model, a 5-fold cross-validation grid search strategy was implemented within the training dataset for all machine learning models. This strategy uses functionalities inherent in their respective Python packages. The specific hyperparameters and their optimized values for each machine learning model are presented in Table 4. The table includes details about the hyperparameters for Enet, SVM, RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM models. Some examples of hyperparameters include alpha, l1\_ratio, cost (C), gamma, kernel, epsilon, n\_estimators, max\_features, max\_depth, min\_samples\_split, min\_samples\_leaf, colsample\_bytree, min\_child\_weight, subsample, learning\_rate, num\_leaves, feature\_fraction, bagging\_fraction, and bagging\_freq.
