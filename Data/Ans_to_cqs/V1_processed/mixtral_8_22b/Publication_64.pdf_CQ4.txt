The text mentions that during training, standard data augmentation techniques such as shearing, translation, and mirroring were applied to the images. However, rotation and upside-down mirroring were not applied to images tagged as 'habit'. This was likely because rotating or flipping images of landscapes or trees would not make sense. Therefore, the specific data augmentation techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline include shearing, translation, and mirroring, but not rotation or upside-down mirroring for certain types of images.
