Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine what specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of a REST API, OpenAPI Specification, and JSON files for storing assessment results. It also discusses the creation of reports and visualizations but does not provide any details about the hardware resources used during the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context.
