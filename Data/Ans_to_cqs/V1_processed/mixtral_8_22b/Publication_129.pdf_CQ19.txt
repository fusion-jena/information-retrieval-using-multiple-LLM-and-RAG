The deep learning model in this study uses the TensorFlow Object Detection API framework. This framework is built on top of TensorFlow, an open-source software library for machine intelligence. It allows developers to build and train their own custom object detection models. The TensorFlow Object Detection API supports a variety of different models, including popular ones like Faster R-CNN, Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), and RetinaNet. In this case, the authors have chosen to use the TensorFlow Object Detection API to develop their mobile-based crop pest recognition system.
