To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors employed several measures. Firstly, they utilized a diverse dataset, which was likely sourced from high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning, as mentioned in the reference "Fish. Res. 246, 106166." Secondly, they implemented a rigorous cross-validation technique called folded cross-validation. This involved partitioning the dataset into ten equal sections or folds. Each fold served as the test set once, while the remaining nine folds were used for training. This cyclical process allowed them to evaluate the model's performance comprehensively by averaging the results obtained from each fold. Lastly, throughout the experimental phase, they controlled for any external factors that could potentially influence the results, thereby enhancing the precision and reliability of their tests.
