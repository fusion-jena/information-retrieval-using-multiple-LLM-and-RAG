The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer that the authors might have monitored the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., based on the mention of 'test set performances'. Additionally, they could have used techniques like cross-validation or early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal performance. But without specific details mentioned in the provided context, these assumptions remain speculative.
