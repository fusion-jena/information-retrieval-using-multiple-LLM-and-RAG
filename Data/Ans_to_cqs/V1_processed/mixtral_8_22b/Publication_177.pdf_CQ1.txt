The context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers might have used various sources such as publicly available datasets or custom image collections obtained through surveys or sensors. For example, in the case of identifying plant species, they could have gathered images from botanical gardens, forests, or other natural environments using cameras or drones equipped with sensors. Additionally, some studies mentioned in the references section may have employed online resources like Google Images or PlantCLEF datasets for their research purposes.
