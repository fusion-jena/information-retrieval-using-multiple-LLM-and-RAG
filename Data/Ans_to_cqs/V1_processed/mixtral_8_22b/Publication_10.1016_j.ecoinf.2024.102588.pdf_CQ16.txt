The text does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the early stopping option was used, which stops the model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy could not be improved. This suggests that one criterion used to determine when training is complete might be when there is no further improvement in the validation accuracy. Additionally, the learning rate was automatically adjusted to find the optimal point, indicating another possible criterion - reaching the optimal learning rate.
