The text does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions a "classification dendrogram" being generated using the FIT pairwise comparison model for 44 trails from captive Amur tigers. Therefore, it cannot be determined if a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer model was used.
