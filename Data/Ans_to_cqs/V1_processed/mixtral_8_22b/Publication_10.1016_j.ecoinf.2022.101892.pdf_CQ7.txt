The authors used a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) method to ensure that the same subject does not appear in both the training and testing sets simultaneously. This approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can generalize well to new data. Additionally, they mention applying aggressive data augmentation techniques to address potential issues related to overfitting and class imbalance. These techniques include random horizontal flipping of images during training. However, the specific proportions or percentages used for splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
