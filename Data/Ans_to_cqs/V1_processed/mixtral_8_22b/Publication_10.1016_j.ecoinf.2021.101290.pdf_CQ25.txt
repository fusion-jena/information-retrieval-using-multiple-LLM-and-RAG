The papers mentioned do not provide explicit information about the specific purpose of the deep learning models used. However, they do mention some general applications of deep learning. For instance, LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton (2015) discuss the use of deep learning in various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Similarly, Kovalev, Kalinovsky, and Kovalev (2016) compare different deep learning frameworks in terms of speed and accuracy, suggesting their application in various domains.

Moreover, the authors propose an architecture based on modern IT infrastructure to leverage the rapid developments in machine learning, including deep learning. They aim to enable real-time data annotation and analysis, which suggests potential applications in areas like object detection, anomaly detection, or predictive modeling. However, without more specific details about the models used, it is impossible to determine the exact purpose of these deep learning models.
