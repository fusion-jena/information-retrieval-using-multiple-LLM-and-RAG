The authors of the study acknowledge that their dataset is highly unbalanced, which could lead to biased results. To mitigate this issue, they propose several techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), oversampling, or class weights. However, these techniques have not been implemented yet and will be explored in future work. Additionally, the authors mention that they used a 60-20-20 train/validate/test split regime to divide the data randomly into training, validation, and testing sets. They also provide a table showing the class-wise breakdown of the data, highlighting the imbalance between classes. Although the authors do not explicitly state that they use stratified sampling, it can be assumed that they did so based on the information provided about the random split and the class-wise distribution of the data. Overall, while the authors recognize the importance of addressing data bias, they have not fully implemented any specific technique to tackle this issue in their current study.
