In the given context, the authors are discussing their approach to plant classification using deep learning techniques. They mention that they use the ResNet model, which stands for Residual Network, as their deep learning model. ResNet is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically designed to address the issue of vanishing gradients in deep neural networks. It does this by introducing skip connections or shortcut paths, which allow the gradient to be directly backpropagated to earlier layers. The authors further specify that they use ResNet50, which means their model consists of 50 convolutional layers.
