All programs use Python 3 and PyTorch for building and training the networks. The Mask R-CNN model is built around the PyTorch detection model of Mask R-CNN. For the implementation of FGFA, the PyTorch models for the backbone, the RPN, and the head of the implementation of Mask R-CNN model are used. The three ResNet variations are also based on PyTorch detection models. These PyTorch models are chosen due to their flexibility, better adjustment to PyTorch training functions, lack of dependencies, and being well-organized.
