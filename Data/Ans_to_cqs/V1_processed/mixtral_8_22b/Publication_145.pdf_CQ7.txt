Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets for the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of splitting was done since the text mentions a validation dataset and the use of a validation set during training is common practice in machine learning. Typically, datasets are randomly divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. In this case, we cannot provide specific percentages or ratios used for splitting the data due to insufficient information.
