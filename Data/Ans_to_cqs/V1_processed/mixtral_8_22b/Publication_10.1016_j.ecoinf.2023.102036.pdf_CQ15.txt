The text does not explicitly mention the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some information about the parameters that were optimized during model training. These include the learning rate, momentum, SD threshold, and input size. The learning rate and momentum are common hyperparameters found in many optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Therefore, while it cannot be definitively stated which optimization algorithm was used, it can be inferred that one of these methods may have been employed due to the presence of these parameters.
