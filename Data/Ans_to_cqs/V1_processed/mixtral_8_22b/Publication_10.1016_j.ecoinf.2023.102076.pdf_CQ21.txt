The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation is performed based on the use of development and testing sets. These sets are likely used to calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score, which could help determine the performance of the classifiers. Additionally, confusion matrices might also have been employed to visualize the performance of the classifiers. It is important to note that saliency maps are typically associated with image processing tasks rather than text classification tasks like those mentioned in this passage. Therefore, it would be speculative to suggest that they were used here.
