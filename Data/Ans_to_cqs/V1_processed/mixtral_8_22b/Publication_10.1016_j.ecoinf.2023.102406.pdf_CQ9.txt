The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). This information can be found in the first paragraph of the given text, where it mentions that the GBIF is a centralized data repository containing datasets of biodiversity observations. Furthermore, the author has mentioned that they have filtered tree species observed since 1990 in North America with coordinate uncertainty <1000 m from the GBIF database. Therefore, we can conclude that the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available at the GBIF.
