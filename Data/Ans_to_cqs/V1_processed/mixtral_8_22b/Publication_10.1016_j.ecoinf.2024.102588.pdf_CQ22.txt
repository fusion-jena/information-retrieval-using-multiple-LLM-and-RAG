The study uses several evaluation metrics to estimate aquatic ecosystem health indices. These include the Nashâ€“Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS). The NSE measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance and indicates the degree of 1:1 line fitness of the observed versus estimated data plot. It ranges from negative infinity to 1, where the mean observed value is used as a reference. An NSE below zero implies poor estimation performance. The RMSE measures the average difference between predicted and actual values, while PBIAS calculates the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts. These metrics were used to assess the performance of both deep learning models (CNN and CNN with an autoencoder) and conventional machine learning models such as ANN, SVM, RF, and XGBoost for estimating TDI, BMI, and FAI values.
