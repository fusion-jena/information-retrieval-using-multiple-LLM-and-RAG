Based on the given context, it appears that the data was divided into different folds for training and execution purposes. Each network was trained and executed three times, each time with a different random initialization of the trainable parameters and with a different data fold. However, the exact methodology used to create these folds is not explicitly stated in the provided information. It can only be inferred that some form of stratified sampling or k-fold cross-validation may have been employed due to the mention of multiple executions with different initializations and data folds. Furthermore, the concept of early stopping was utilized to prevent overfitting, indicating that the data was likely partitioned into separate training and validation sets. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the specific splitting strategy used, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer regarding the precise criteria employed to divide the data for deep learning model training.
