Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention normalizing all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. They also use weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. The paper focuses on evaluating D-Mask R-CNN for instances of deer in their RGB-D dataset, using metrics like average precision (AP), AP50, and AP75 as defined by the Microsoft COCO dataset.
