The research center utilizes the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python to collect raw data for their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they use this API to retrieve picture data related to forest fire points within their study area. Once collected, this data is saved in CSV format on Google Drive for future analysis. Additionally, the researchers also incorporate high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images into their workflow, which are processed using machine learning techniques to identify fire-damaged areas. These methods allow them to gather comprehensive aboveground biomass data, which is then used to inform various land management and conservation efforts.
