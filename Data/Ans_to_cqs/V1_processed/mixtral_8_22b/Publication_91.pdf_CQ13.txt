The deep learning model used in this study employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The specific hyperparameters mentioned include the use of a batch size of 32 and an initial learning rate of 0.001. Additionally, the learning rate was exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94. However, no information is provided regarding the choice of optimizer or any other potential hyperparameters such as weight initialization, number of layers, etc.
