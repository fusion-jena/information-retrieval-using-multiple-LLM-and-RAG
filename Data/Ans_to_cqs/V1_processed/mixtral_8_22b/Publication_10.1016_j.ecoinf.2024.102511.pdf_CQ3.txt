The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred from the context that some form of data labeling or annotation must have been performed to train the deep learning models mentioned. For example, the paper by Soldevilla et al. (2008) discusses the classification of Rissoâ€™s and Pacific white-sided dolphins using spectral properties of echolocation clicks. This implies that the dataset used for training the model was labeled with the correct species information. Similarly, the development of automated classification routines discussed in the context would also require labeled datasets for training and validation purposes. It should be noted that the choice of data annotation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the type of data available. For instance, object detection tasks might require bounding box annotations while semantic segmentation tasks might need pixel-level labels. Therefore, without more specific details about the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the context, it is difficult to determine the exact data annotation techniques used.
