The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of labeling or categorization has been performed based on the use of target classes such as "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian". These labels suggest that the data might have been classified into these categories during the annotation process. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the annotation methodologies used, it cannot be definitively stated whether techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were implemented.
