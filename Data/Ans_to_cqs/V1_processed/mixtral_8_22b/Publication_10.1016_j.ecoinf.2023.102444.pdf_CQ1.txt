Based on the given context, it appears that the study utilizes bioclimatic variables obtained from global raster layers available through WorldClim v2.1. The specific method for collecting raw data is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the researchers use publicly accessible datasets, specifically those related to climate and environmental factors, which are commonly employed in species distribution modeling (SDM).

In general, deep learning pipelines often rely on various sources of raw data, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys involve gathering information through questionnaires, interviews, or observations, while sensors collect data using devices like cameras, microphones, or other specialized equipment. Public datasets refer to collections of data made available by organizations, governments, or individuals for research purposes. In this case, the study uses bioclimatic variables derived from temperature and precipitation data, which could potentially come from weather stations, satellite imagery, or other meteorological sources.
