The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is primarily for image classification. Both ResNet-50 and Inception-V3 are convolutional neural network models designed for this task. ResNet-50 is known for its use of skip connections, which help improve performance in deeper models, while Inception-V3 includes an auxiliary classifier that acts as a regularizer. Additionally, CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training) is another model mentioned, which also contributes to image classification by mapping images to vectors that represent robust semantic features. These models are used to classify images into different categories based on their learned representations.
