The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of standardization as a technique for preprocessing the data. Standardization is a method of normalization that changes the scale of individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical range while preserving the distance relationships between individual data points. This process is carried out independently for each of the considered features. Standardization is commonly used in most tasks involving statistical analysis and machine learning but is not recommended for data known to be non-normally distributed. In this study, the factors analyzed were normalized using the formula (1), allowing them to have values in a similar range and enabling comparison with each other. While standardization addresses scaling issues, it may not directly tackle data bias or imbalance problems. Other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection mentioned in the query can help mitigate these challenges. Stratified splitting ensures that different subsets of the dataset maintain the same proportions of target classes as the original dataset. Oversampling involves increasing the frequency of minority class examples by duplicating existing instances, whereas undersampling reduces the majority class samples. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that the model generalizes well across various scenarios and populations.
