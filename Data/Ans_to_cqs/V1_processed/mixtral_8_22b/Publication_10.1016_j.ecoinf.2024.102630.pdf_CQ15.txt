Based on the given context, it appears there is no direct mention of any specific optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Instead, the context focuses on the application of the Jenks natural breaks optimization method, which is a statistical technique used for determining the optimal classification by maximizing the variance between classes and minimizing the variance within classes. This method is employed to classify vegetation indices like NDVI and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the use of optimization techniques in a deep learning pipeline.
