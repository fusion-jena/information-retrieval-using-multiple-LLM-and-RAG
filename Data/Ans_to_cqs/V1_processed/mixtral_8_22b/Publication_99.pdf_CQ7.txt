Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, it can be inferred that some form of splitting has taken place due to mentions of evaluating models using a validation set during training. Typically, datasets are divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. Common practices include random sampling or stratified sampling to maintain class balance across splits. Without more specific details, it cannot be determined exactly how the data was split in this case.
