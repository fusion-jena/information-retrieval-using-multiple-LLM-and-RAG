The purpose of the deep learning model in this case is for classification. Specifically, the model is designed to classify whether there exists stratification in the reservoir or not. Stratification refers to the layering of water due to differences in density caused by factors like temperature or salinity. The model takes into account various meteorological conditions as inputs and outputs a categorical binary variable indicating the presence or absence of stratification.
