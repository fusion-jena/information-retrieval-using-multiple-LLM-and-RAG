The provided context does not contain specific details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the context that the researchers used automated signal recognition software for their study. This suggests that they likely monitored the performance of their models using standard practices such as validation metrics or cross-validation techniques. Without more specific information, it cannot be determined exactly what methods were used to monitor the model performance during training.
