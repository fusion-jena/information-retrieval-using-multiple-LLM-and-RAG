The materials and methods section does not provide information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete or any specific details about the machine learning model used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given context. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a minimum validation loss, achieving a maximum accuracy or F1 score, or observing no further improvement in performance metrics over several epochs. These criteria can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset being studied.
