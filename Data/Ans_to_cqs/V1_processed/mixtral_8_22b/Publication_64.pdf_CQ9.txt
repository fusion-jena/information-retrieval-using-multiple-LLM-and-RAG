The text does not provide explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the training dataset used comes from PlantNet, which is available under a Creative-Common Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license. Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of any specific repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
