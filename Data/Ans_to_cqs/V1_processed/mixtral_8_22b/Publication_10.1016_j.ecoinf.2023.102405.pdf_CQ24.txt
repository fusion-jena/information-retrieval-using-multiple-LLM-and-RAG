To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before running any code involving random processes. This ensures reproducibility of results across different runs or machines. Another approach is to use deterministic algorithms instead of stochastic ones where possible. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping can help reduce variance due to random sampling. Regularization methods such as dropout also introduce controlled randomness during training which helps prevent overfitting. Finally, ensemble methods combine multiple models trained on different subsets of data or with varying hyperparameters to improve overall robustness and generalizability.
