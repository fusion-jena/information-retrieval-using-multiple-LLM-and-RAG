The text does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, since the paper mentions that MegaDetector was developed with wildlife camera trapping in mind and is freely available with excellent documentation and support, it is reasonable to assume that the code repository might be found on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. A quick search reveals that the MegaDetector code repository is indeed hosted on GitHub at <https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps>.
