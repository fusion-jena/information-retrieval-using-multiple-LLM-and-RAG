The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: the Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUC-ROC) and the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). The AUC-ROC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes, while the CBI evaluates the goodness of fit of the predicted probabilities against the observed data. In this case, the authors also use the delta in the Akaike Minimum Information Criteria (delta.AICc) to select the best tuning parameters for their model. They consider a model with delta.AICc <2 as credible and the optimal model has a minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc=0). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 'LQP' and a regularization multiplier of 3.5. The mean AUC-ROC stands at 95.5%, while the average CBI index for the validation dataset is 82.6%.
