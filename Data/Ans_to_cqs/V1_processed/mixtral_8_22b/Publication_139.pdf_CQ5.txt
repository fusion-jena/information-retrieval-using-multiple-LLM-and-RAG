The text mentions that well-known pre-trained architectures such as Inception, MobileNet, and Resnet50 have been used successfully for bird classification in soundscape recordings. These networks are typically pre-trained on large image databases such as ImageNet, which contains over one million samples distributed across 1000 classes. However, it also notes that in some cases, CNN architectures with far fewer convolutional layers have proven sufficient, and that pre-training on both ResNet50 and Inception neural networks did not meaningfully improve classification performance in this study. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the ImageNet dataset was likely used for pre-training the models, but the specific dataset used for the actual bird classification task is not explicitly mentioned.
