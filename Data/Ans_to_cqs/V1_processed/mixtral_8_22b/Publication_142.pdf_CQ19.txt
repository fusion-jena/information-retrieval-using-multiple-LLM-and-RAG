The text does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the Pl@ntNet deep learning model. However, popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch could potentially be used for building such models. These frameworks provide tools and libraries to create, train, and deploy deep learning models efficiently. Without explicit information, it cannot be definitively stated which framework was utilized for developing the Pl@ntNet deep learning model.
