Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the research paper "Lake total suspended matter retrieval by wind speed: A machine learning model trained by time-series satellite imagery" by Ashkan Noori et al. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct link to the code repository. However, if you are interested in exploring similar work or related resources, you can search for open-source projects on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket using relevant keywords such as "total suspended matter," "satellite imagery," "wind speed," or "neural networks."
