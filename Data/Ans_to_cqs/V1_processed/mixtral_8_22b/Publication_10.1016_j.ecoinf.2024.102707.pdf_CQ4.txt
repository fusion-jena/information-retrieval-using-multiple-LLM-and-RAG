The authors have mentioned using various data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and brightness adjustment in their deep learning pipeline. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset through random transformations. However, the specific details regarding the extent or degree of each transformation applied during the data augmentation process are not explicitly stated in the given context.

Unhelpful 
I do not know what data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
