The authors did not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they used both Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) methods, which inherently help improve the robustness and generalization of the model. They also fine-tuned specific model parameters like'max_depth','min_samples_leaf', and'max_leaf_nodes' for CART, and'max_depth','min_samples_split','min_samples_leaf', and'max_features' for RFR to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation errors. Additionally, they compared their results with other existing models, further validating the applicability of their approach.
