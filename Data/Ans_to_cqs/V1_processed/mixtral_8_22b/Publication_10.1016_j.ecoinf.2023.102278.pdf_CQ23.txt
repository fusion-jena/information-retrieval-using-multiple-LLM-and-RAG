To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset used for training and validation was diverse, consisting of multiple classes and levels within the TLm dataset. Secondly, the use of pre-trained weights from ImageNet for transfer learning helped improve the model's ability to learn features relevant to the task. Thirdly, the models were trained and validated on the same dataset, ensuring consistency in evaluation metrics. Lastly, the choice of the best model was based on the minimum total loss after nine epochs, preventing overfitting and improving the model's generalizability. Cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques were not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
