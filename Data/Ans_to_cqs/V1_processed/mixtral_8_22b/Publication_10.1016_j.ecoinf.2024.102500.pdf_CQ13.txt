The text does not provide information on the use of a deep learning model. However, it mentions several hyperparameters used in other machine learning models like Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and Gradient Boosting (GB) models.

For the LGBM model, the hyperparameters used include subsamples, min_child_samples, reg_lambda, n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, and random_state. Subsamples help reduce overfitting, while min_child_samples control local pattern sensitivity. Reg_lambda prevents overfitting, and n_estimators determine the number of trees in the ensemble. Learning_rate controls how much each tree contributes to the final output, max_depth limits the depth of each tree, and random_state ensures reproducibility.

Similarly, for the GB model, the hyperparameters used are not explicitly stated but are implied to be similar to those used in the LGBM model. The text also mentions that extensive experimentation was conducted for the Random Forest (RF) model using varying numbers of trees for the optimal fit.

However, no mention is made of any hyperparameters related to a deep learning model, such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, etc. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide the requested information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
