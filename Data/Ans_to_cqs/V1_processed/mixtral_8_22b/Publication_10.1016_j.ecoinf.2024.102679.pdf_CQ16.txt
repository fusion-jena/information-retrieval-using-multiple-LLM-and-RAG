Training completion is determined by selecting the model relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set. This approach is employed to prevent overfitting at each training stage. Additionally, the patch size is set to 1024 x 1024 pixels during inference to expedite the process. Further details regarding the fine-tuning process can be found in section 2.5.2.
