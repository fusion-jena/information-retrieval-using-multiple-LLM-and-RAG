Based on the given context, it appears that the study does not directly involve deep learning pipelines or popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the research focuses on estimating forest biomass density using various datasets and techniques. Specifically, the study employs field-collected data and machine learning methods to develop models for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation. Additionally, the authors utilize a method with low data dependency that combines forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. One specific dataset mentioned in the context is the GIMMS NDVI3g dataset, which was used to downscale forest inventory data from 1989 to 2018, resulting in a 1 km resolution map of forest biomass density in the Qinba Mountains. However, no information is provided regarding the use of any deep learning pipelines or other commonly used datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
