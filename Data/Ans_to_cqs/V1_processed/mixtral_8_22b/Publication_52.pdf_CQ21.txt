The given context does not provide information about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices. However, generally speaking, these are common techniques used in machine learning to evaluate and interpret models.

Saliency maps help visualize the importance of different features in the input data towards the final prediction made by the model. They highlight areas in the input data that contribute significantly to the decision-making process of the model.

Metrics calculation involves computing various performance measures like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to quantify the effectiveness of the trained model. These metrics help compare different models and select the best one for deployment.

Confusion matrices are another useful tool for evaluating classification models. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a classifier in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This allows us to understand the strengths and weaknesses of our model and identify any biases or imbalances in its predictions.
