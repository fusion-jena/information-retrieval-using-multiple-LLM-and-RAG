To monitor the model performance during training, the authors first determined the best image resolution for each evaluated input size. This was done during the training phase. Once the best image resolution was identified, the DDCN processed the testing images using batches composed of the images with the best-evaluated size. This approach allowed the authors to ensure optimal performance of their model during the training process.
