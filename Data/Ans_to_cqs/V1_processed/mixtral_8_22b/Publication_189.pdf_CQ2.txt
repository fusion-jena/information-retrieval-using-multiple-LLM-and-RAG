Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes image data format. The paper "[20] Zhao J., Ren X. (2020)" discusses region of interest extraction based on convolution neural networks for image linear distortion correction. Similarly, the paper "[22] H. Ahamed, I. Alam and M. M. Islam" focuses on HOG-CNN based real time face recognition using image data. Furthermore, the implementation details mention the usage of images with specific dimensions such as [a,640,640,3]. Additionally, the loss values obtained during Mask R-CNN training also indicate the involvement of image data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline predominantly employs image data format. However, without further information, it cannot be determined if other data formats like audio or video are also utilized in the pipeline.
