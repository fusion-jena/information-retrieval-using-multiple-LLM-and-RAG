The research paper does not explicitly mention any specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on the information available, we can infer that the authors used bootstrapping techniques to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the average shortest path length (ASPL) for each hour by device. This could be considered as one way to monitor the model performance during training. Additionally, they also calculated the R2-thresholds for all 24 hours of the day, which might have been used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model. But without explicit details about the monitoring strategy, this remains speculative.
