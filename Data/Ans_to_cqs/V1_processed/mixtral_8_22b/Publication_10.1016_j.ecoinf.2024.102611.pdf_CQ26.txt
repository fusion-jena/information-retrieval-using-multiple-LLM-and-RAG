Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors have addressed potential data bias during the preprocessing stage of their deep learning pipeline through maintaining consistent ratios across groups in the sampling process. This is evident from the information presented in Table 3, which suggests that the distribution of trained, tested, and validated samples is balanced across different groups. By doing so, they aim to prevent any potential bias during classification.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias. These methods could potentially be employed to further mitigate imbalances within the dataset, but without additional information, we cannot confirm whether these techniques were utilized in this particular study.

In conclusion, while the authors do take steps to maintain consistency and balance in their sample distribution across groups, there is no explicit mention of other common techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being applied to address data bias in this case.
