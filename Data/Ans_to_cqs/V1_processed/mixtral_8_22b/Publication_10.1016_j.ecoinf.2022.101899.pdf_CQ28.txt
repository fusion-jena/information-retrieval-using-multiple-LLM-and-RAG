The papers by Halgamuge et al. (2020) and Dowdy (2020) do not provide information about which specific platform or cloud service provider was used to deploy their respective deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether they used platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform based solely on these sources. Further research would be required to find out more details regarding the deployment of these models.
