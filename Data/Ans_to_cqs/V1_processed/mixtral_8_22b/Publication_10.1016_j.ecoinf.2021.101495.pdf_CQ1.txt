The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used various techniques such as manual annotation, automatic segmentation, or publicly available datasets. For instance, they mentioned manually annotating 275 segments and automatically generating 6921 segments with x12 data augmentation, resulting in 14,896 images. Additionally, they referred to using official sources and estimations for validation purposes. Nevertheless, without explicit details on the exact methodologies employed for gathering raw data, one cannot definitively state what methods were utilized.

Based on the given context, we can only infer that the researchers may have used a combination of manual annotation, automatic segmentation, and possibly some form of publicly available datasets to collect their raw data. However, without more specific information, we cannot provide a precise answer to the query.
