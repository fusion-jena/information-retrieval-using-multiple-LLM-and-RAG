The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for image classification tasks. This is evident from the mention of computing top-k accuracy on a test set, which is a common evaluation metric for image classification models. Additionally, the authors discuss comparing their results with an earlier study that relied on human manual classification, further suggesting that the deep learning model is intended for image classification purposes.
