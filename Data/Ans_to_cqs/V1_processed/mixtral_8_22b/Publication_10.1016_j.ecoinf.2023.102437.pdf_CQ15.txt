While the given context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), these are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Optimization techniques play a crucial role in training deep learning models by minimizing the loss function and updating the weights of the model accordingly.

SGD is one of the most popular optimization algorithms due to its simplicity and efficiency. It updates the parameters of the model iteratively using the gradient of the objective function calculated from a single example. This makes SGD computationally efficient but also introduces noise into the parameter updates, which can help escape shallow local minima during training.

On the other hand, Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization techniques: Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and momentum. Adam calculates individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters using the first and second moments of gradients, making it suitable for problems with sparse gradients or noisy data.

Other optimization techniques include RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adadelta, each having its strengths and weaknesses depending on the problem at hand. Ultimately, choosing the right optimization technique depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, computational resources available, and the nature of the problem being solved.
