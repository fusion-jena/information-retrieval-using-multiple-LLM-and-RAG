In this deep learning pipeline, the primary data format used is images. Specifically, the pipeline uses frames extracted from videos. These frames are used to train and test five Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The goal is to classify these frames into one of six environmental condition classes. It's important to note that the potential influence of fish being in the extracted frames was considered negligible. The validation performance of the best CNN model is presented in a confusion matrix. However, there is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in this particular pipeline.
