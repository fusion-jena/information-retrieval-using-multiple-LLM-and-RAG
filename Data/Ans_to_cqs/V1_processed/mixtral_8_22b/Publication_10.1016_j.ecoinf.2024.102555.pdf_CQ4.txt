The given context does not provide specific information on the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve model performance by introducing more variability in the dataset. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the input data.
