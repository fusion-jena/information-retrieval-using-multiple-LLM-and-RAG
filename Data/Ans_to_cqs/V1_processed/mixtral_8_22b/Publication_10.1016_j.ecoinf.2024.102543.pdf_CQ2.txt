Based on the given context, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data format. During the preprocessing phase, techniques such as auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, and filtering are applied to standardize and enrich the dataset. The images are then adjusted to a uniform size of 640 x 640 pixels and contain substantial amounts of annotated data. Additionally, augmentation plays a crucial role in diversifying the dataset by introducing random saturation adjustments to each training example. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
