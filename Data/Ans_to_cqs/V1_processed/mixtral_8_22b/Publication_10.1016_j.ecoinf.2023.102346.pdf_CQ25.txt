Based on the given context, it appears that the study focuses on applying various machine learning techniques to analyze microbiomes and their associated data. However, there isn't explicit information about the use of any specific deep learning models or their purposes within this research.

Machine learning algorithms mentioned include Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). These are applied for habitat suitability predictions.

The paper also mentions testing the prediction power of these machine learning algorithms using several packages such as "sdm," "dismo," "bioclim," and "biomod2." They evaluate model performance based on metrics like AUC, ROC, TSS, KAPPA, and COR values.

However, without more specific details regarding the implementation of deep learning models, it is not possible to definitively state what the purpose of any potential deep learning model would be in this context. It could potentially be used for tasks such as classification, segmentation, or detection, but further clarification is needed to provide a precise answer.
