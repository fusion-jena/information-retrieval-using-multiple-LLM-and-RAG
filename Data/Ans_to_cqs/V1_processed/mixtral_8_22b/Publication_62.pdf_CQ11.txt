The information provided does not include a direct link to a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it mentions that the study focuses on the digitized portion of the United States National Herbarium, which currently consists of 1.2 million specimens. Additionally, there are supplementary materials listed, including notebooks used to define and train the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. These notebooks can be downloaded as Mathematica notebook files or PDF files. Unfortunately, without additional context or information, I cannot provide a direct link to a data repository containing the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this study.
