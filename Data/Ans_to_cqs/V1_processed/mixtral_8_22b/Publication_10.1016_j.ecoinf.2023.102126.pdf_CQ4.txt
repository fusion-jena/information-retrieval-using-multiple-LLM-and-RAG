Based on the given context, there isn't any information about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your query.

However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustments. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and improve model performance by introducing variations in input data.
