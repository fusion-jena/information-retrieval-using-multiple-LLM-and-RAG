The provided context primarily discusses a specific implementation of a deep learning pipeline for plant species identification using images. Therefore, the primary data format used in this case is image data. Specifically, the authors use leaf images to train their model. They employ a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to process these images effectively.

Convolutional Neural Networks are particularly well suited for processing grid-like topology data such as images. In this application, the CNN layers help extract relevant features from the input images. Subsequently, the LSTM layer takes over to analyze temporal dependencies within these features.

While not explicitly mentioned in the given context, other common data formats used in deep learning pipelines include audio files, videos, and structured datasets like CSV or Excel files. Audio files might be used for speech recognition or music genre classification tasks; videos could be employed for action recognition or object tracking purposes; while structured datasets find extensive usage in predictive modeling tasks across various domains including finance, healthcare, and marketing.
