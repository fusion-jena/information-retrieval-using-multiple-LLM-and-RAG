The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the methodology used for training the model, including the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), pre-training with additional acoustic reference data, and fine-tuning with ROI data from the study site. However, it does not mention details regarding the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection.
