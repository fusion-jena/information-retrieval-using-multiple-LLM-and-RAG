The paper does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the National Museum of Costa Rica helped with the collection, identification, and digitization of samples in the Costa Rican leaf-scan dataset. It also acknowledges the iDigBio initiative for providing access to herbarium data. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data used in this study might be accessible through these sources. However, without explicit information about the availability of the data repository, it cannot be confirmed.
