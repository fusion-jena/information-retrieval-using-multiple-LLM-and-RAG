Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about any preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and augmentation. Normalization scales the values to a smaller range, often between 0 and 1, to prevent large values from dominating the algorithm. Scaling rescales the features so that they have the same scale, preventing those with larger ranges from being weighted more heavily during training. Cleaning involves removing or handling missing or inconsistent data points. Data augmentation generates new samples by applying random transformations to existing ones, helping improve the model's ability to generalize.
