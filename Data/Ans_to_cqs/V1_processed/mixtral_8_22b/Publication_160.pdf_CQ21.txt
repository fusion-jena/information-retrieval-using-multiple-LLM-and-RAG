The text does mention one specific post-processing step after model training, which involves selective classification using the SGR algorithm. This process helps to improve the overall performance of the model by allowing it to reject predictions when their reliability falls below a certain threshold. The SGR algorithm provides accurate thresholds based on the required level of error, ensuring that only reliable predictions are accepted.

In addition to this, the text also mentions calculating metrics such as macro-F1, top-1 accuracy, and micro-F1 scores for evaluating the performance of various models. However, these calculations do not necessarily constitute post-processing steps but rather serve as methods for comparing and analyzing the performance of different models during the development phase.

Other common post-processing techniques, such as saliency maps or confusion matrices, are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, while we can confirm that selective classification using the SGR algorithm and metric calculation are employed as post-processing steps, there is no information available regarding other potential techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices.
