The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest potential strategies employed. For instance, the use of Google Earth Engine for planetary-scale geospatial analysis implies access to diverse datasets from various regions around the world. This could contribute to enhancing the model's ability to perform well when applied to new data outside its training set. Additionally, the mention of using XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its robustness against overfitting, suggests that the researchers might have considered techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting during their modeling process. These methods help prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance on unseen data. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the exact steps taken to validate the model, we cannot definitively state what measures were specifically implemented to ensure its generalizability.
