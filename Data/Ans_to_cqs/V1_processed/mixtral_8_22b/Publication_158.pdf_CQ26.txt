The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, there are indications of certain strategies employed to improve model performance and mitigate potential biases.

One technique mentioned is data augmentation, which is applied to enhance sample variation. This includes rotation, reflectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image. These methods help increase the diversity of the dataset and potentially reduce overfitting by introducing variations in the images.

Additionally, early stopping criteria are applied if no improvement is found in 50 epochs. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes better to unseen data. Furthermore, an ensemble of three models is generated, and the average of the final output layer is taken. Using multiple models and averaging their outputs can help reduce variance and improve the robustness of predictions.

Lastly, spatial features are incorporated into a random forest classifier for comparison. Including spatial features may help capture patterns related to location and context, which could contribute to reducing any potential biases introduced by focusing solely on spectral information.
