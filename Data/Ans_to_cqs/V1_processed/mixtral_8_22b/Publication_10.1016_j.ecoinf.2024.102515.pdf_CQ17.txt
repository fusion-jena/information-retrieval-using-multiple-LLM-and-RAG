Based on the given context, there is no specific mention of any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, the context does discuss various steps taken during the data acquisition and processing stages to ensure the quality and relevance of the data used for analysis. These include filtering out irrelevant tweets containing memes, removing inappropriate images, and discarding tweets located more than 20km away from the coastline. While these measures do not directly address overfitting in the machine learning models, they contribute towards improving the overall performance and accuracy of the models by ensuring the use of clean and relevant data.
