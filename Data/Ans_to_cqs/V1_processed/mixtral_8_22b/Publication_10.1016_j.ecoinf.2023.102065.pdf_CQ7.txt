Based on the given context, it appears that the data was split into training and validation sets for the purpose of deep learning model training. However, the specific criteria used to perform this split are not explicitly mentioned. In general, when working with machine learning or deep learning models, data is often divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training dataset is used to fit the model, while the validation dataset is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing dataset is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. It can be assumed that similar principles were applied here, but without further information, it cannot be confirmed what exact criteria were used to divide the data into training and validation sets.
