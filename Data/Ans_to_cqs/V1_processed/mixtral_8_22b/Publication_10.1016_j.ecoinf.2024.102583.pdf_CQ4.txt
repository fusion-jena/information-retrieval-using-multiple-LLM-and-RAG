The text does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translation. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and prevent overfitting by introducing variations in the training data.
