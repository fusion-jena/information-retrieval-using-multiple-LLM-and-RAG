The provided context does not directly address the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out results across multiple runs with different initializations, and employing deterministic algorithms where possible. It should be noted that while these strategies help mitigate the impact of randomness, they do not eliminate it entirely.
