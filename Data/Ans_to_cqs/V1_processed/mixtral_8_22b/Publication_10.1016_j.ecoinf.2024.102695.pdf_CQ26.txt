The text does not provide explicit information about the use of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a learning rate of 0.0001 was used throughout the training process, along with 300 training epochs and 24 data instances processed per batch. Additionally, the dataset was divided chronologically into 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy aims to simulate real-world scenarios and enhance the generalizability of the model. It can be inferred that this division might help mitigate any temporal biases present in the data. Furthermore, the implementation of an early stopping strategy prevents overfitting issues, contributing to addressing potential biases in the model.
