Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model. However, some common preprocessing steps often employed include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the features so they have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the final output by adjusting their values to be within a certain range. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, such as removing them or imputing them based on other available information. Additionally, the context mentions strategies like training data augmentation, post-classification, segmentation, and filtering, which enhance the generalization capabilities and reduce salt-and-pepper errors. It also discusses dealing with the geometry of the training data, excluding outliers, refining training samples, and changing the proportion of training and test data. These strategies collectively improve classification accuracy and enable better modeling of the environment.
