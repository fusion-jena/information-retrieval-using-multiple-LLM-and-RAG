The given context does not provide any direct reference or link to a specific code repository containing a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot directly point out where the code repository of such a deep learning pipeline might be available. However, based on the references mentioned, there are no explicit links to popular version control platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It would be best to search for relevant repositories related to the research papers cited or consult their respective authors for more accurate information.
