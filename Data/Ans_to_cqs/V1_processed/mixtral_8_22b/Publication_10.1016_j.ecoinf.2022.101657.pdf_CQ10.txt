Unfortunately, based on the provided information, there is no explicit mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline discussed in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository containing the relevant code. However, it might still be worthwhile to search online using keywords related to the described methodology, such as "Scaled-YOLOv4," "transfer-learning," and "mAP50" combined with terms like "GitHub," "GitLab," or "BitBucket." This could potentially lead to finding the desired code repository.
