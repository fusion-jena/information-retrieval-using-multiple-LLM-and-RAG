The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study involves image classification using Random Forest, a popular machine learning algorithm. It also states that the images were resampled to harmonize all band data and adjust the classification to a 10m resolution. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the source or type of images, I cannot determine which specific dataset was used in their deep learning pipeline. Commonly used datasets for image classification tasks include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, among others.
