During the training process, the TPEBO-LSTM model systematically records the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values. This monitoring strategy allows for identifying the hyperparameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the calculations. By logging these details, it becomes possible to track the progress of the model and adjust its parameters accordingly to achieve better results.
