Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, implementing cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the text does state that one of the advantages of deep learning is its ability to generalize when using large amounts of representative training data. Additionally, the study uses a custom implementation of the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric and calculates the overall accuracy of the model to evaluate its performance. These steps could potentially contribute to ensuring the robustness and reliability of the model across various datasets. Nonetheless, without further information regarding the composition of the training dataset and the methodology employed for model development, it cannot be definitively stated what measures were specifically taken to guarantee the generalizability of the deep learning model.
