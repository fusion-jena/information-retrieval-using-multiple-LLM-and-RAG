A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. This can be determined by several references throughout the text. For instance, it states, "To overcome these limitations, we split each photograph into 50 Ã— 50 pixel tiles to match the size of the training samples." This implies that they are working with a CNN because this methodology aligns with how CNNs function. Furthermore, it explicitly mentions, "Among the deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly suitable for image analysis due to their ability to extract spatial features," confirming that a CNN is being utilized.
