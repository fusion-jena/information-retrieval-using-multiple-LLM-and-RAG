The authors of the paper employ several strategies to mitigate data bias during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. They utilize stratified sampling when dividing the dataset into training and test sets, ensuring that both subsets maintain similar distributions of target variables. This method helps prevent any potential skewing of results due to uneven distribution of classes. Additionally, they mention the use of a diverse data collection strategy, where they gather data from two distinct environments with significantly different soundscapes. By doing so, they aim to reduce the risk of overfitting to specific features present only in one environment. However, there is no explicit mention of oversampling or undersampling techniques being applied in this study. Instead, they acknowledge the presence of imbalanced classes, particularly the overrepresentation of ambient frames, and attribute some variability in their results to this issue.
