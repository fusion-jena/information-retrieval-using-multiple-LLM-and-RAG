The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy or precision, and creating a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the classifier. These steps would help evaluate the effectiveness of the trained models and identify areas for improvement. It is also important to note that the authors have made their Mathematica notebooks available as supplementary materials, which may contain additional details about the postprocessing steps they took. Without access to those notebooks, it is difficult to provide a more definitive answer.
