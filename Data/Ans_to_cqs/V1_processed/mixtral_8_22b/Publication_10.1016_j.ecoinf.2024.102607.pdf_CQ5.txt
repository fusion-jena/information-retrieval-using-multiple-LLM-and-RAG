Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses several datasets related to remote sensing (RS) technology and land use/land cover (LULC) classification mapping. These include MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel, CNLUCC, CLCD, Globeland30, FROM\_GLC30, ESA-CCI\_LC, MCD12Q1, and ESRI\_Land\_Cover\_2020. It also mentions the application of Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, sentinel imagery, and neural networks for crop mapping in Canada. However, without further information, I cannot provide a more detailed response about the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
