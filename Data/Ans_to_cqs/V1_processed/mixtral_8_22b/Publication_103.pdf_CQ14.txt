Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine exactly how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, common methods for optimizing hyperparameters include techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, or even manual tuning. These methods involve selecting different combinations of hyperparameters and evaluating their performance on a validation set to find the best combination. Without further details about the specific process followed during this study, it cannot be definitively stated which method was employed here.
