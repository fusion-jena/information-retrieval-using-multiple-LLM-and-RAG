The given context does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for fire risk mapping. However, common metrics used to assess the performance of machine learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC), among others. These metrics help quantify how well the model is able to predict or classify instances correctly. In the case of fire risk mapping, it would depend on the specific task and objectives of the study.

The context mentions that employing various modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression can contribute to refining fire risk maps. This suggests that some form of machine learning or statistical analysis may have been applied to create the fire risk maps. However, without more details about the specific methods used, it is difficult to determine which evaluation metrics were employed.
