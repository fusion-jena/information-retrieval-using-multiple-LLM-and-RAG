The pipeline uses three types of deep learning models: U-Net, DeepLabv3+, and Pspnet. All these models are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). U-Net is an architecture that was developed specifically for biomedical image segmentation tasks. It has an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections between them. DeepLabv3+ is another CNN architecture that also uses an encoder-decoder structure but with additional features such as Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and depthwise separable convolutions. Pspnet is yet another CNN architecture that uses a spatial pyramid pooling module to capture multi-scale contextual information.
