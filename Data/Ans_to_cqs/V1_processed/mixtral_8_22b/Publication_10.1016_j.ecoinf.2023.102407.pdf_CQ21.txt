After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate and analyze the performance of the models. Based on the given context, some possible postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS), comparing performances of different Species Distribution Models (SDMs), and creating ensembles of multiple models.

To calculate the AUC and TSS metrics, one could use packages like Elapid (Anderson, 2023) or other suitable modeling tools. These metrics help objectively compare the performance of various SDMs, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Self-Distilled Pseudo-Label Ensemble Learning (SDP-EPL).

Additionally, the context mentions the creation of an ensemble teacher model by combining ANN, RF, GBM, XGB, and LGBM models, along with a student model using ANNs. This implies that another potential postprocessing step involves building ensembles of multiple models to improve overall prediction accuracy.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques for visualizing model outputs, such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Nevertheless, these methods could still be employed as part of the postprocessing analysis to gain further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of individual models or ensembles.
