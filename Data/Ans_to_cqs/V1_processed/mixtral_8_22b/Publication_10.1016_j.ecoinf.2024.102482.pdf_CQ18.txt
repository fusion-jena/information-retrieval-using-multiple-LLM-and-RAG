The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves extracting features from the training dataset using a feature extraction algorithm. Once the features are extracted, they are used to train the model. After the training phase, the trained model is then utilized to predict water conditions and assess its performance using a separate test dataset that wasn't involved in the training stage. This approach allows for evaluating the effectiveness of the model in accurately classifying different water conditions. Additionally, the authors mention employing several performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1 score to further gauge the model's efficiency.
