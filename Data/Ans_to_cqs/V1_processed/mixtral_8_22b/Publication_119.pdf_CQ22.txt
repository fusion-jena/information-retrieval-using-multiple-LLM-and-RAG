The performance of the deep learning model, specifically the DNN model mentioned in the given context, is evaluated using two main metrics: overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient.

The overall accuracy metric measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of instances. It can be calculated by dividing the sum of true positives and true negatives by the total number of instances. This metric provides a simple and intuitive measure of how well the model performs across all classes.

On the other hand, the Kappa coefficient is a more robust metric that takes into account the agreement between predicted and actual labels due to chance alone. It ranges from -1 to +1, where +1 indicates perfect agreement, 0 represents no better than random agreement, and negative values indicate disagreement. The Kappa coefficient is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets or multi-class classification problems, as it provides a more reliable assessment of the model's performance.

In addition to these metrics, the context also mentions the use of a confusion/error matrix for evaluating the model's performance. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the prediction results by comparing them against the actual values. It allows for the calculation of various metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, etc., which provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases (precision), its sensitivity towards detecting positive cases (recall), and a balance between precision and recall (F1 score). However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of these specific metrics for evaluating the DNN model.
