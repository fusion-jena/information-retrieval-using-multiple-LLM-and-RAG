The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the final settings restricted the non-linearity enough to make the models fit on random-CV features resemble the results from Bayesian and MLE logistic regression. This suggests that some form of optimization was performed to find these final settings. Unfortunately, without further details, we cannot determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was used for hyperparameter optimization.
