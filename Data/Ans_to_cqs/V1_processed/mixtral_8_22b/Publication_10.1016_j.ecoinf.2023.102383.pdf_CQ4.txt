The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Data augmentation techniques are often employed in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of training datasets and improve the robustness of models. These techniques involve applying transformations to existing images to create new ones. However, without explicit information on this topic in the provided context, I cannot provide a detailed response regarding the application of data augmentation techniques in the mentioned deep learning pipeline.
