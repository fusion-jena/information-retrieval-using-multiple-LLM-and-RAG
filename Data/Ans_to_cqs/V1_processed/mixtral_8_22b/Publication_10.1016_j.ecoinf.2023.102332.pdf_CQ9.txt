The information about the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it does mention that the baroni word2vec model used in the pipeline was trained from a 2.8-billion-word corpus, which includes the ukWaC corpus, Wikipedia, and the British National Corpus. Unfortunately, without more specific details, it is impossible to determine where this particular deep learning pipeline might have been made publicly available, if at all. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
