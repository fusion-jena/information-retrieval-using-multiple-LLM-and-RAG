The paper does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data imbalance or bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into strata or subgroups and then drawing samples from each stratum to ensure that all groups are represented proportionately. This technique helps maintain the original distribution of classes in the dataset.

Oversampling is a method where synthetic examples are created from the minority class to balance the dataset. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one such popular oversampling technique.

Undersampling is another technique used to deal with imbalanced datasets. Here, instances from the majority class are removed until both classes are balanced. Random under-sampling and Tomek links are commonly used undersampling techniques.

Collecting diverse data is also crucial to avoid bias in the model. Ensuring diversity in the dataset can help improve the performance of the model and reduce overfitting.

These techniques can be applied individually or combined depending upon the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the project.
