To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included various types of seagrass meadows and species. This helped in capturing the variability present in real-world scenarios and improved the robustness of the model. Secondly, cross-validation was employed to evaluate the performance of the model. Specifically, repeated cross-validations with 10 folds and 10 repetitions were performed for the seagrass meadow models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions were used for species meadow models. Cross-validation is a powerful technique that helps prevent overfitting and provides a more accurate estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data. Lastly, stratified splitting was not explicitly mentioned; however, it can be assumed that the dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets in such a way that each set contained a representative sample of all classes. This ensures that the model learns from a balanced distribution of classes and improves its ability to generalize to new data. Overall, these measures contribute to enhancing the reliability and applicability of the deep learning model in practical settings.
