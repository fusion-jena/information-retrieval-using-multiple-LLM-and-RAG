The text does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, typically, the data is randomly divided into these subsets. For instance, a common practice is to allocate around 70% of the data for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data while also providing separate datasets for evaluating its performance and tuning hyperparameters.
