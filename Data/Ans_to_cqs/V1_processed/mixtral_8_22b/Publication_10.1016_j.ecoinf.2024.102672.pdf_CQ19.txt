The data analysis was performed using open source libraries and frameworks for the Python 3 programming language. Among these libraries, Keras version 2.12.0 was used. Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python, running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was built using either TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano as the underlying framework. However, the specific framework used is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
