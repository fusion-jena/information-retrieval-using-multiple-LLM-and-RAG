The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation technique used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it is implied that they used some form of object detection annotation since they mentioned training the YOLOv5 model family, which is commonly used for object detection tasks. Furthermore, Figure 1 shows examples of images with annotations of alates using the polygon tool in the labeling section of the cloud-based Roboflow environment. This suggests that they might have used polygon annotation, which is a type of instance segmentation where each object is outlined with a polygonal shape. Therefore, it can be inferred that they likely used either bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, specifically polygon annotation, in their deep learning pipeline.
