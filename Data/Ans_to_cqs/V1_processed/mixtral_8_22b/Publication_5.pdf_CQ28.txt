The text does not provide explicit information about the specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source platform for deep learning, was used to develop the species richness estimation model. This implies that the development and possibly deployment could have been done locally without relying on any major cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Without further context, it cannot be definitively stated which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
