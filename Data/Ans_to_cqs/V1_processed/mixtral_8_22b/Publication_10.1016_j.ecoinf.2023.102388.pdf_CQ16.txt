The provided context does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. It should be noted that these criteria may vary depending on the specific learning algorithm and task requirements.
