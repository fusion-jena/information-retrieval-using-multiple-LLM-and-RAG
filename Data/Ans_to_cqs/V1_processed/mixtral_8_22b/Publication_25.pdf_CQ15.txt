The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some indications of optimization strategies employed.

For instance, the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 classification backbone suggests transfer learning, a technique that leverages knowledge gained from solving one problem to solve another related problem. This can help optimize the learning process by reducing the amount of training needed.

Additionally, the mention of self-supervised learning indicates another optimization strategy. Self-supervised learning involves generating training data using unsupervised methods, which can then be used to train supervised models. This approach can help overcome limitations in labeled data, thereby optimizing the learning process.

Lastly, the choice of RetinaNet as the object detection framework also implies optimization considerations. RetinaNet combines object detection and classification into a single network, allowing for faster training and reduced sensitivity to the number of box proposals among images.
