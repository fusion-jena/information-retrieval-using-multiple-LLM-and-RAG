The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the recordings were analyzed using a previously developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by Nolan et al. (2022). This suggests that the model had already been deployed before being applied to analyze the recordings. Furthermore, the mention of using the same model across different years implies that the model might have been serialized and saved for later use. Nevertheless, without specific details regarding platform selection or model serialization, we cannot definitively state what exact steps were taken to deploy the trained deep learning model.
