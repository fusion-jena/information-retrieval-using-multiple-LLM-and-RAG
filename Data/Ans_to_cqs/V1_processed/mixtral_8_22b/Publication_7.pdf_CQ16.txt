Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during training. When these metrics reach a plateau or stop improving significantly, it can be considered as an indication that further training may not yield substantial improvements. In the context of the provided information, one could infer that similar criteria might have been employed, but without concrete evidence, it remains speculative.
