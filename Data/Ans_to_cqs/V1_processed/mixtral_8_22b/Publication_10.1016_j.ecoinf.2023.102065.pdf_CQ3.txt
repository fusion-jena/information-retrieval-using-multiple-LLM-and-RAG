The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using well-labeled training and validation data from the study domain, which suggests some form of labeling or annotation was applied to these datasets. Additionally, the authors discuss using larger labeled data from outside the study domain, implying that this external dataset also underwent some sort of labeling process. The paper further references the use of weakly-labeled audio data in recent BirdCLEF competitions, indicating another potential method of data annotation. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it is impossible to determine precisely what type of data annotation techniques were employed in their deep learning pipeline.
