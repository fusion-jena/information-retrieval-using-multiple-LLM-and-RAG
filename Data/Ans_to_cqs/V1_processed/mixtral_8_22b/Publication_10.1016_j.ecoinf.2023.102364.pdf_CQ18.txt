Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using various figures, tables, and diagnostics. Specifically, Figure 4 shows the predicted Relative Index of Occurrence (RIO) for Short-billed Gulls based on a machine learning ensemble. This suggests that the model was trained using a combination of different algorithms to improve its accuracy. Additionally, Table 3 provides the model diagnostics importance rank of predictors from the machine learning model, which indicates the significance of each variable used in the model. Furthermore, Figures 6 through 9 display partial dependence plots of the first three top-ranked predictors and a 3D partial dependence plot of the top-ranked continuous predictor. These visualizations help evaluate how changes in these variables affect the model output. Overall, these tools provide insight into the model's performance during training and allow for adjustments to be made if necessary.
