The text mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used in the pipeline for bird species classification. Specifically, it discusses different architectures of deep convolutional neural networks such as MobileNetv2 and ResNet. It also refers to CNN-XC models, where XC likely stands for xeno-canto, a website for sharing bird sounds. Additionally, there are references to papers discussing the use of CNNs for bioacoustic classification and bird species identification. Therefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that the pipeline uses CNNs as its deep learning model.
