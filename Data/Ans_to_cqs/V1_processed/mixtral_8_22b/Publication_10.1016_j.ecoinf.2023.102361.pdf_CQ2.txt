Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what type of data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the paper discusses image classification models and mentions techniques such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, etc., it can be inferred that the data format used in this case is likely to be images. These models are popularly known for their use in computer vision tasks involving image recognition and classification. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is most probably images.
