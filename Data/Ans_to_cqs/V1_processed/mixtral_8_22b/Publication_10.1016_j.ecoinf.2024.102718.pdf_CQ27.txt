Unfortunately, there isn't explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model in the given context. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training the model, it would typically be saved or serialized into a format suitable for use in other environments. This could include saving the model weights, architecture, and any additional metadata required to recreate the model. Common formats used for this purpose might include HDF5, pickle files, or specific framework-dependent formats like TensorFlow SavedModel or PyTorch checkpoints.

Once the model is saved, it can be deployed onto a platform appropriate for the intended application. For instance, if the goal is to create a web service around the model, platforms like Flask or Django could be used to build a REST API. Alternatively, if the aim is to integrate the model into an existing system, the model could be loaded directly into that system. In some cases, specialized hardware may also be used for deployment, such as edge devices or dedicated AI accelerators.

However, without further details regarding the specific project requirements and constraints, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer about which approach would be most suitable for deploying the trained deep learning model described in the context.
