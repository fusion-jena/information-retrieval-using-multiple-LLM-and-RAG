The paper does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data used in this research includes NDVI datasets generated from AVHRR sensors by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS). Additionally, the authors reference other studies that use various methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets for collecting raw data. For example, Chapungu et al. (2020) estimate biomass of savanna grasslands as a proxy of carbon stock using multispectral remote sensing, while Chen et al. (2005) analyze spatial and temporal variation of phenological growing season and climate change impacts in temperate eastern China using satellite imagery. Therefore, it can be inferred that the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline may vary depending on the specific application and available resources.
