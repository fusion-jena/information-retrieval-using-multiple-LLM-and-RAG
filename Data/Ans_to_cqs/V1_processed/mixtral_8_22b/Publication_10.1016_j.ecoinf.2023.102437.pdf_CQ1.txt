Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention any specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot directly provide an answer based solely on the provided context. However, generally speaking, various methods are commonly employed for gathering raw data in deep learning pipelines. These include but are not limited to:

1. Surveys: Data collection via surveys involves gathering information by asking individuals questions about certain topics. This method is often used in social sciences, market research, and user experience studies.

2. Sensors: Sensor data collection involves utilizing devices equipped with sensors to measure physical quantities like temperature, humidity, pressure, etc. Examples of sensor data sources include IoT devices, wearable technology, and environmental monitoring systems.

3. Public Datasets: Utilizing publicly available datasets is another common approach for obtaining raw data. Many organizations and institutions share large amounts of data online, covering diverse domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. Some popular examples of public datasets include ImageNet, MNIST, and UCI Machine Learning Repository.
