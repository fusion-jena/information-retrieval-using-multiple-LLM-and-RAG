The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, none of the provided sources directly discuss this topic. Therefore, based solely on these sources, it is not possible to provide a specific strategy for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to random seed values.

However, generally speaking, there are several common strategies used to manage randomness in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. These include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation techniques, employing ensemble methods, and utilizing regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. Setting fixed seeds ensures consistent results across different runs of the same model, while cross-validation helps prevent overfitting by training and testing the model on different subsets of data. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance and reduce variance, while regularization techniques help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model during training.
