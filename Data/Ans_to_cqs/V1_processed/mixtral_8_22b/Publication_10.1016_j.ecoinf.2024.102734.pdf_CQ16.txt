Based on the given information, it appears that the training process is evaluated based on the test accuracy rather than specific criteria such as validation loss plateau. In Figure 9, the performance of different methods is demonstrated during the first epoch of training. It shows that active learning using low-certainty sampling achieves 90% test accuracy using only 20 training samples, while random sampling requires 80 samples to achieve the same level of accuracy. However, there is no mention of any specific criteria used to determine when training should stop. Therefore, it seems that the completion of training may depend on factors like achieving desired accuracy levels or reaching a satisfactory number of iterations.
