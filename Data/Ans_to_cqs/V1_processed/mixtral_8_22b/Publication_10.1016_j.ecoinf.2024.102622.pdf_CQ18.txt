Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does provide some insights into how the models were evaluated after training using various metrics such as R2, RMSE, and REP. It also mentions that the Random Forest (RF) model was found to have the highest accuracy among other models like Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). But again, these evaluations seem to have been done post-training rather than monitoring the performance during training.
