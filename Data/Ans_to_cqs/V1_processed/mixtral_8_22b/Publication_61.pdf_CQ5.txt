In the given context, there is no explicit mention of using popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the paper focuses on building their custom dataset for cactus recognition in aerial images. This dataset was created specifically for the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley region in Mexico, covering an area of 10,000 square kilometers. To improve the accuracy of the deep learning model, they considered expanding the dataset by including more examples under different conditions, such as varying daylight conditions or different seasons. Additionally, they explored the use of data augmentation techniques, comparing the accuracy of the network with and without vertical/horizontal flipping of the input patches.
