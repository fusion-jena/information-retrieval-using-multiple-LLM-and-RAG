The text does not provide explicit details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the architecture of the network used follows GoogleNet's with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. It also states that once they had a list of cropped thumbnails and their labels, they were sent to their network. Additionally, the text discusses the adaptation of certain parameters such as the size of the strides and the first convolutions adapted to the size of their thumbnails, allowing them to achieve better results than a classic architecture. Unfortunately, there is no mention of specific steps taken during the deployment stage, like model serialization or platform selection.
