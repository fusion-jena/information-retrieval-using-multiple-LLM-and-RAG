In the given context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture specifically designed to handle long sequences and capture long-term dependencies in data. It addresses some of the limitations of traditional RNNs when dealing with long sequences. This model is applied in various fields, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting. In the case of the provided context, the LSTM model is utilized for forecasting ENSO (El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation).
