A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. The baseline model comprises a simple CNN architecture consisting of two convolutional layers with eight filters of size 16x16, followed by max pooling, a flattening operation, and two fully connected layers. The model takes a spectrogram input and produces a probability for each of the 22 species. Additionally, a multi-branch CNN was investigated as an approach to incorporate additional information into the deep learning classifier while maintaining model simplicity.
