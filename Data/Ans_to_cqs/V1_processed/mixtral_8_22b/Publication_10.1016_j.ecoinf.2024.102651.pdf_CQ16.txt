Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include a validation loss plateau, where the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating overfitting; a maximum number of epochs, where training is stopped after a certain number of iterations through the entire dataset; or early stopping, where training is stopped if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs.
