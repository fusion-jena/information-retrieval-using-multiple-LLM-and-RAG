Based on the given context, there is no information about the use or purpose of any deep learning models. The text discusses the results of a FAIR assessment of datasets selected by the F-UJI tool, which was performed using 16 metrics established in the FAIRsFAIR project. The results were then analyzed using a computational notebook report, resulting in visualizations of the summaries of each FAIR principle for all eight repositories. The report also included a section that created a histogram plot of the results, including visualizations of each principle and the overall FAIR score. Additionally, the text mentions that the F-UJI tool is an open-source tool that can be used to evaluate a large number of datasets, but there is no mention of any deep learning models being used in this process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the purpose of a deep learning model.
