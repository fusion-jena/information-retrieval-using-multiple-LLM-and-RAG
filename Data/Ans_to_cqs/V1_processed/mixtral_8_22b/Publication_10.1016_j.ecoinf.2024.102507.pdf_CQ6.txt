Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the dataset. These steps could include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Scaling refers to adjusting the range of values in the dataset, such as min-max scaling or logarithmic scaling. Cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, or missing values from the dataset. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying transformations like rotation, zooming, or shifting to existing images. In this case, the authors utilized data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels to achieve optimal simulation results (72band\_256\_16bit\_split).
