The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for species identification based on audio recordings. This is evident from the description of the Automated Remote Biodiversity Monitoring Network (Arbimon), where it is mentioned that the platform uses a combination of hardware and software for automating data acquisition, data management, and species identification based on audio recordings. Furthermore, it is specified that a random forest model, which is a type of deep learning model, is used for this purpose. Therefore, it can be deduced that the primary function of this deep learning model is classification, specifically identifying the presence or absence of specific bird vocalizations in the audio recordings.
