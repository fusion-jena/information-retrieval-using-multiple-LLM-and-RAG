The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it discusses the optimization of parameters for the Landscape Temporal Response (LTR) algorithm, which is used to analyze landscape responses to disturbances such as wildfires. The authors use Maximum Segments (MS) and Recovery Threshold (RT) as key parameters for their analysis. They also evaluate the accuracy of their approach using metrics like overall accuracy and Kappa. While these details do not directly address the query about splitting data for deep learning models, they suggest that similar principles could apply when determining how to partition datasets for training, testing, and validation purposes. For instance, one might consider factors such as the complexity of the dataset, desired model performance, and potential sources of noise or bias when deciding on appropriate splits.
