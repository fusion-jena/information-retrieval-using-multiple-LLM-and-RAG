The context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses various approaches used in deep learning for tasks like plant disease detection and classification. For instance, the BEiT (12 M) model is mentioned as achieving high accuracy and minimal loss in classifying leaf diseases. Additionally, other studies have proposed different methods, including optimizing hyperparameters using the crossover-boosted artificial hummingbird algorithm or employing deep learning-based segmentation with bitwise logical operations. While these strategies do not address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques in agriculture. To manage randomness in deep learning pipelines, common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation techniques, and applying ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by random initialization.
