Based on the provided context, it appears that there are no specific details about the use of a particular deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, in the pipeline for water quality management. However, one of the cited papers mentions applications of deep learning in water quality management, which suggests that some form of deep learning may be involved in the process. Without more specific information, it is not possible to determine exactly what type of deep learning model is being used.
