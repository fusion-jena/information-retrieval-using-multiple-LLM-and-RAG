To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, the model was trained on the diverse ImageNet dataset (Deng et al., 2009) and subsequently fine-tuned on two separate datasets, namely PAD Full and PAD Lite. This approach allowed for the model to learn from a wide range of image categories and adapt its knowledge to more specific tasks. Secondly, to address the issue of subjects appearing across multiple age groups, a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) method was employed (Han et al., 2014; Pan et al., 2018). This ensured that the same individual did not occur simultaneously in both the training and testing sets, thereby preventing any potential bias or overfitting due to repeated exposure to certain subjects. Lastly, aggressive data augmentation techniques were utilized to counteract overfitting and class imbalance problems. These included random horizontal flipping and alterations to lighting and angle during image capture. By diversifying the input data through these methods, the robustness and applicability of the model could be improved significantly.
