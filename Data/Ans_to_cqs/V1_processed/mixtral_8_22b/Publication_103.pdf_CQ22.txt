The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: top-1 and top-5 accuracies. These metrics measure how well the model can correctly identify the correct species or classes among the given options. Top-1 accuracy refers to the percentage of cases where the model accurately predicts the exact species or class, while top-5 accuracy considers the prediction successful if the actual species or class appears within the top five predicted labels. In this study, the top-1 and top-5 accuracies were computed for both Herbarium255 and Herbarium1K datasets to assess the feasibility of using a deep learning system for herbarium specimen identification.
