The code repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it does mention that the CNN was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages, which are both open source libraries available on GitHub. Additionally, it mentions that a Keras implementation of EfficientNet--B4 called EfficientNet V1.1.0 was used, and its pre-trained weights were obtained through an API. Therefore, one possible code repository link for the deep learning pipeline could be <https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet>, where the EfficientNet V1.1.0 implementation can be found.
