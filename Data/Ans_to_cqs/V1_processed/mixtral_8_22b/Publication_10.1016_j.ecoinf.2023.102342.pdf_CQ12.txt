Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the operational workflow or data mining process. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which type of deep learning model is employed in the pipeline.
