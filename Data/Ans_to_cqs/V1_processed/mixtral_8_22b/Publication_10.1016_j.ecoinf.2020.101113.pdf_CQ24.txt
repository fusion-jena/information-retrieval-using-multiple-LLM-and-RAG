Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. However, some common strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing ensemble methods, and utilizing techniques like cross-validation. Setting a fixed seed ensures consistent results during different runs of the same code, while ensemble methods combine predictions from various models trained with different initializations to achieve better generalization. Cross-validation helps assess the model's performance more accurately by averaging scores obtained from multiple train/test splits.
