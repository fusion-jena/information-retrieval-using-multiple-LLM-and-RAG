The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the model is designed for real-time species recognition. This is supported by the statement mentioning a 17.65% increase in FPS (frames per second), which is crucial for real-time applications. Additionally, the model aims to balance efficiency with performance, suggesting that it may also focus on optimizing resource usage without compromising accuracy. Furthermore, references to other papers indicate that similar models have been used for tasks such as plant disease classification, wild animal detection, and wildlife conservation, implying that the discussed model might serve a related purpose. However, without explicit confirmation, one cannot definitively determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model.
