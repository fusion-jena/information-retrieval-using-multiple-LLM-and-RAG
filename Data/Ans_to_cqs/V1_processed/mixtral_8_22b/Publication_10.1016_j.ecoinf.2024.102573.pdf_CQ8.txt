Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions several details about the experiment, such as the hardware specifications, software packages used, and the duration of the training process. However, it does not provide any explicit reference or link to the code repository itself. Therefore, I cannot accurately state where the code repository is located.
