The purpose of the deep learning model described in this context is not explicitly stated. However, considering the structure of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network mentioned, we can infer that its primary use might be for pattern recognition or classification tasks. This is because the MLP network has an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, with each layer containing neurons operating on non-linear activation functions like sigmoid. Additionally, the table shows that the output layer provides pattern classification, further supporting the idea that the model could be used for classification purposes.
