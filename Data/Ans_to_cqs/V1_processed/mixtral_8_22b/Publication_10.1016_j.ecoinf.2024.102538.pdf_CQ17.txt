In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization being employed to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that a form of regularization has been applied through the use of weight decay, also known as L2 regularization. This can be seen where the text mentions "with a weight decay of 1 Ã— 10". Weight decay is a technique used during optimization to penalize weights with large magnitudes, which helps prevent overfitting by keeping the weights small and thus the model simpler. Additionally, the learning rate schedule mentioned in the context, where the learning rate is decreased when the validation loss remains constant for several epochs, could also be considered a form of implicit regularization. By gradually reducing the learning rate, the model becomes less likely to overshoot optimal solutions and converges more smoothly, potentially avoiding overfitting.
