The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the authors utilized a custom dataset consisting of around 7362 labeled images of dams and non-dams. They employed transfer learning by initializing an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model, which suggests that the original dataset used for pretraining the ResNet34 model was ImageNet.

In summary, while the exact dataset used for training the deep learning model isn't specified, it appears that the researchers created their own dataset of approximately 7362 images and leveraged transfer learning from an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model.
