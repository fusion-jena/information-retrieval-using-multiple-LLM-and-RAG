The text does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the study focuses on large audio datasets related to the urban acoustic environment (AE). These datasets are described as being too extensive for manual listening, indicating they likely contain numerous recordings. The analysis involves applying Fourier Complexity Measures (FCMs) and converting them into complex networks. Additionally, the study uses psychoacoustic data from smaller field studies. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of the exact names or sources of these datasets.
