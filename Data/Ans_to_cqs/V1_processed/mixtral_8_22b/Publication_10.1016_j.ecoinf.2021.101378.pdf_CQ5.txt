The text does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that a dataset was created consisting of seven environmental variables and the proportion of land-use types including seven categories. The dataset was extracted from digital maps using the ArcGIS 10.1 program. Digital maps for elevation and slope were obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute of Korea. Therefore, the dataset used in this study is related to environmental and land-use variables rather than image datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
