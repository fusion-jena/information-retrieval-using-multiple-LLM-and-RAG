The paper does not provide explicit information about the optimization method used for tuning the hyperparameters of the model. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether methods like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or others were employed. Further research into related papers or contact with the authors may help clarify this aspect.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the paper focuses more on comparing different approaches to plant identification rather than delving into specific details regarding the optimization techniques used for their models. The experiments conducted involve hand-crafted feature extraction and computer vision pipelines, including deep learning architectures. However, the exact process of selecting optimal hyperparameters remains unclear without additional information.
