The given context does not explicitly mention any specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used images as their primary source of data since they discuss image sizes and use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like YOLOv5. Typically, researchers collect image data using cameras, drones, or publicly available datasets like ImageNet, COCO, etc. For agricultural applications, specialized sensors or equipment may also be employed to gather relevant data.
