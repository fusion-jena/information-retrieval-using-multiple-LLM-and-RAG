Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations. However, it is common practice for researchers to share their work publicly through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I recommend searching these platforms with keywords related to the topic, such as "deep learning," "long short-term memory" (LSTM), "dissolved oxygen," and the authors' names mentioned in the given references. This should help find relevant repositories containing the desired code pipelines.

If no direct links are found, consider reaching out to the authors via email or other contact details provided in their publications. They may be able to share their code privately or guide you towards any existing public repositories.
