Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to prepare the input data. In this context, two main preprocessing steps are mentioned for the semantic segmentation model used for vegetation mapping: reducing the resolution of the images and normalizing the color channels.

Firstly, the resolution of the images in the ground-truth dataset is reduced to 1000 x 1333 pixels. This step helps decrease computational requirements during training and can also help prevent overfitting by generalizing the features learned by the model.

Secondly, the three color channels of the images are normalized by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviations per channel. Normalization scales the pixel values to a similar range, making it easier for the model to learn and converge faster. In this case, the color channel means and standard deviations are based on the ImageNet dataset used in the training of the pre-trained ResNet-50 model. The specific mean values used are [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and the standard deviations are [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].

These preprocessing steps ensure that the input data is properly formatted and scaled, enabling the deep learning model to effectively learn from the data and produce accurate results.
