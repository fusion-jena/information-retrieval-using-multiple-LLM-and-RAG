Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, it does provide some details about the experimental setup and parameters used during the training process.

For instance, the input image resolution is set at 640 x 640 pixels, indicating that images were likely resized or cropped to fit this resolution. Furthermore, the learning rate was set to 0.01, and the optimizer used was Adam. These choices suggest that the authors may have experimented with different hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration for their task.

Additionally, the context mentions that BatchNorm2d is used after each Conv2d layer. Batch Normalization is a technique used to stabilize the learning process and reduce internal covariate shift, effectively acting as a regularizer and improving generalization performance.

While these aspects do not directly address the preprocessing steps mentioned in the query, they offer insights into how the data might be prepared and handled during the training phase. To fully understand the preprocessing steps taken, one would need more detailed information regarding the dataset and its preparation prior to being fed into the model.
