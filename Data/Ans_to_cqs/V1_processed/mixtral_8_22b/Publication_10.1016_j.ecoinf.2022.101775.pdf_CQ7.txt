The text provides information about how the data was split for training a deep learning model. The authors manually removed a testing set from the available data before training their algorithms. This implies that the remaining data was used for training purposes. Furthermore, during the training process, 10% of the data was utilized as a validation set to monitor for overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which negatively impacts its ability to generalize to new data. By setting aside a portion of the training data as a validation set, the researchers could evaluate the performance of their model on unseen data and adjust it accordingly to prevent overfitting. Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for this deep learning model included manual removal of a testing set and reserving 10% of the remaining data for validation purposes.
