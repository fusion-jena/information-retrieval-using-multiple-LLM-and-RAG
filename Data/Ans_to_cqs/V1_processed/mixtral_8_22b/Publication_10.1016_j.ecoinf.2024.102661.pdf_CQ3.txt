Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, I can explain what those techniques generally entail.

Data annotation is the process of labeling raw data to train AI algorithms. It plays a crucial role in supervised learning tasks where labeled datasets are required. Two common types of data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects in images or videos to identify them. Each bounding box contains metadata like object class, location, and size. This technique is widely used in object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike semantic segmentation which labels pixels belonging to the same class together, instance segmentation identifies individual instances of objects within an image. This technique provides detailed information about the shape and spatial relationships between different objects in an image.

These techniques help improve the accuracy of deep learning models by providing explicit feedback during the training process.
