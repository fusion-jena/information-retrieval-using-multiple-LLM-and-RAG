The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it lists various datasets from Dataset 1 to Dataset 31, which could potentially be used in a machine learning or deep learning context. These datasets seem to involve spectral bands, vegetation indices, soil indices, water indices, clusters, and combinations thereof. The study also refers to LULC classes based on CLC methodology, including artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forest, scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation, open spaces with little or no vegetation, and water bodies. It is unclear whether these datasets were used in a deep learning pipeline without additional context.
