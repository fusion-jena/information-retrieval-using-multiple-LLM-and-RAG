Based on the given information, it appears that the training process for this particular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is set to run for a fixed number of epochs, specifically 500 epochs. This means that the training completes after running through all the data 500 times. However, the text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when the training should stop based on the model's performance or loss metrics. Therefore, we cannot definitively state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete beyond the fact that it runs for a predetermined number of epochs.
