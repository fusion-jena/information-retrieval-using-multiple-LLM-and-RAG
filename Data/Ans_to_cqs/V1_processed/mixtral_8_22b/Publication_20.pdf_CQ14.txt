Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the provided context to determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text discusses various aspects such as the performance of different models, application of decision rules, and comparison with human accuracy, but it does not mention any specific details about hyperparameter optimization methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context.
