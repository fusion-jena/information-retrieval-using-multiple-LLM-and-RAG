The experiment applies several data augmentation techniques to improve the learning effect and generalization performance of the network. These techniques include HSV adjustment, rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, and mosaicking. HSV adjustment modifies the image's hue, saturation, and value components. Rotation randomly rotates the image within a certain range. Scaling changes the size of the image while maintaining its aspect ratio. Cropping randomly crops a part of the image. Horizontal flipping flips the image. Lastly, mosaicking combines multiple randomly cropped, resized, and rotated images to create a single image, enhancing the background of the identified object. Table 2 provides detailed information about the hyperparameters used for data augmentation, specifying the ranges and probabilities for each technique.
