Based on the given information, the performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using Precision as a metric. Table 3 shows the Precision results of each experiment for the upper-, left-, and right-pose models. However, no specific details about how this metric was calculated were provided. Other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include Accuracy, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC, and others depending on the problem type and requirements. In this case, only Precision was mentioned as the evaluation metric.
