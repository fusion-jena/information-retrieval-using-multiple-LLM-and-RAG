The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions that a random 40% sample was taken from the NIPS4Bplus dataset for generating embeddings using the BirdNET model. This suggests that the remaining 60% could have been used for training purposes. Additionally, the text discusses the exclusion of specific bird species from the Brazil extract of BirdCLEF 2020 during model training to compare the performance of BirdNET and the trained models on unseen classes. This implies that the excluded species might be part of the testing set. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training.
