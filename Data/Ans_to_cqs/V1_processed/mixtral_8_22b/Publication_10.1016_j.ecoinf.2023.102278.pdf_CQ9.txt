According to the given context, it appears that the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, there is a reference to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) which is a biodiversity information facility. It could potentially be the data repository used for the deep learning pipeline, but without further context or explicit mention, we cannot confirm this. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
