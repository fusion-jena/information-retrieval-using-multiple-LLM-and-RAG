The purpose of the deep learning model presented in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model, known as BirdNET-Analyzer, is designed for the task of identifying and classifying bird species based on their vocalizations. This is supported by the fact that the authors mention applying the framework to more than 80 species and selecting 20 species with the highest recall scores for further analysis. Additionally, the reference to the BirdNET paper suggests that the model is part of a larger project focused on avian diversity monitoring using deep learning techniques. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary purpose of the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model is likely related to the classification or identification of bird species through their vocalizations.
