The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions Annosys, which is a generic annotation system for schema-based data using the example of biodiversity collection data. This suggests that some form of data annotation might have been employed in the process, but the exact technique remains unspecified.
