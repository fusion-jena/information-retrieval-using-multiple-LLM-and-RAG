The text does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of optical images and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with both ascending and descending orbits. This suggests that satellite imagery could be one source of raw data collection. Additionally, the mention of NIBIO's Norway-wide timber volume map implies the use of existing public datasets. Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of other potential sources such as ground surveys or sensor networks.
