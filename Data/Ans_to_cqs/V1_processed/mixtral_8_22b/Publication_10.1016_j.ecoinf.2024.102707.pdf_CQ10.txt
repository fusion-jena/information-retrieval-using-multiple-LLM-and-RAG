The information provided does not include a direct link to the code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context. However, based on the statement "To make these methods more accessible, we published the data used in this study, the code used in the analysis, and the trained machine learning model," it can be assumed that the authors have made their code available alongside their publication.

Unfortunately, without additional details or access to the full text of the publications, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository. It would be best to refer directly to the original sources listed in the context, such as Stammerjohn et al. (2020), Le et al. (2022), and Xu et al. (2024), to find the relevant links or contact the corresponding authors for further assistance.
