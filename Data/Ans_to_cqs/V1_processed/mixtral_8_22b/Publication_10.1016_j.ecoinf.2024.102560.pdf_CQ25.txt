Based on the provided context, it appears that the purpose of the deep learning model was not explicitly stated. However, there are some clues that suggest what the model might have been used for. For instance, in the paper by Aksoy et al. (2022), they mention mapping soil salinity for the Urmia Lake basin using machine learning algorithms. This suggests that the deep learning model may have been used for image segmentation or classification to identify different levels of soil salinity based on satellite imagery. Additionally, in another paper by Safarian Zengir et al. (2020), they discuss monitoring and investigating the possibility of forecasting drought in the western part of Iran. While this does not directly relate to the use of a deep learning model, it could indicate that the model was being used for predictive purposes related to environmental changes. Without more specific information about the deep learning model mentioned in the context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding its purpose.
