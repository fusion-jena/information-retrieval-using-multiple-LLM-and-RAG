Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a specific answer regarding which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. The text only discusses the optimization process of the Random Forest (RF) model, including the use of a grid search approach, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation techniques. However, no details about the hardware resources used during this process are mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your query based solely on the provided context.
