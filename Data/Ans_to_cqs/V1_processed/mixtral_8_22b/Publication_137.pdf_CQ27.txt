Based on the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, some general steps involved in deploying a trained deep learning model are:

Model Serialization: After training the model, it needs to be serialized or saved in a format that can be loaded later for making predictions. This usually involves saving the model architecture along with its weights.

Platform Selection: Once the model has been serialized, it needs to be deployed on a platform where it can receive input data and return predictions. Depending on the use case, this could involve selecting a suitable cloud service provider like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or using edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, etc.

Inference Optimizations: To ensure efficient and fast predictions, various optimizations can be applied during the deployment phase. These may include quantizing the model weights, pruning unnecessary connections, or converting the model to a more efficient representation like ONNX or TensorRT.

Monitoring and Maintenance: After deployment, it is essential to monitor the performance of the model continuously and perform any necessary maintenance tasks. This might involve retraining the model periodically with new data, updating the software dependencies, or scaling the infrastructure to handle increased traffic.
