The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions the use of Bayesian algorithms for improving the performance of automated bat identification software. In machine learning, including Bayesian methods, common criteria to determine when training is complete include observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, improvement in accuracy, or reaching a predefined maximum number of epochs or iterations. Without further details, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used in this particular case.
