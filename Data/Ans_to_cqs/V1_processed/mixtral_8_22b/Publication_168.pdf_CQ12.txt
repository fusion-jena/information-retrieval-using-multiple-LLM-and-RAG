In the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) was designed by Hu et al. [4] for classifying forest species using hyperspectral images (HSIs). This 1-D-CNN consists of a convolution operation, a pooling operation, and a fully connected operation. Additionally, the text mentions that other researchers have employed different types of CNN architectures, such as multiscale CNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and residual networks including residual blocks of spectral and spatial based on the 3-D convolutional kernel. However, these models still fall under the broader category of CNNs.
