The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy is a simple metric that measures the overall percentage of correct predictions but does not consider the types of errors. Precision is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct. Recall is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct versus correct positive predictions and incorrect negative predictions. Recall measures how many positive predictions were correctly spotted by the model. Additionally, the F1-score is another metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models.
