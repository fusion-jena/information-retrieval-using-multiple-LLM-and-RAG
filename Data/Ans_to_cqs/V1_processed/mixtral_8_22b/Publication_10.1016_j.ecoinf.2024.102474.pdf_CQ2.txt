Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated what specific data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues that can help infer possible data formats. The context mentions that the data used was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge and consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe. This suggests that the data could be in the form of images or videos, as datacubes often refer to multidimensional arrays containing spatial and temporal information, which are commonly found in remote sensing data such as satellite imagery. Additionally, the context also references several papers related to video prediction tasks and convolutional LSTM networks, further supporting the idea that the data may be in the form of videos or sequences of images. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively determined from the given context alone, it is likely that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is in the form of images or videos.
