The text mentions that the machine learning models were built using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. Specifically, the Random Forest (RF) models were developed using Scikit-learn, while the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were created using TensorFlow. Therefore, it can be concluded that both Scikit-learn and TensorFlow were utilized to construct the deep learning models.
