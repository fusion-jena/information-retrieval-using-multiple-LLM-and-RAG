The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a grid search technique. This technique involves specifying a set of values for each hyperparameter and then exhaustively trying all possible combinations of those values to find the best performing combination. In this case, the hyperparameters tuned included the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate.
