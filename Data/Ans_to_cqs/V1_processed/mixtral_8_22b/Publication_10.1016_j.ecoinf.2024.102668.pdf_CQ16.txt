Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a direct answer regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, generally speaking, some commonly used criteria include observing a plateau or decrease in validation loss, achieving a desired level of accuracy or precision, or reaching a predetermined number of epochs during the training process. It should be noted that the specific criteria may vary depending on the nature of the task, the type of machine learning algorithm being used, and the goals of the project.
