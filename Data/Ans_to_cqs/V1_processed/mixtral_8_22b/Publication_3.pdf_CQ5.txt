The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data were obtained from Cornell Universityâ€™s Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds. The researchers generated 20 spectrograms per species for their new dataset, resulting in a total of 440 spectrograms. They also added 21 new, undescribed species to increase the number of species in the TensorFlow reference library to 41. Therefore, it can be inferred that the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline consist of audio recordings of various bird species, represented as spectrograms.
