The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained using a diverse dataset consisting of 24 images per batch for 300 epochs. This suggests that the model was exposed to a variety of input data during training, which could contribute to its ability to generalize well. Additionally, the use of the optimizer RMSprop with an adaptive learning rate method may have helped improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities. The mention of the model being able to achieve accuracy similar to human-level classification accuracy also implies that it has been tested and validated against ground truth data, further supporting its potential for generalizing well to new datasets. However, without more detailed information about the exact steps taken to validate and test the model, it cannot be definitively stated what specific measures were employed to ensure its generalizability.
