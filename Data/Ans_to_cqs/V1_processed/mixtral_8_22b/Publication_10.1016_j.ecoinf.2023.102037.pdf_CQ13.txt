The paper uses the YOLOv5 model for insect detection and counting. The training procedure ran for 150 epochs, and the model was fed with batches of 16 tiles at a time. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was used as the model’s optimizer with a momentum of 0.9. However, the exact learning rate is not mentioned in the given context. The default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 were applied during training to improve the model robustness. For prediction, bounding boxes with intersection-over-union (IoU) ≥ 0.6 were considered positive, while those with IoU < 0.6 were considered negative.
