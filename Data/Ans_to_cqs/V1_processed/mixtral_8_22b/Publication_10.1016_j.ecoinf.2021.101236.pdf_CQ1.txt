The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the input data consists of single-channel mel spectrograms of size 64 x 384, visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. This suggests that the raw data collected might be audio recordings of birds, which are then converted into mel spectrograms for further processing in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions that the 3-second window length allows for implementing data augmentation methods, indicating that the raw data may have been manipulated during preprocessing to diversify the training data. Unfortunately, without more explicit information about the data collection methods, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact methods used for gathering raw data.
