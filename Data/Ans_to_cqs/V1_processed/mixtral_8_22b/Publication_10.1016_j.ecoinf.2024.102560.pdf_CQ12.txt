Based on the provided information, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned using any specific type of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, in their research. Instead, they mention using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for prognostic modeling with land-use data. However, without further clarification, it cannot be determined if the ANN used in this case is based on a particular architecture like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. Therefore, it remains uncertain what type of deep learning model is employed in the pipeline.
