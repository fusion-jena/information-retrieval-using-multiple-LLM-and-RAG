In addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same proportions of classes or labels within each set. This ensures that the classifier learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic samples are created from existing minority class examples to balance the dataset. This helps prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves reducing the size of the majority class to match the minority class. However, this method may result in loss of information if important features are discarded.

Diverse data collection entails gathering data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of all possible scenarios. This reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the generalizability of the model.

These techniques help mitigate data bias and improve the performance of deep learning models. It is essential to choose the appropriate technique based on the nature of the dataset and the problem at hand.
