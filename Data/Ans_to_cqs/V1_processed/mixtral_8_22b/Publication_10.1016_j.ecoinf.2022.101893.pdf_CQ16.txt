Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the dataset is divided into training and testing sets using an 8:2 ratio, and the classification models are built using the training set. The performance of these models is then evaluated based on their accuracy on the test set. This suggests that the authors may have used the convergence of the model's performance on the test set as one possible criterion for determining when training is complete. But without more explicit information, this cannot be confirmed.
