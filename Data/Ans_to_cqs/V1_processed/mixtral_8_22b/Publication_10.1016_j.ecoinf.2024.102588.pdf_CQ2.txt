The text does not explicitly state what type of data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses water quality and hydraulic and hydrological data as inputs for the CNN model. This suggests that the data could be in a numerical format, possibly stored in a structured file like a CSV. Additionally, the use of a one-dimensional CNN implies that the data might be represented as vectors rather than images, videos, or other multi-dimensional formats.
