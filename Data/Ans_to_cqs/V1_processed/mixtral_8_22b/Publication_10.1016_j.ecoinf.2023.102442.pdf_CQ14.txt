The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. However, it mentions several times that certain parameters are adjustable, suggesting that some form of optimization is performed.

In Step 8, the creation of sub-regions involves choosing a buffer distance, which varies depending on the input image. This indicates that there might be some experimentation with different buffer sizes to find the optimal one for each case. Similarly, in Step 19, the proximity of water bodies to mine function uses a specified distance, which is also mentioned as being adjustable. Again, this suggests that there may be some process of finding the most suitable distance for identifying pools of water in exposed pits of mines.

While the specific method of optimization isn't explicitly stated, the fact that these parameters are described as adjustable implies that some sort of iterative process is employed to determine their values. This could involve techniques like grid search or random search, but without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively confirmed.
