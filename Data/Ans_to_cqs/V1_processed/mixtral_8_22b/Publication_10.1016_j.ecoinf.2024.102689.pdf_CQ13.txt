The deep learning model uses GPU and CUDA version 11.4, with Python 3.6 as the programming language and Pytorch version 1.8.0 in conjunction with the virtual environment function of Anaconda3. The optimization is carried out using the Adam optimizer with a momentum of 0.9 and a batch size of 16. Images are processed at a resolution of 1024 Ã— 1024, with an initial learning rate set at 0.001 and a minimum learning rate of 0.0001. The descent mode is step, and training spans 300 epochs.
