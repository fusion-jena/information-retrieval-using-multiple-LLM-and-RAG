The authors have mentioned that they used data augmentation techniques to improve their model. Specifically, they generated four additional images from each original "natural" image. Two of these new images were created by increasing the contrast to 120% and 140%, while the other two were made by reducing the contrast to 80% and 60%. Additionally, they also horizontally flipped all images to further increase the size of their training dataset. However, there was no mention of any rotation or scaling being applied to the images. Therefore, the data augmentation techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline include contrast adjustment and horizontal flipping.
