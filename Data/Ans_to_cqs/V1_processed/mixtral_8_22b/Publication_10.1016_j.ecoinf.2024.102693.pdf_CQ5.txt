Based on the given context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, one dataset that is referenced is the IP102 dataset. The IP102 dataset is used to compare the performance of the proposed method with previous studies. Unfortunately, without additional context or information, I cannot provide further details about other potential datasets used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
