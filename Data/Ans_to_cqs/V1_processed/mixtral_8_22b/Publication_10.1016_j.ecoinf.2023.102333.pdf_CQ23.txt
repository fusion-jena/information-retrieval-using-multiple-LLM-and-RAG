From the given context, it appears that several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. These measures include:

1. Hyperparameter Optimization: The authors performed a comprehensive search through a large space of hyperparameters (1,788,160 combinations) to find the optimal configuration for their model. This process helps to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

2. Validation Dataset: The authors used a separate validation dataset to assess the performance of their model during the training phase. By evaluating the model's accuracy on this independent set of data, they could gauge its ability to generalize to unseen examples.

3. Confusion Matrix and Quality Metrics: To further evaluate the model's performance, the authors employed a confusion matrix and additional quality metrics such as Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), and User Accuracy (UA). These tools provide insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses across different classes, which can help identify potential areas for improvement and guide efforts to enhance generalizability.

However, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting being employed to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It is possible that these methods were utilized but not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts provided.
