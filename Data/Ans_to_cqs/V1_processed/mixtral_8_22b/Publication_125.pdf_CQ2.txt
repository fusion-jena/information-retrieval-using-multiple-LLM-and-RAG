The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided about the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the discussion of satellite images, we can infer that the data format used in this case is likely image data. CNNs are particularly effective for image-based data processing and computer vision tasks. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the deep learning pipeline discussed here involves using image data. Other possible data formats such as audio or video are not mentioned in the context, nor is there any indication that structured data like CSV files were used.
