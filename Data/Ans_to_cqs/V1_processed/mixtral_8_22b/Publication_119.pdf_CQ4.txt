Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling being applied in the given context. However, we do see some strategies employed to enhance the performance of the deep learning models. For instance, the use of a pretrained U-Net model within the arcgis.learn module helped overcome the limitation of having a small dataset. This approach leverages transfer learning, where a model trained on one task is reused as the starting point for another related task. Furthermore, the implementation of dropout and batch normalization layers in the DNN model improved its performance by reducing overfitting and increasing generalization on testing data. Lastly, hyperparameter optimization played a crucial role in selecting the best model configuration, including parameters like input patch size and the choice of a ResNet-50 backbone.
