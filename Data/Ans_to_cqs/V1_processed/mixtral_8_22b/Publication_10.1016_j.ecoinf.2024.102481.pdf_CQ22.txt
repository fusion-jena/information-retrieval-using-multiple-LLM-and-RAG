The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics from the confusion matrix. These include Cohen's kappa coefficient (Îº) to measure the proportion of agreements, Precision to determine the proportion of correct predictions, Sensitivity for the true positive rate (correctly predicted phases), Specificity for the true negative rate (correct allocation to other phases), and Prevalence for the proportion within each phase. Additionally, the error percentage is reported.
