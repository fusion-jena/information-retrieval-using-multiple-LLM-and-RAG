The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired accuracy or performance metric, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In this case, since no explicit criteria are mentioned, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
