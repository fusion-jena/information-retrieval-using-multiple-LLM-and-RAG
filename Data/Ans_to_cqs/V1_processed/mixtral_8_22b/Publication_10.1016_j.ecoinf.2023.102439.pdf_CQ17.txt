Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data due to its complexity or high variance. Regularization helps reduce this issue by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization, which discourages large weights and encourages simpler models. Two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are temporarily removed ("dropped out") from the network during each iteration of training. This forces the remaining neurons to learn more robust features and prevents any single neuron from becoming too influential. As a result, the network becomes more resilient to noise and generalizes better to new data. Dropout rates typically range between 0.2 and 0.5, depending on the size and complexity of the network.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights and thus simpler models, reducing the risk of overfitting. The strength of the penalty can be controlled by adjusting the regularization parameter lambda. Higher values of lambda will result in stronger penalties and simpler models, while lower values will allow for more complex models.

In summary, regularization methods such as Dropout and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by introducing penalties to the loss function during optimization. Dropout achieves this by randomly dropping out neurons during training, while L2 regularization penalizes large weights, encouraging simpler models. Both techniques aim to improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
