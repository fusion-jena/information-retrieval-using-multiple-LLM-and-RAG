The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the validation set, or observing no significant improvement in validation metrics over several epochs (i.e., a validation loss plateau). In this case, since the context mentions "trials and errors" during the training phase, it suggests that the determination might have been made through empirical observation rather than adherence to a predefined stopping rule. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, we cannot definitively state what criterion was used to decide when training should conclude.
