The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is primarily for regression tasks rather than classification, segmentation, or detection. The authors employ 'transfer learning' by utilizing pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on ImageNet. However, the main objective of these models is to predict specific plant functional traits based on RGB images and bioclimatic data. The regressor following the basic CNN consists of a global average pooling layer followed by two dense layers with 512 and 1 output units. The latter forces the CNN to output exactly one prediction (trait) value. In cases where multiple input data types are involved, such as setups (3) and (4), the CNN consists of parallel branches to incorporate the different input data types. The branch processing the bioclimatic data consists of three dense layers with 64, 32, and 4 output units, while the last layer of the CNN regressor contains 4 output units.
