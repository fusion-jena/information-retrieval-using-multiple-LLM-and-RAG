The given context does not provide explicit details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that a deep neural network was employed for fish biomass estimation. Deep learning models typically involve various hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizers (like Adam, SGD), etc. Without further information from the authors or the original paper, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in their deep learning model.
