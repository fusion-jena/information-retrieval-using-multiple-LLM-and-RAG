Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. However, it does suggest that the mini-batch size is adjustable and typically incremented in binary numbers. It also mentions that the optimal mini-batch size depends on factors like the dataset, computational complexity, and available GPU memory. Furthermore, it suggests that a reasonable starting point for setting other hyperparameters could be based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis tasks, followed by refining those settings through trial and error. Nonetheless, due to the time-consuming nature of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this limits the extent of trial and error that can be performed. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be definitively stated how the hyperparameters of the model were specifically optimized.
