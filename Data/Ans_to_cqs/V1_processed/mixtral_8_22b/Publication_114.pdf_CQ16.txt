The determination of when training is complete can vary depending on the specific model or algorithm being used. However, some common criteria include observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss over several epochs, achieving a predetermined level of performance on a validation set, or reaching a maximum number of training iterations. In the case of deep learning models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet mentioned in the given context, one possible criterion could be monitoring the validation loss and stopping the training process once it reaches a plateau or starts increasing again, indicating potential overfitting. Another approach could involve setting a target performance metric, such as overall accuracy (OA) or Kappa coefficient, and halting training once this threshold has been reached. Ultimately, the choice of criteria will depend on the goals and constraints of the particular application.
