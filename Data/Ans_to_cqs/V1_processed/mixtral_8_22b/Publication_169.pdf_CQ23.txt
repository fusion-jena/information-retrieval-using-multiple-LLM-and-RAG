Based on the provided information, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the paper does report that the proposed CNN-LSTM model attained an accuracy of 95.06%, which is higher than the literature reported accuracy of 91%. This suggests that the model may be robust and potentially generalizable, but without further details about the data collection and preprocessing steps, it is difficult to definitively determine the extent of the model's generalizability.
