Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions that the Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides an extensive repository of Earth observation data but does not specify if this includes the specific dataset used in the study or if it is publicly accessible. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
