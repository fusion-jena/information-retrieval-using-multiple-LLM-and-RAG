The context does not provide information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance.

Based on the given context, it can be observed that deep learning techniques have been utilized for various applications, including individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data using the PointNet of deep learning (Chen et al., 2021) and monitoring landscape changes using drones (Do et al., 2022). In these studies, the Faster R-CNN network with a Resnet-101 backend was trained for 20,000 iterations using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.003, momentum of 0.9, and a batch size of 1 (Do et al., 2022). Although no explicit mention of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is made, it can be assumed that standard practices, such as setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, might have been followed during the implementation of these models.
