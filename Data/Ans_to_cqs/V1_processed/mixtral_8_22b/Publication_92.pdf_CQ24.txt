The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, there are general strategies used in deep learning pipelines to manage randomness:

1. Seed Initialization: Random seeds can be initialized before training the model to ensure reproducibility. This means setting a specific seed value for all random operations within the code, including data shuffling, dropout regularization, and weight initialization. By doing so, the model's performance should remain consistent across multiple runs.

2. Data Shuffling: To prevent overfitting and ensure that the model learns from diverse examples, datasets are often randomly shuffled during training. This introduces randomness into the process, but it can be controlled by using a fixed seed value or ensuring that the dataset is consistently shuffled in the same way between runs.

3. Dropout Regularization: Dropout is a technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out nodes during training. While this adds randomness to the process, it can be managed by using a fixed seed value or applying dropout consistently across different runs.

4. Weight Initialization: During the initialization phase, weights are assigned random values. To maintain consistency across runs, these weights can be initialized using a fixed seed value or a deterministic algorithm like Xavier or He initialization.

While the given text does not explicitly mention these strategies, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to manage randomness and ensure reproducible results.
