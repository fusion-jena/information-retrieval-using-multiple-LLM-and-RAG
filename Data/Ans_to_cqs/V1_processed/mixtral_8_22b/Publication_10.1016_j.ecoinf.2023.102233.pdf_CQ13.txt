In this study, the authors used a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to develop a call recognition system for a threatened species, the southern black-throated finch. They employed an active learning approach to improve their model iteratively.

Regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, the text mentions that they utilized a grid search technique to tune the hyperparameters of the final model. This technique involves testing various combinations of hyperparameters to find the optimal set that yields the best performance.

Specifically, the authors mention that they tuned the following hyperparameters:

1. Number of epochs: Ten epochs were used during the active learning iterations. However, it is not explicitly stated whether this was also the case for the final model after applying the grid search technique.

2. Batch size: A batch size of 64 was used during the active learning iterations. Similar to the number of epochs, it is unclear if this remained the same for the final model.

3. Learning rate: The initial learning rate used during the active learning iterations was 0.001. Again, there is no explicit information about any changes made to the learning rate when fine-tuning the final model.

Unfortunately, the given context does not provide details regarding the specific optimizer used in the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the provided information, I can only confirm that the hyperparameters mentioned above were adjusted during the process of developing the final model.
