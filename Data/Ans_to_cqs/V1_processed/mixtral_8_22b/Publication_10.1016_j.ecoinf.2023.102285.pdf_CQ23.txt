To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. These include:

1. Using diverse datasets: The study utilized various datasets consisting of different types of objects and environments. For instance, the dataset used for establishing the methodology consisted of 57 images with ISMMMOs and 5000 images without ISMMMOs. Additionally, another independent dataset was used for validation by field experts.

2. Cross-validation: To further validate the performance of the model, it was evaluated using recent surveys. This involved preparing a dataset to assess the eligibility of the methodology. The test results were then presented in Table 10 B.

3. Stratified splitting: The dataset was divided into training, testing, and validation sets. This allowed for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring its ability to generalize to new data.

4. Independent verification dataset: After obtaining satisfactory results in Phase III, the system was validated by field experts using other independent datasets. This step aimed to confirm whether the methodology worked as intended for other datasets.

Overall, these measures helped ensure the robustness and reliability of the deep learning model, enabling it to perform well on new, unseen data.
