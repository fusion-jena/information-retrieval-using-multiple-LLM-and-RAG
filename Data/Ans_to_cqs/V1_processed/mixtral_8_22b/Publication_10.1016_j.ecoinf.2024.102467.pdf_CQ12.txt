The pipeline utilizes a combination of different types of deep learning models. Primarily, it employs EfficientNetV2, which is a variant of the EfficientNet family of models. These models are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and are known for their efficiency and performance. Additionally, the pipeline incorporates a Bottleneck Transformer, which combines elements of both convolutional and attention mechanisms. Specifically, it integrates multi-head self-attention (MHSA) into the ResNet architecture, replacing certain spatial convolutions. This allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies within the data.
