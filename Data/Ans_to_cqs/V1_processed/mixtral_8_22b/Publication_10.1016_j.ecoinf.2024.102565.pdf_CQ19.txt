Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have primarily used MATLAB programming software (MathWorks, 2021) to create and evaluate their models. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch being used. Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors did not use either TensorFlow or PyTorch for building their deep learning models.
