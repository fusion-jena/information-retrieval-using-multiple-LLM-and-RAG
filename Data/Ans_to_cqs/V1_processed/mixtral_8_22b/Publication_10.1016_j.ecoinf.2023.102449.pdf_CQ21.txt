The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific post-processing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common post-processing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics help in understanding how well the model has learned from the training data and how accurately it can predict new instances.

2. Visualization Techniques: Post-training visualizations like saliency maps or heatmaps can be used to understand which parts of the input data were most influential in making predictions. This helps in interpreting the model's decision-making process.

3. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is often used to summarize the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the classifier compared with the actual outcomes.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: After initial training, hyperparameters may need adjustment to improve model performance. This could involve techniques like grid search or random search.

5. Ensemble Methods: Sometimes, multiple models might be combined to create an ensemble model, which can potentially offer better performance than individual models.

6. Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be deployed into production where it makes predictions on real-world data.
