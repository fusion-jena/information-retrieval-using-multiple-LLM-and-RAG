In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall being used to measure the performance of a deep learning model. However, the text does discuss the use of accuracy assessments in evaluating the performance of their models. Two types of accuracy assessments are mentioned: (i) 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions, which aims to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy (OA), and (ii) predictions based on the testing dataset, where they calculate user's accuracies (UAs) and producer's accuracies (PAs). Therefore, from the given context, it can be inferred that the authors primarily focus on overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracies (UAs), and producer's accuracies (PAs) as their chosen evaluation metrics.
