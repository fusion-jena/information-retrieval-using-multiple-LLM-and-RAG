The given context does not provide information about the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically focusing on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, for multi-layer classification tasks related to wildfire detection. The researchers employed RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV methods from the scikit-learn library to optimize the hyperparameters of the RF algorithm. They aimed to identify the most relevant predictors from S2 imagery and integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques into their approach. However, no mention was made of any particular deep learning architecture being utilized in the process.
