The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the embedding function fϕ has learnable parameters ϕ, and in the baseline system, D=128 and M=64, where D is the input dimension and M is the output dimension of the embedding function. It also states that fϕ is a neural network, but the architecture or any other specific details regarding the network are not mentioned. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot give a precise answer to what hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model.
