The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and translating images. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, improving the performance and generalization ability of deep learning models.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that deep learning is being employed in various studies related to agriculture, ecosystem services, and land use patterns. For instance, Ren et al. (2023) discuss the application of deep learning algorithms for strategic planning in ecosystem service values and food supply and demand in Liaoning Province. Similarly, Rotar and Sangeorzan (2018) explore the evolution of minimum arable land and food consumption using deep learning techniques.

However, without explicit mention or discussion of data augmentation techniques within these studies, it cannot be determined which specific techniques were utilized in their respective deep learning pipelines.
