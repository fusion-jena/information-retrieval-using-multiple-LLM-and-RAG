The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as one of the algorithms considered for modeling. ANNs can be considered a subset of deep learning models but do not specify which type of deep learning architecture was employed. Therefore, without further context, we cannot determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
