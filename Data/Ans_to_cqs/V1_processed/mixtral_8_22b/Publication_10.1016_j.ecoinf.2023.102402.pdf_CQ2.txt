The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of any specific data format in a deep learning pipeline. However, it is possible to infer some potential data formats based on the information given. For instance, the references to GBIF Occurrence Download suggest that the data might include geographical coordinates or location data, which could potentially be represented in a CSV file or other tabular format. Additionally, the reference to Ballard et al.'s paper on contributions to conservation outcomes by museum-led citizen science suggests that there may be images or videos involved in the data collection process. Finally, the reference to Broennimann et al.'s paper on measuring ecological niche overlap implies that there may be spatial environmental data involved, which could take various forms depending on the specific application. Overall, while we cannot definitively determine what data formats are being used in the deep learning pipeline without more explicit information, we can reasonably assume that they may involve a combination of different types of data, including but not limited to images, videos, and tabular data.
