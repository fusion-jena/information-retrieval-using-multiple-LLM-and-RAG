Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information regarding specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculations, confusion matrices, etc. However, some aspects of the process could be considered as part of postprocessing. After generating redescriptions using SIREN, users have the ability to visualize, cluster, and interactively edit them. These actions might be considered as postprocessing steps since they occur after the initial generation of redescriptions. Additionally, the text mentions requirements for the size of the support of the output redescriptions and controlling the length and complexity of their queries. These adjustments could also be seen as postprocessing steps aimed at improving the quality and interpretability of the results.
