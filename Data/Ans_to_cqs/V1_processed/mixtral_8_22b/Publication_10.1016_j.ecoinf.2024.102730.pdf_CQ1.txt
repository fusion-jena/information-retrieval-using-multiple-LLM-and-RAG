The sources provided do not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in the field, some possible methods include:

1. Surveys: Data collection through surveys involves gathering information directly from individuals about their opinions, behaviors, or characteristics. This method is commonly used in social sciences but can also be applied in other fields such as agriculture or environmental science. For example, surveys could be conducted to gather information about crop yields, land use patterns, or farmer practices.

2. Sensors: Sensors are devices that detect and respond to physical or chemical stimuli, providing real-time data on various parameters. They are widely used in agriculture and environmental monitoring to collect data on variables such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture, and nutrient levels. Examples of sensor technologies used in these applications include weather stations, soil moisture probes, and spectral sensors.

3. Public Datasets: Publicly available datasets provide researchers with access to large amounts of pre-existing data that can be used for training and testing deep learning models. Some examples of publicly available datasets related to vegetation studies include satellite imagery from platforms such as Landsat, Sentinel, or MODIS; climate data from repositories like WorldClim or CRU; and agricultural census data from organizations such as FAOSTAT or USDA.

In summary, while the sources provided do not specifically discuss methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, potential approaches include conducting surveys, utilizing sensors, and leveraging publicly available datasets.
