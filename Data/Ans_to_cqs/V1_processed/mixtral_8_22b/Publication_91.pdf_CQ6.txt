The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions several image processing techniques applied to the training data. These include center cropping all images to an equally sized rectangle and applying various augmentations like horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, adjustments in brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. These augmentations help create a more diverse and robust dataset, which can improve the performance and generalizability of the deep learning model.
