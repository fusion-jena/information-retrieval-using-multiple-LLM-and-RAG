Based on the given context, no specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are mentioned as part of a deep learning pipeline. Instead, the study focuses on analyzing tweets obtained through the 'Full-archive search endpoint' of the Twitter API. The authors use the twarc2 library to handle the returned data in JSON format and manage the quota limits and pagination resulting from queries. They perform searches based on words, hashtags, or combinations within the text of tweets. However, they do mention that image recognition models could potentially be beneficial for identifying relevant images in tweets, but due to the limited geographic scope of their study, they did not invest significant resources into developing such a model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the study does not explicitly utilize any common deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
