The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, generally speaking, some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating evaluation metrics such as accuracy or F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and visualizing results using various techniques like heatmaps or scatter plots. These steps help assess the performance of the trained model and provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses. It is important to note that these postprocessing steps may vary depending on the type of problem being solved and the chosen modeling approach.

Based on the given context, it appears that the study involves using LiDAR data from NASAâ€™s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission along with other datasets to analyze forest ecosystems. The authors discuss how they used machine learning algorithms to create a global forest canopy height map by combining GEDI data with phenology metrics based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. They also mention limitations of working with GEDI data due to its large footprint and sparse sampling design. However, there is no explicit discussion about postprocessing steps taken after model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer regarding this aspect based solely on the provided context.
