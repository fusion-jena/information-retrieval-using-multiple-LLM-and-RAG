Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the trained model is hosted using TensorFlow 2.2 and served through a public-facing website developed by the authors. However, it does not specify any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
