The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is for classification. Specifically, it is designed to classify bird sounds into one of 43 bird species. The model employs a VGG-style network, which has been previously used for classifying acoustic scenes. It uses the categorical cross entropy as its loss function and is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4. The goal of this study is not to obtain a single CNN-based model with the best performance, but rather to investigate the effectiveness of fusion of different CNN-based models.
