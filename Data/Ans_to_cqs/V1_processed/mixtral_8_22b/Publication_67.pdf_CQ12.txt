The study uses a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model called Inception v.3 for its pipeline. This model was trained on five different datasets, which included examples of images with varying levels of tree cover, both continuous and discrete approximations, and an additional auxiliary class labeled as "Non-Forest." During the training process, two optimization techniques were employed - transfer learning and data augmentation. Afterward, the trained model was utilized to classify new images with various tree covers in global drylands. Finally, the performance of the model was assessed through validation.
