The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on the given context, one can infer that visual assessment was employed to evaluate classification accuracy. Random points were selected within the analysis regions for each image, and the class at those points was manually inspected. A stratified sampling strategy was adopted to ensure sufficient representation of the less frequent classes. Additionally, preliminary accuracies were compared between different sites before pooling the accuracy assessment across them. Furthermore, the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) suggests that statistical measures might also have been utilized to track the model performance during training. Nonetheless, without further details regarding the actual implementation, it remains uncertain what exact metrics or methodologies were applied to monitor the model performance.
