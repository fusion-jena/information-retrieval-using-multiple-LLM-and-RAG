The text mentions two types of deep learning models used in the pipeline: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). CNNs are highly effective for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification due to their ability to extract complex features from satellite imagery. On the other hand, RNNs demonstrate the capability to learn and adapt to changing LULC patterns continuously, capturing temporal shifts and variations in land cover patterns.
