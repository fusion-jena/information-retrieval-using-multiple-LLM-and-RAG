Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some references suggest that remote sensing data, such as LiDAR data [29], drone images [67], and satellite data [68], might be used as input sources for deep learning models. Additionally, reference [65] mentions the use of R programming language for deep learning, implying that publicly available datasets could also serve as potential sources of raw data. Nevertheless, without further context, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods are employed for gathering raw data in this particular case.
