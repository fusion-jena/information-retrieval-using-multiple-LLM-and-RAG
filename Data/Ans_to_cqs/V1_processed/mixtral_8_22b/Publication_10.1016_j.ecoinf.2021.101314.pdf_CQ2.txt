Based on the given information, there is no direct mention of what specific data formats were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we do have some clues regarding the types of data involved in the study.

Firstly, the research involves analyzing dental traits and bioclimatic variables. Dental traits could potentially include images or other visual representations of teeth, which might suggest using image data format. On the other hand, bioclimatic variables would likely consist of numerical data, possibly stored in a structured format like CSV or Excel files.

Secondly, the paper mentions generating redescriptions based on these datasets. Redescriptions refer to finding alternative ways to describe the same dataset, often involving different combinations of features or attributes. This process does not necessarily depend on the original data format; instead, it focuses on extracting meaningful patterns and relationships within the data.

Lastly, the authors discuss running their analysis on a commodity laptop, implying that the computational requirements for processing the data are relatively modest. While this doesn't directly indicate the data format, it suggests that the input data may not require extensive preprocessing or specialized hardware to handle large volumes of unstructured data like videos or high-resolution images.

In conclusion, although the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline remain unknown, we can infer that they likely involve a combination of image data for dental traits and structured data (like CSV) for bioclimatic variables.
