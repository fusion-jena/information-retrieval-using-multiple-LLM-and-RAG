After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be applied depending on the specific requirements of the project. Based on the given context, some possible postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Segmentation: After training the DeepLabv3+ model with COCO classes, the trained model is used to perform semantic segmentation on input images. This step involves classifying each pixel into one of the predefined categories based on its visual features.

2. Real Distance Extraction: To estimate distances from the camera to various objects in the scene, real distance extraction techniques such as triangulation or stereoscopic vision may be employed. These methods rely on multiple views of the same scene captured from different angles or positions.

3. Metric Extraction: Once the distances have been estimated, relevant metrics like Normalized Segment Length, Sample Variance, Average Absolute Deviation, etc., can be calculated for each identified object category. These metrics help quantify the characteristics of the detected objects and their distribution within the image.

4. Skyline Extraction & Filtering: Since the focus of this research is on measuring skyline variations, it becomes essential to accurately identify and extract the skyline from the segmented images. Postprocessing steps might involve binarizing the results, filtering out images lacking natural objects beneath the sky, selecting reference points, and associating them with the corresponding classified objects.

5. Orthophoto Processing: For further analysis, orthophotos can be generated from the original images using topographical maps. These orthophotos provide accurate representations of the terrain while preserving the geometric properties of the original images.

6. Evaluation: Finally, evaluations like calculating the gain length using equation (1) mentioned in the paper could be performed to assess the improvement achieved through the application of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) during postprocessing.
