Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as the train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be assumed that common practices were followed, such as randomly splitting the dataset into these subsets, typically with around 70-80% of the data allocated for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing. These percentages may vary depending on the size of the dataset and other factors. It would be necessary to refer to additional sources or documentation related to this study to obtain more precise details regarding the data splitting process.
