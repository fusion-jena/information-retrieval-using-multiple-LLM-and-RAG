The pipeline uses a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called ResNet152 as the baseline for classification performance. Initially, this network was programmed using pre-trained weights lifted from the ImageNet challenge. The top fully-connected layer was replaced with a layer using ReLU activation, followed by a dropout layer and a softmax layer, with outputs corresponding to the number of classes (here 61). Firstly, the top layer was trained alone; using features extracted from the convolutional layers, a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 10^-3, and weight decay rate set to 5 x 10^-4. Then, the whole network was trained with SGD.
