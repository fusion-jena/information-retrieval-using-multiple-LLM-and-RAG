Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated what type of data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some hints that suggest the data could potentially be audio recordings. For instance, the mention of "insect recordings" and "acoustically recorded bird songs" suggests that the data could be related to audio signals. Additionally, the use of Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) and AutoEncoders (AEs) for feature extraction and reconstruction further supports this idea, as these models are commonly used for processing sequential data like audio signals. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely audio recordings.
