The text does not provide explicit details about how the hyperparameters were optimized. However, it mentions a Control() function which is likely used to help evaluate the tuning parameters for model performance. Additionally, there is mention of a table (Table S3) that contains parameterization settings including the number of tuning parameters or iterations and tuning methods. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization was performed, but without further specifics, we cannot definitively state whether this was done through methods such as grid search or random search.
