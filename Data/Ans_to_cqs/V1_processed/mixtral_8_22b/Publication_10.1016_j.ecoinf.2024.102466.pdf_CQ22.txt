The primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this context is mean Average Precision (mAP). The mAP is calculated by taking the average precision value for recall values between 0 and 1. Additionally, the metric area is divided into three distinct ranges: APs, APm, and APl, corresponding to varying pixel sizes of the bird instances. These ranges denote average precision for small, medium, and large size targets, respectively. The specific pixel size ranges for each category are defined as follows: Area < 322 pixels for APs, 322 < Area < 962 pixels for APm, and Area > 962 pixels for APl.
