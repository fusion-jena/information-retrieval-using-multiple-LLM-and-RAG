Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context only mentions that machine learning methods were used along with field-collected data to develop Above Ground Biomass (AGB) models. However, it does not provide any details regarding the use of specific deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine which type of deep learning model was utilized in the pipeline.
