The purpose of the deep learning model proposed in the given context is to classify fish from different families using DNA barcode sequences. This is achieved by fusing Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). The model consists of three stages: preprocessing original data from DNA barcode sequences, learning deep features using EN-SAE, and selecting a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classifying fish from different families using KDE. The goal is to overcome the challenges posed by the high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences and the limited number of fish species available for analysis.
