The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria could include reaching a certain level of accuracy, achieving a stable validation loss over several epochs, or meeting a predefined threshold for performance metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. In this case, since the authors mention using transfer learning and freezing layers during training, they might have relied on these techniques to optimize the model's performance and decide when to stop training. Nevertheless, without further details, it is impossible to pinpoint the exact criteria used in this study.
