Based on the given context, the paper titled "Mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at large scale from space with deep learning" by Couttenier et al. (2022) uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for their deep learning model. This information can be derived from the title itself, as it mentions the use of deep learning and specifically refers to mapping artisanal and small-scale mines, which aligns with the purpose of the Gallwey et al. (2020) paper mentioned earlier. However, without explicit confirmation from the text or abstract of the Couttenier et al. (2022) paper, we cannot be absolutely certain about the specific type of deep learning model used.
