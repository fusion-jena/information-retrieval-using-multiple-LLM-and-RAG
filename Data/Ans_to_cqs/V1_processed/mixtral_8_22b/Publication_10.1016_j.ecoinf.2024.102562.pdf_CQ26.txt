Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various image augmentation techniques such as flip, rotations, affine transformations, multiply, linear contrast, sharpen, emboss, etc. These techniques can be used to increase the diversity of the training data and potentially reduce any inherent bias present in the original dataset. Additionally, the text mentions the use of ResNet-101 network with heavier augmentation for 500 epochs, which could also help mitigate data bias. Nevertheless, other common techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
