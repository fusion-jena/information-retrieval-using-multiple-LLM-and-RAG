Based on the given information, it appears that the optimization method used for this particular model is Adam processing. However, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific hyperparameter optimization strategy employed in this case.
