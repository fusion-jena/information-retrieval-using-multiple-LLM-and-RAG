The information provided does not include any specific details about a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query. However, some of the references mentioned in the text might contain relevant links or resources related to the topic. For instance, the paper by Deneu et al. (2022) uses a convolutional neural network to model species distributions, so it may be worth checking their work for more information. Additionally, the R Core Team reference suggests using the R programming language for statistical computing, which could potentially involve deep learning pipelines. Unfortunately, without further context or specific details, I am unable to provide a precise code repository link for a deep learning pipeline.
