The given context does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of Genetic Programming (GP) as a method for system identification of rainfall-runoff models and the utilization of the Eureka Pro software for GP modeling. Additionally, the text mentions the use of IVS (Input Variable Selection) techniques, which are important for improving the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. While these details do not directly address the query regarding measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, they suggest that the authors may have considered aspects related to model performance and generalizability during the development and implementation of their model. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it cannot be definitively stated what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based solely on the provided context.
