The text mentions that the AutoML procedure generates a set of candidate models with architectures and hyperparameters selected at random from a prespecified range of values. However, it does not explicitly state which hyperparameters were used in the deep learning model. Based on common practice in deep learning, some possible hyperparameters could include the learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type (e.g., Adam, SGD), and regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, L1/L2 regularization). Without additional information, we cannot provide a definitive list of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
