The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used for the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. It only mentions that the model was built using PyTorch and trained on an Nvidia V100 GPU. Additionally, the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and later fine-tuned on their own datasets, applying a five-fold subject-exclusive method to prevent subjects appearing in both training and testing sets simultaneously. Data augmentation techniques like horizontal flipping were utilized to address overfitting and imbalance issues. Furthermore, the last three fully connected layers of the original VGG model were replaced with one fully connected layer to decrease parameters, and batch normalization was adopted to expedite network training.
