The given context does not provide explicit information regarding the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) to minimize the loss function during model training. These methods adjust the weights and biases of the neural networks iteratively to improve performance. Without further details from the context, it can only be assumed that similar standard optimization techniques might have been employed.
