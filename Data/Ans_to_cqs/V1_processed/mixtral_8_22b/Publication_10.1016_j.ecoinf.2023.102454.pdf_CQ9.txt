The information provided does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions several sources for different types of data used in the study. For instance, the nighttime lighting data is available for free download at the National Earth System Science Data Centre. Additionally, provincial statistical energy data for 2000-2021 are obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook, municipal statistical data are obtained from the Xi'an Statistical Yearbook, and administrative boundary data for Xi'an are provided by the National Basic Geographic Information System. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding its data repository.
