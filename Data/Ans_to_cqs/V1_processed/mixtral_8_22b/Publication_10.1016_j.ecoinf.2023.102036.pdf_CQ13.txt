The table titled 'Model training optimized parameters' provides information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. These include the learning rate, momentum, SD threshold, and input size. The search intervals for these parameters were [0,1], [0.05, 0.25], {(75, 125, 3), (100, 150, 3), (200, 250, 3)}, respectively. The optimized values for these parameters were found to be 0.096, 0.845, 0.05, and (200, 250, 3), respectively. Additionally, each optimization run consisted of 3000 train iterations with a batch size of 25 individuals to pick a pair of similar and a pair of dissimilar photos (i.e., a batch size of 100 images), and validating each 300 iterations. TensorBoard was used to study the performance of the runs.
