In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically related to the random seed value. However, some general practices can be discussed.

Randomness in deep learning pipelines often arises due to various factors like weight initialization, data shuffling, dropout regularization, etc. To manage this randomness and ensure reproducibility, one common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value. This ensures that every time the code is run, it produces the same results, making experiments more reliable and comparable.

In Python, for instance, libraries like NumPy and PyTorch allow users to set a specific seed value. By calling `numpy.random.seed(seed_value)` or `torch.manual_seed(seed_value)`, the user can control the randomness in their respective operations.

However, it should be noted that while fixing the seed value helps in reproducing results, it might also limit the exploration of different possible solutions during the training process. Therefore, it's crucial to understand when to fix the seed and when not to do so.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not discuss these aspects directly. It primarily focuses on employing MobileNetV3 transfer learning for plant identification, comparing its performance against other models, and developing an offline smartphone application for tree species identification in remote areas.
