In addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One approach is stratified splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on specific criteria or characteristics. This ensures that each subset maintains the same proportional representation of the original dataset, thereby reducing potential biases introduced through random sampling.

Oversampling and undersampling are also effective strategies to mitigate data imbalance issues. Oversampling increases the size of minority classes by duplicating existing instances or generating synthetic examples, whereas undersampling reduces majority classes by randomly removing instances. Both methods aim to achieve balanced distributions across different categories within the dataset.

Additionally, diverse data collection plays a crucial role in minimizing data bias. By gathering information from various sources and perspectives, researchers can ensure their datasets encompass a wide range of scenarios and conditions. This comprehensive coverage helps prevent any single factor or group from dominating the analysis results, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable outcomes.

However, it should be noted that none of these techniques alone guarantees complete elimination of data bias. A combination of multiple strategies tailored to the specific requirements and constraints of individual projects often yields optimal results. Furthermore, continuous monitoring and evaluation throughout the entire deep learning pipeline remain essential to maintain high-quality data and robust performance.
