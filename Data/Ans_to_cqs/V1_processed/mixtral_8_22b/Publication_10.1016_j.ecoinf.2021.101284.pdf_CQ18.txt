Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to determine the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training for this particular study. However, common strategies include using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), cross-validation techniques, learning curves, and confusion matrices. These methods help evaluate how well a machine learning model performs during its training phase.
