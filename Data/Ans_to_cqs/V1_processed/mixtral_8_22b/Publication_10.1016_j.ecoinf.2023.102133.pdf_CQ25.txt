The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for predicting daily evapotranspiration (ETa). This is supported by the mention of the Random Forest method achieving the best performance in estimating ETa with a root mean square error (RMSE) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.39 mm/day and 0.84, respectively. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was calibrated under regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) conditions to estimate ETa and save irrigation water. Therefore, it can be concluded that the purpose of the deep learning model is to accurately predict daily evapotranspiration for efficient water management in agriculture.
