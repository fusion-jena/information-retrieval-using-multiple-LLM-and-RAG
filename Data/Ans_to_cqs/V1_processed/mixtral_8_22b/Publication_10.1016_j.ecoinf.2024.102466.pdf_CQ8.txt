The article does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The authors mention testing eight object detection algorithms (Faster RCNN, Cascade RCNN, RetinaNet, FCOS, RepPoints, ATSS, Deformable-DETR, and Sparse RCNN), but they do not specify if or where the code for implementing these algorithms is publicly accessible. To find out whether the code repository is available, one would need to contact the corresponding author or search online resources such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket for any repositories associated with this research.
