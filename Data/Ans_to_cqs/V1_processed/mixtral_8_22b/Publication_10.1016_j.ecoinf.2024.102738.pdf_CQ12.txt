The information provided does not explicitly mention the use of a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. However, it does reference the Random Forest algorithm, which is a popular machine learning technique but not a deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model, if any, is used in the pipeline.
