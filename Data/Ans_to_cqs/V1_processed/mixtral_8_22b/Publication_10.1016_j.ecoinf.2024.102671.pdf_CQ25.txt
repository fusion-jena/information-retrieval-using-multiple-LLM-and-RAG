The text does not provide explicit information about the purpose of any specific deep learning model used in the study. However, based on the given context, it can be inferred that the study aims to use statistical and machine learning techniques, including potentially deep learning methods, to model the relationship between landscape features and ecological carbon sink capabilities. This suggests that the purpose of such a deep learning model might involve tasks like regression or prediction to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of different landscapes based on their features. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what the exact purpose of the deep learning model would be.

Based on the context provided, there is no clear indication of the specific purpose of a deep learning model within the study. However, considering the overall goal of modeling relationships between landscape features and ecological carbon sink capabilities, one possible application of a deep learning model could be in performing tasks related to regression or prediction. These tasks may help estimate the carbon sequestration potential of various landscapes based on their respective features. Nonetheless, without additional information, it remains uncertain what the precise function of the deep learning model would entail.
