Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context does mention that other machine learning algorithms, including deep learning algorithms, have been applied to hyperspectral data to predict water quality parameters with improved accuracy and performance. However, no details about the specific hyperparameters used in these models are provided. It is also mentioned that artificial neural networks (ANNs) and extreme machine learning have become popular for developing semi-empirical models, but again, no information about their hyperparameters is included. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately answer this query.
