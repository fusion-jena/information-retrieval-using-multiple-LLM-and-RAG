The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments. These techniques are used to enhance the network's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen data. By rotating, flipping, and adjusting the brightness of the input images, the network becomes more robust to variations in the data, improving its overall performance.
