The given context does not provide specific information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it mentions that Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR) use regularization techniques which make them highly effective for complex predictive modeling tasks. Regularization in SVR involves using a penalty term to balance model complexity and empirical risk, thus preventing overfitting. Specifically, SVR employs a C regularization parameter to control this tradeoff. Other regularization methods mentioned in the context include Ridge Regression (also known as L2 regularization) and Lasso Regression (which combines both L1 and L2 regularizations). These methods add penalties to the loss function during training, encouraging simpler models and reducing the likelihood of overfitting.
