The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is for classification tasks. Specifically, it was used to classify bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests. This is evident from the statement "Using bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests" where the authors mention they use a deep learning approach for ecological prediction. Furthermore, the authors compare the performance of the deep learning model with other widely used classification algorithms like distributed random forest, gradient boosting machine, and generalized linear model. Therefore, we can infer that the deep learning model here serves as a classifier.
