The given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in any particular deep learning model. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc., are crucial components of deep learning models. They are typically mentioned in the methodology or experimental setup sections of research papers or articles discussing deep learning applications. Unfortunately, none of the provided references explicitly state the hyperparameters used in their respective deep learning models. Therefore, based solely on this context, I cannot provide the requested information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
