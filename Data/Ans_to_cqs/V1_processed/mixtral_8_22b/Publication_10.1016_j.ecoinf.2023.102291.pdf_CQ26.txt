The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets, which could imply stratified splitting to maintain class proportions across datasets. Additionally, the use of different image resolutions and window sizes suggests efforts towards diverse data collection. Unfortunately, there is no mention of oversampling or undersampling techniques being employed. Therefore, while some methods may have been utilized to mitigate data bias, the exact techniques remain unclear from the given context.
