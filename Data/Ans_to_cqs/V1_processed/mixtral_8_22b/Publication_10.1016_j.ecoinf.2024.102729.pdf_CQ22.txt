Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors use several metrics to evaluate the performance of their machine learning models, specifically the Random Forest (RF) model. These metrics include adjusted R-squared (adj\_R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). However, it should be noted that these metrics are not specific to deep learning models but are commonly used for evaluating various types of regression models, including machine learning models like Random Forest.

* Adjusted R-squared (adj\_R2): This metric measures how well the predicted values fit the observed values. Unlike the regular R-squared, which increases when new predictors are added, the adjusted R-squared takes into account the number of predictors in the model and only increases if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance.
* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This metric quantifies the difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better model performance.
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Similar to RMSE, MAE also measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions. However, unlike RMSE, MAE does not penalize larger errors as heavily.
* Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE): This metric combines three components – correlation, bias, and variability – to provide a comprehensive measure of model performance. A KGE score closer to 1 indicates better model performance.
