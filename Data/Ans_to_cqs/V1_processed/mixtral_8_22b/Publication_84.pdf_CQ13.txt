In the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it does provide some details about the parameters used in the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which is also a type of machine learning algorithm. In the case of SVM, the 'kernelType' was set to 'RBF', and different values were tested for the 'gamma' and 'cost' parameters. The optimal values found were 'gamma' = 2 and 'cost' = 10.

As for the deep learning model, the context mentions that a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) was used, but it doesn't specify any particular hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it focuses on comparing the performance of SAE with SVM when using different types of Landsat images and phenological knowledge. It suggests that SAE benefited more than SVM from combining data in the two phenological stages using Phenology Profile Combination Method (Ppf-CM).

Therefore, without additional context, I cannot provide the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
