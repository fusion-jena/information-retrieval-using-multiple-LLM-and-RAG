Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the text that the PLUS model uses development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of land use data, which could potentially serve as a means to evaluate the model's performance over time. Additionally, the PLUS model employs a decreasing threshold rule for generating patch seeds, which might also contribute to monitoring the model's progress during training. Nonetheless, without further details regarding the actual implementation or evaluation metrics, it remains unclear what exact strategies are being used to monitor the model performance during training.
