The purpose of the deep learning model described in the provided context is both classification and semantic segmentation. Initially, the model is trained for classification tasks, where it learns to predict the respective plant species from input images. Afterward, the same model uses the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) technique to produce weak segmentation maps covering most parts of the plants, including flowers and leaves. These segmentation maps serve as pseudo ground truth labels for further training the model for semantic segmentation tasks. The ultimate goal of this multi-stage training process is to create a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying different plant species and generating precise segmentation masks around them within input images.
