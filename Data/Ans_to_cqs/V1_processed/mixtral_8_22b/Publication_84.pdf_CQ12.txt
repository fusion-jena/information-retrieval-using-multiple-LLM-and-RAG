The article does not explicitly mention which specific type of deep learning model is used in their pipeline. However, they do mention using an autoencoder-based deep learning approach for remote-sensing image classification. Autoencoders are a type of neural network that learns efficient codings of input data by reconstructing the input data through a bottleneck layer. They are often used for dimensionality reduction or denoising tasks but can also be applied to other problems such as anomaly detection or generative modeling. In this study, the authors use an autoencoder-based deep learning method to extract phenological features from Landsat satellite images and then apply these features to detect invasive Spartina alterniflora plants along the coastline of China.
