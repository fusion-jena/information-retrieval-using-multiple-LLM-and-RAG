The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some potential criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss on the validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss over several epochs. In the absence of explicit information, these general principles can guide our understanding of when training might typically be considered complete.
