The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of big data theory and technology, neural networks, and structural equations for data mining. These techniques often involve processing large datasets containing various types of structured or semi-structured data such as CSV files, databases, or even images and videos depending on the application. Additionally, the study focuses on understanding the impact of forest microclimates on Net Assimilation Index (NAI). This suggests that the dataset might include environmental measurements like temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, photosynthetic activity, etc. Therefore, it is likely that the data format used in this case would primarily consist of numerical data from sensors and possibly some form of spatial data related to the location of these measurements.
