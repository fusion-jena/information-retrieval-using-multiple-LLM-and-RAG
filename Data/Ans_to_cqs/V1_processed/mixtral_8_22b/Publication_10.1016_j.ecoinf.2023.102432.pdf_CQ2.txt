Based on the given context, we can infer that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, hyperspectral images are used for tree crown classification using the Multiple Instance Adaptive Cosine Estimator (MI-ACE). Additionally, other types of remote sensing images such as NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat are also mentioned in the context. However, there is no mention of other data formats like audio or video. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the data format used in this particular deep learning pipeline is primarily images.
