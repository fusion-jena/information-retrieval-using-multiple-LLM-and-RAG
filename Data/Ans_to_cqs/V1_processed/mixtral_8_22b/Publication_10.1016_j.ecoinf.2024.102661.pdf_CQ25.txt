The text does not explicitly state the specific purpose or task of the deep learning model being discussed. However, it mentions the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are typically used for sequence prediction problems such as time series forecasting, natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, speech recognition, etc. In this case, the authors mention using LSTM for forecasting purposes, specifically for predicting ACE (Accumulated Cyclone Energy) values. Therefore, we can infer that the primary purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to perform time series forecasting.

Based on the given information, the purpose of the deep learning model is to perform time series forecasting, specifically for predicting Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) values.
