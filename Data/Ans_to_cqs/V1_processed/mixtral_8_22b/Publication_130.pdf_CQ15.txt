While the given text does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), it discusses various aspects related to deep learning pipelines, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other network architectures like ResNet. In general, optimization techniques play a crucial role in improving the performance of deep learning models.

Optimization techniques help minimize the loss function during model training, enabling better predictions and improved accuracy. Some commonly used optimization techniques include:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): This method updates the weights based on the gradient of the error function calculated from a single sample. It is computationally efficient but may converge slowly.

2. Mini-batch Gradient Descent: A compromise between batch and stochastic gradient descent, where the update is performed after processing a small subset of samples called a mini-batch.

3. Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam): An extension of stochastic gradient descent that uses momentum and adaptive learning rates to improve convergence speed and stability.

4. RMSprop: Another adaptive learning rate algorithm designed to address the vanishing gradients issue in recurrent neural networks.

These optimization techniques can also involve tuning hyperparameters, such as learning rate, momentum, weight decay, etc., to achieve optimal performance. Different hyperparameter settings can lead to varying results, so experimentation is essential to find the best combination for a particular task.

Although the given text does not directly discuss optimization techniques, understanding their importance and usage is vital for implementing successful deep learning pipelines.
