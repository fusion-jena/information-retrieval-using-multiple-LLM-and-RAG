In the given context, the performance of the deep learning model is compared using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Additionally, Leave-One-Out Cross Validation is performed to check the accuracy of the spatial predictions. The model is trained on all data except one point, and a prediction is made for that point, using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model. Therefore, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
