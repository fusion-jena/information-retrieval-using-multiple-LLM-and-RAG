In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of regularization might have been implemented due to the use of transfer learning and the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture.

Transfer learning involves utilizing a pretrained model on a large dataset and fine-tuning it on a smaller, specialized dataset. By leveraging the learned features from the larger dataset, the risk of overfitting on the smaller dataset is reduced. Additionally, the ResNet-34 architecture itself has built-in mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, such as skip connections and batch normalization. These techniques help improve the generalization capabilities of the model by reducing the vanishing gradient problem and promoting faster convergence during training.

While not explicitly mentioned, other common regularization techniques could also have been employed, such as early stopping, weight decay (L2 regularization), or even dropout. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation loss during training and halting the process once the validation loss starts increasing, indicating potential overfitting. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input or hidden units to zero during training, effectively creating an ensemble of multiple thinned networks and improving overall robustness.

In summary, while the context does not provide direct evidence of specific regularization methods being used, it is likely that some combination of transfer learning, architectural design choices, and potentially additional regularization techniques were employed to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
