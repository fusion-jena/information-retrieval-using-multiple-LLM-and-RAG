In the given context, one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is mentioned - Dropout. This technique, introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014), is described as a simple yet effective way to prevent neural networks from overfitting. However, other regularization techniques such as L2 regularization are not explicitly discussed in this context. It should also be noted that while these methods can help reduce overfitting, they may not always ensure superior performance when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms like Random Forest.
