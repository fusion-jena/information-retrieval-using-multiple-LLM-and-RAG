The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the dataset for deep learning model training, such as train, test, or validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning and deep learning involve splitting the dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set.

Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is utilized during the model development process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used after the final model has been selected to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Common ratios for splitting the dataset include 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, but this can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the problem being addressed. In some cases, techniques like k-fold cross-validation may be applied instead of fixed splits.
