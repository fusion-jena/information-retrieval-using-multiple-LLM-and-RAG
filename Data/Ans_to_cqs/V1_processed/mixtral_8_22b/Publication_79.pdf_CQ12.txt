The paper uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for hierarchical classification of Brazilian Savanna physiognomies. The authors employ U-Net architecture, which is a popular choice for semantic segmentation tasks. U-Net was originally developed by Ronneberger et al. [27] and has been widely adopted due to its ability to perform well with limited training data. In this work, Neves et al. use high spatial resolution satellite data along with U-Net for semantic segmentation of Brazilian savanna vegetation [26]. Additionally, they mention using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) proposed by Long et al. [29], which are also based on CNN architectures.
