Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the purpose or type of the deep learning model used in the study. However, considering the overall theme of the text, it can be inferred that the deep learning model might have been used for estimating or predicting water quality parameters (WQP), specifically chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations. This assumption is made because the context mentions other machine learning models being used for similar purposes, such as the SVM model by Li et al. and the OGN model by Muhammad et al. Furthermore, the context discusses various WQP inversion algorithms, including deep learning algorithms, suggesting that they may have been utilized for the same goal. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the deep learning model mentioned in the context, it cannot be definitively stated what its exact purpose was (classification, segmentation, detection, etc.).
