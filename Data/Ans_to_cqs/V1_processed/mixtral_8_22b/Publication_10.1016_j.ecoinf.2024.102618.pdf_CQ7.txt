The context provided does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, typically, datasets are divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during training. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model on unseen data. Common splitting ratios include 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing or 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Other methods such as k-fold cross-validation can be employed to ensure robustness and generalization of the model.
