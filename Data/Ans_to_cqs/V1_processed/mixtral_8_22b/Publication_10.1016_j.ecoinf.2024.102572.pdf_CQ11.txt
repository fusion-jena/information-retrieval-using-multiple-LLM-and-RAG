The given context does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the research. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it mentions that the obtained data is saved in "CSV" format on Google Drive for later examination. It also refers to a dataset with comprehensive aboveground biomass data, whose standard errors are thoroughly delineated in the official documentation available at <https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084>. Unfortunately, this information does not directly address the query regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
