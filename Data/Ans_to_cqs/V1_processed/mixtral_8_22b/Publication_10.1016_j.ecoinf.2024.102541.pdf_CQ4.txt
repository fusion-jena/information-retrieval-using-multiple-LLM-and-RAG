The paper does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be assumed that they might have employed some standard data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, or color space transformations to improve the robustness and generalizability of their models. These techniques help prevent overfitting by artificially increasing the size of the training set and introducing variations in the input data.

Based on the given context, we cannot provide a definitive list of the exact data augmentation techniques used in this study. It would require further clarification from the authors or access to more detailed information about their methodology.
