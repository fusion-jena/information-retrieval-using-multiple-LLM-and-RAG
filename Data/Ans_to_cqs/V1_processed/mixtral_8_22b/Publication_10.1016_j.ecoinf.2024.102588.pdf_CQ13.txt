The deep learning model used in this study is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an optional autoencoder. The learning rate was initially set to 0.001 but was automatically adjusted during training to find the optimum point for the best performance of the CNN model. The optimizer used in the model was the Adam optimizer. Other hyperparameters such as batch size or number of epochs are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
