The text does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and computer vision, some possible data annotation techniques could include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest in images, while semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class label. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation by identifying individual instances of objects and their boundaries. Without more specific details, it cannot be determined which technique was used in this particular study.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors used transfer learning with a pre-trained EfficientNet B0 network for feature extraction. They froze the original feature extractor and only updated the weights of the final dense classification layers during training. The audio data was input to the network in a novel spectrogram representation. It is unclear what type of data annotation techniques were used in this study, but based on common practices in machine learning and computer vision, some possibilities could include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation.
