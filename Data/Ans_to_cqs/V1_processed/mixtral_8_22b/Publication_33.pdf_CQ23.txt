The text does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest efforts have been made to improve the model's performance and applicability.

Firstly, the authors use two separate databases, T0 and T1, during different phases of the process. The initial phase involves building a classification model by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the T0 database. Subsequently, the second phase focuses on tuning a risk threshold specific to each class using the independent T1 database. By employing distinct datasets for these stages, the researchers aim to enhance the model's adaptability and prevent overfitting.

Secondly, the authors discuss adjusting species thresholds to regulate the trade-off between classification robustness and coverage. This approach allows them to customize the model based on the user's requirements, making it more versatile and applicable across various scenarios.

Lastly, the paper mentions providing robust estimates of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), which implies that the model has been designed to deliver reliable results even when dealing with large and complex datasets. Although the text does not detail the exact methods employed to achieve this, it suggests that the researchers have considered the need for generalizability while developing their deep learning algorithm.
