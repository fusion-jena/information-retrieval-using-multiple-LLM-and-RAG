The text does not provide specific details about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification. Specifically, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) type of ANN is employed, which performs backpropagation of training samples to accurately classify LULC. While ANNs are a form of deep learning models, they do not fall under the categories of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that the pipeline uses an ANN, specifically an MLP, but no further details regarding other types of deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers are mentioned.
