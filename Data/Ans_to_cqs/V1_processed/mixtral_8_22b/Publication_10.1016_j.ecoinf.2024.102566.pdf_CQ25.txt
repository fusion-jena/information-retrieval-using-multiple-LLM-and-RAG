The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model might be related to estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB) or biomass in general. The authors mention employing a method that integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation due to the insufficiency of high-quality training samples. This suggests that they may have developed a deep learning model to estimate biomass from these combined datasets. Without more specific details about the model architecture or its intended task (such as regression, classification, etc.), it cannot be definitively determined what type of deep learning model was used.
