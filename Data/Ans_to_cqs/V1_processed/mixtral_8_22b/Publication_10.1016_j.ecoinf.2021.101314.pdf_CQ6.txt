Before training a deep learning model, various preprocessing steps may be applied depending on the specific requirements of the dataset and the problem being addressed. Some commonly used preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant data points, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies within the dataset.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Scaling numerical input features so they fall within a similar range, which helps improve convergence during optimization. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling, Z-score standardization, and unit norm scaling.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on domain knowledge or transforming existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. Examples include polynomial feature expansion, binarizing categorical variables, and encoding textual information into numeric representations.

4. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of input features through techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). These methods help reduce computational costs and mitigate potential issues related to high dimensionality, such as overfitting.

5. Data Augmentation: Generating additional synthetic samples by applying random transformations to the original data, thereby increasing the diversity of the training set and improving generalization performance.

6. Splitting Datasets: Dividing the available data into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing purposes. This allows for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data and fine-tuning hyperparameters accordingly.
