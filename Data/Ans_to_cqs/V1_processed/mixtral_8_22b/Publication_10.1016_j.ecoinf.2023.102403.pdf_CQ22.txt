The given context does not provide any information about the use or evaluation of a deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which specific metrics were used to evaluate the performance of such a model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help measure how well the model performs in predicting outcomes or classifying data. Without further context, I cannot specify which metrics were used in evaluating the performance of a deep learning model.
