The article does not provide explicit information about the data format used in the deep learning pipeline for improving cloud detection with machine learning. However, it can be inferred from the context that the primary data source is satellite imagery, specifically from the Sentinel-2 mission. Therefore, it is likely that the data format used in this case would be images or raster datasets. This assumption is supported by the fact that the article discusses the growth of the Sentinel-2 image database and compares wetland use intensity between different time steps using Earth observation data. Additionally, the keywords listed include 'Sentinel-2', which further suggests that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is related to satellite imagery.
