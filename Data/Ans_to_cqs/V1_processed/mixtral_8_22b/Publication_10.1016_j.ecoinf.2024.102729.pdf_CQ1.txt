Based on the given context, it appears that various methods are employed for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These include conventional on-site sampling, which involves physically gathering samples from the environment, and remote sensing techniques such as satellite imagery or drone footage. Additionally, acoustic sensors have been mentioned as another potential source of data collection. Public datasets may also be utilized, although this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. It should be noted that each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method will depend on factors such as the specific research question being addressed, the availability of resources, and the desired level of accuracy and precision. For example, while conventional on-site sampling can provide highly accurate measurements, it can also be time-consuming and expensive. On the other hand, remote sensing techniques offer greater coverage and efficiency but may sacrifice some degree of accuracy. Ultimately, the most appropriate method or combination of methods will need to be determined based on the unique requirements of each individual study.
