The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the models were evaluated based on their performance using various metrics like precision, recall, and F-measure. Additionally, the context mentions that the models displayed a slight variation in F-measure standard deviation, which could suggest that some form of model stability or convergence was considered during training. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the training process, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
