To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors used diverse datasets and performed various tests such as 'test-over\_time' and 'test-over\_location'. They reported achieving exceptional results with F1 scores above 0.934 on both training and validation data. Furthermore, they tested the model on unseen locations ('test-over\_location') where it obtained near-perfect F1 scores of 0.985, 1, and 1. This suggests that the model can accurately identify nesting sites even when applied to new geographical areas. Additionally, the model demonstrated strong temporal consistency by maintaining high performance levels across different time periods ('test-over\_time'). These findings indicate that the model has been successfully trained to handle variations in both space and time, thereby enhancing its overall robustness and applicability.
