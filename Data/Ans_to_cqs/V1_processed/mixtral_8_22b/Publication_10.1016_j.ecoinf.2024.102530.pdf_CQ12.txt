Based on the given information, it appears that no deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers were explicitly mentioned or used in the described pipeline. Instead, the authors utilized a tree-based Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) model for their analysis. The FIS model consists of multiple interconnected sub-models arranged in a cascading structure, which takes inputs from previous subsystems and produces outputs for subsequent ones. The specific implementation uses Matlab 2023b's fuzzy logic toolbox to create the FIS models. Therefore, based on the available information, there is no indication that a deep learning model was employed in the pipeline.
