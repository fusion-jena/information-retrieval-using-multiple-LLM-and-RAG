Based on the given context, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, they created their own dataset for training and testing purposes. They collected a total of 5664 tree samples through various methods like rotation, mirroring, and flipping to perform data augmentation. These samples were then used for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training. Additionally, scattered samples (627) and tree samples (304) in 12 plots surveyed during field measurements were utilized for test and tree species classification accuracy assessment. A total of 931 test tree samples were used for this purpose. Furthermore, the same 12 plots were used for diversity mapping assessment. Therefore, based on the information provided, no standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were used; instead, custom datasets were generated for the deep learning pipeline.
