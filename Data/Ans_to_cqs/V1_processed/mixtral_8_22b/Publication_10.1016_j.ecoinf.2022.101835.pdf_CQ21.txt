After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model Evaluation: This involves calculating various metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R^2), etc., to assess the performance of the trained model. These metrics help in understanding how well the model has learned from the given dataset and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Hyperparameter Optimization: After initializing the model with some default hyperparameters, it may be necessary to fine-tune these parameters to achieve better results. Techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc., can be employed to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.

3. Feature Importance Analysis: To understand which features contribute most significantly towards predicting the target variable, feature importance analysis can be carried out. Methods like Permutation Importance, Gini Importance, SHAP Values, etc., can provide insights into the contribution of individual features.

4. Visualizations: Various visualizations like Saliency Maps, GradCAM, LIME, etc., can be generated to interpret the predictions made by the model. These visualizations highlight important regions in the input space that influence the final prediction, thereby providing valuable insights into the working of the model.

5. Ensemble Models: Combining multiple models to form an ensemble can often lead to improved performance compared to individual models. Techniques like Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, etc., can be applied to create ensembles of different types of models.

In this particular case, after training the RF, ANN, and LightGBM models, the authors have performed hyperparameter optimization using Optuna library. They have also calculated MAE, R^2, and Loss Function (Mean Squared Error) to evaluate the performance of their models. Additionally, they have computed SHAP values to analyze the impact of individual features on the predicted outputs.
