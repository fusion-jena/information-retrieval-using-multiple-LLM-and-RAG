The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, there are some implicit strategies mentioned that help manage variability and improve performance. These include:

1. Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent: This optimization strategy helps reduce variance in the updates by averaging over multiple examples. It introduces some level of randomness through sampling batches but ensures more stable convergence than pure stochastic gradient descent.

2. Dropout Regularization: By randomly dropping units from the neural network during training, dropout regularization prevents overfitting and improves generalization. This introduces another layer of randomness into the process, which ultimately leads to better overall performance.

3. Data Augmentation: While not explicitly stated as a means to handle randomness, data augmentation involves applying various transformations to the input data, effectively increasing its size and diversity. This can be seen as introducing controlled randomness to the training process, helping the model become more robust and accurate.

Although these strategies do not directly address managing specific sources of randomness like random seed values, they collectively contribute to creating a more robust and reliable deep learning pipeline.
