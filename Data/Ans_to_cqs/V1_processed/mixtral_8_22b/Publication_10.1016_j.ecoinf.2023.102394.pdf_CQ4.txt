Data augmentation techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, common data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting by introducing variations into the existing data. For instance, image flipping can create new images by horizontally or vertically reversing the original ones. Rotation involves rotating the input images by a certain degree, while scaling changes their sizes. Cropping removes parts of the images, and zooming magnifies specific areas. Shearing distorts the images along one axis, and brightness adjustment alters the overall lightness or darkness of the inputs.
