The text does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a subset of features is selected on each iteration (tree) and that a random selection of a part of the data is made without resampling. These methods could potentially help mitigate data bias, but they are not explicitly mentioned as techniques for addressing data bias. Other common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, which are not discussed in this context.
