The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the deep learning model. CNNs are a subset of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) specifically designed for image classification tasks and pattern recognition. They have the advantage of performing automated feature extraction, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The CNN architecture consists of three types of layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are responsible for applying hierarchical feature extraction and decomposition of input images. Pooling layers help reduce the number of parameters and required computations. Fully connected layers perform the final classification step at the end of the pipeline.
