The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning model or its purpose. However, generally speaking, deep learning models can be used for various purposes such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, natural language processing tasks like text generation, translation, sentiment analysis, etc. Without further details about the specific deep learning model mentioned in the paper, we cannot determine its exact purpose.

Based on the provided context, this study focuses on using different machine learning algorithms, including regression techniques and tree-based ensemble methods, to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests. These algorithms include Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forests (RF). The results show that integrating spectral bands with other variable sets, such as those produced from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and vegetation-derived indices, leads to better outcomes when predicting AGB. Therefore, the purpose of these machine learning models is to accurately estimate AGB in forests by utilizing remote sensing data and other relevant features.
