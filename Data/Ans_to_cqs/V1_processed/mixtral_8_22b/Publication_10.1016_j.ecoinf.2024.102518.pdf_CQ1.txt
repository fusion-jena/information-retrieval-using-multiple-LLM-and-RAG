The given context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common methods for collecting raw data include surveys, sensors, and using publicly available datasets. Surveys involve gathering data through questionnaires or interviews, while sensors collect data from various sources such as cameras, microphones, or other devices. Public datasets refer to pre-existing collections of data that researchers can use for their studies. These datasets may be obtained from government agencies, research institutions, or online repositories. It is important to note that the choice of method depends on the nature of the problem being addressed and the availability of resources.
