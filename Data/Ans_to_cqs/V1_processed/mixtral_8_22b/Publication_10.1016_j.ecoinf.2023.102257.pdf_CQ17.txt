The text does not provide information about specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that modern machine learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks, can be used for tasks like identifying whether an animal is present in an image. These methods may employ various regularization techniques, such as dropout and L2 regularization, to improve their generalization capabilities and avoid overfitting. Dropout involves randomly dropping out neurons during training to reduce co-dependencies among them, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights, encouraging smaller weight values and thus simpler models. Other common regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization.
