The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping. However, it mentions the use of satellite imagery and the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which suggests that the datasets could include satellite or aerial image datasets. The authors also reference previous works such as Zhu et al.'s So2Sat LCZ42 dataset, which is a benchmark dataset for global Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification. Additionally, they mention the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data in their deep learning fusion network. Therefore, while the exact datasets used are not specified, we can infer that the researchers likely utilized satellite or aerial image datasets along with relevant indices like NDVI for their deep learning pipeline.
