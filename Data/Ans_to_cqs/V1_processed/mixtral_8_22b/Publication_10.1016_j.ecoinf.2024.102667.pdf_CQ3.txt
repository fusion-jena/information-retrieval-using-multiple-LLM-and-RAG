Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the land use/cover dataset for China was acquired from RESDC and includes land use/cover information spanning several years. This dataset was created through a combination of manual and automated interpretation and on-site data validation. Additionally, the boundary datasets for ecological engineering are sourced from the National Ecological Science Data Center. Unfortunately, without more specific information regarding the deep learning pipeline or any mention of bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other data annotation techniques, I cannot provide a helpful answer to your query based solely on the provided context.
