Based on the given context, there is no direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some related techniques mentioned include hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, post-classification processing like segmentation and filtering, and dealing with the geometry of training data. These strategies help enhance the performance and accuracy of models but do not directly address the issue of managing randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
