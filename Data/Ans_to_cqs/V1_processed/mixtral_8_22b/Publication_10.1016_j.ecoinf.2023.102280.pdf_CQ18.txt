The text does not explicitly mention the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does discuss some aspects related to training and evaluating models. It mentions that deep noise reduction techniques are trained, which implies that some form of performance monitoring would be necessary during training. Additionally, it notes that evaluation metrics are used to tune these methods, suggesting that these metrics might be part of the strategy to monitor model performance. Furthermore, the text highlights the importance of collecting clean data and creating noisy versions for training purposes, indicating that the quality and representativeness of the training data could impact model performance. Lastly, it points out that data augmentation techniques like superimposing noise samples should be considered, especially since bioacoustic applications often have abundant noise features. This suggests that managing and utilizing noise effectively could play a role in maintaining good model performance.
