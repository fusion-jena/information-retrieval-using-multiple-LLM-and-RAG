The information provided does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models discussed in the given context. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. Without further specific details about the training process mentioned in the context, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
