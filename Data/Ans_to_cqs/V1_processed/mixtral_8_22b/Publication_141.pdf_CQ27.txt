Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some details regarding the development environment and tools used during the training process.

The implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier was carried out using Python programming language along with Keras, a high-level deep learning library, and TensorFlow as the backend engine. This setup suggests that the model could be deployed using these same libraries or other compatible platforms like Google Cloud AI Platform, AWS SageMaker, etc.

Furthermore, the use of GPU execution indicates that the model might have been developed and optimized for hardware accelerators, implying potential deployment on systems equipped with GPUs for faster predictions.

However, without specific information on the actual deployment process, such as model serialization, platform selection, or API creation, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
