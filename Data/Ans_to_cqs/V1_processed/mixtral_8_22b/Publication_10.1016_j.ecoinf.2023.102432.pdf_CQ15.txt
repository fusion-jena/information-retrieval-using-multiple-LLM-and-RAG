The given context does not provide information about any specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Instead, it discusses two different approaches for remote sensing classification - MTMI-SMF and Random Forest.

MTMI-SMF stands for Multiple Training Metrics Integrated Spectral Mixture Fractional Analysis. It is designed to handle imperfect data and works by grouping pixels surrounding a training location that could potentially include an invasive species. This method is more flexible than traditional machine learning algorithms that typically rely on a single pixel to represent a training location. MTMI-SMF also has computational advantages due to its use of simple matrix multiplication.

On the other hand, Random Forest is a popular machine learning technique used for classification tasks. Unlike MTMI-SMF, Random Forest requires a single pixel's spectrum to be associated with a single metadata record. When dealing with training locations that do not align perfectly with image pixels, a random pixel from the nearest pixels is chosen for analysis. The dataset is then divided into training and testing sets using 5-fold cross-validation, and the TreeBagger function in MATLAB is employed to perform the classification using 100 decision trees.

In summary, while both methods are useful for remote sensing classification, they do not directly address the query regarding optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines like SGD or Adam.
