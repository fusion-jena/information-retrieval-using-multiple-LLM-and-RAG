The text does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does mention that a ResNet50 model was utilized, which had been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This implies that transfer learning was applied, where a model trained on one task is adapted to another related task. In this case, the pre-trained model was fine-tuned for spectrogram classification. Additionally, the text suggests that the researchers focused on maintaining high accuracy while improving prediction efficiency and reducing memory requirements, which could involve adjusting various hyperparameters. Nonetheless, without explicit details regarding these aspects, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in their deep learning model.
