The paper does not provide information on where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the authors used a balanced, open-access, global dataset of vegetation plots from sPlotOpen, but it does not specify where this dataset can be accessed or downloaded. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
