Based on the given context, it does not appear that a deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer is used in the pipeline. Instead, the context mentions the use of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with elastic-net regularization and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with null-space penalization. These are both traditional machine learning techniques rather than deep learning approaches. Therefore, there is no clear indication of any specific deep learning model being employed in this case.
