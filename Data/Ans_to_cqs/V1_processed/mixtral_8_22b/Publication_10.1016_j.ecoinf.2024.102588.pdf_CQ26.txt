The given context does not provide specific details on addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions two techniques used in the deep learning pipeline to improve feature extraction and reduce overfitting: batch normalization and dropout layers.

Batch normalization is used to perform feature generalization of the input mini-batch by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the batch normalization layer. This helps avoid covariate shifts and improves the performance of the deep learning model. Dropout layers are employed to reduce overfitting by randomly inactivating nodes containing learnable weights. These techniques help enhance the overall performance of the deep learning model but do not directly address data bias during preprocessing.

To specifically tackle data bias during preprocessing, one could consider employing various strategies like stratified splitting, which ensures that the distribution of classes in both the train and test sets remain similar to the original dataset. Oversampling and undersampling techniques can be applied to balance datasets with imbalanced classes. Additionally, collecting diverse data can also aid in reducing data bias and improving the robustness of the deep learning model.
