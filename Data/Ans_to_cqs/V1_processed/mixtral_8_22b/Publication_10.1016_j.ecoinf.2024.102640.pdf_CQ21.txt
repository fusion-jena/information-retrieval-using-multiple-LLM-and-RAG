The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., and creating confusion matrices. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained models.

In this case, it is mentioned that during the training of EPDNet, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function was employed, and the Adam optimizer was used with a learning rate of 0.0001. Additionally, the R2 metric was utilized to assess the model's fit to the observed data. This suggests that evaluating the model using these methods might be part of the postprocessing steps. However, without more specific details, it cannot be confirmed whether these were indeed the postprocessing steps taken after the model training.
