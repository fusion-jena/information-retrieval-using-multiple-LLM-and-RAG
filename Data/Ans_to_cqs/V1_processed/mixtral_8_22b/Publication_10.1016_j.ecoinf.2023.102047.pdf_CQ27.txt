Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, I can share some general steps typically involved in deploying a deep learning model:

1. Model Serialization: After training the deep learning model, it needs to be saved for later use. This involves converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded efficiently. Common formats include pickle files (for Python),.h5 files (for Keras), or ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format.

2. Platform Selection: Once the model is serialized, it must be deployed onto a platform where it can receive input data and generate predictions. Depending on the application requirements, this could range from edge devices like mobile phones or IoT devices, to cloud servers, or even specialized hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs.

3. Inference Engine: A software component called an 'inference engine' is required to load the serialized model and execute it on new input data. Examples of popular inference engines include TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, and OpenVINO.

4. API Development: For applications to interact with the deployed model, APIs need to be created. These APIs enable users or other systems to send requests containing input data to the model and receive the corresponding output predictions.

5. Monitoring & Maintenance: Post-deployment, it's essential to monitor the model's performance continuously and maintain it regularly. This includes tracking metrics like latency, throughput, and accuracy, as well as updating the model periodically with fresh training data.
