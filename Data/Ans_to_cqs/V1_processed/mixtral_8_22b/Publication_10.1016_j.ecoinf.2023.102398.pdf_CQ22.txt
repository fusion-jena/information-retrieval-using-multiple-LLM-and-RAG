The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as precision (P), recall (R), mean average precision (mAP), and the F1-score. Precision measures the ratio of true predictions to the total number of predictions made by the model. Recall calculates the proportion of true predictions out of all actual instances present in the data. The F1-score combines both precision and recall into a single metric, providing a balanced evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, mAP is employed to assess the overall accuracy of the machine learning algorithm. These metrics are computed using specific formulas based on True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN).
