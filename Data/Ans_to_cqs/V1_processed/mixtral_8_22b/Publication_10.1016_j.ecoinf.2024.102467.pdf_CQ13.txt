Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it mentions that EfficientNetV2 utilizes an improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size. Additionally, it discusses how the EfficientNetV2 series focuses on reducing the number of parameters and computations while maintaining the accuracy of the model, resulting in significant improvements in training and inference durations compared to previous networks.

For more detailed information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, one would need to refer to the original research papers or source code related to EfficientNetV2. Some common hyperparameters found in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, epochs, weight decay, momentum, and dropout rate. These values can greatly impact the performance and convergence of the model during training.
