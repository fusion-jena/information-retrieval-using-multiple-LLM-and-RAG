The text does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions the use of detailed labels associated with the NIPS4Bplus dataset and automatic detailed labels generated with a noise filtering algorithm for the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset. These could be considered forms of data annotation. Additionally, the text discusses the use of active learning to enhance and facilitate the labor-intensive process of data generation, which involves selecting those samples most likely to improve model performance from predictions that a model generates over unlabeled data. This iterative process reduces the extent of manual annotation required. Therefore, while the exact methods of data annotation are not specified, the text implies the use of various techniques to label and annotate data within the deep learning pipeline.
