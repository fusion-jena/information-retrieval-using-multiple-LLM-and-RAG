The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of two types of public datasets for validating the network: the Plant Village dataset and the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset. These datasets are likely collected using various methods such as image capturing or sensor readings, but the exact collection process is not detailed in the given context. Therefore, based on the available information, we can only infer that public datasets are one source of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline.
