The text does not provide information on which specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the scikit-learn library was used for implementing the machine learning models, including the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF) models. Scikit-learn is a popular Python library for machine learning but is not typically associated with building deep learning models. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine which deep learning framework was used to build the model.
