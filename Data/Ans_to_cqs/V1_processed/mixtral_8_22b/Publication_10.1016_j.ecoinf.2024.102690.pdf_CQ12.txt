The pipeline uses an unsupervised learning neural network approach called Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM). This method combines dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to allocate research units into different ecosystem service bundles based on spatial similarities. In this case, the SOFM was implemented using the R package 'kohonen'. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is not a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, but rather a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM).
