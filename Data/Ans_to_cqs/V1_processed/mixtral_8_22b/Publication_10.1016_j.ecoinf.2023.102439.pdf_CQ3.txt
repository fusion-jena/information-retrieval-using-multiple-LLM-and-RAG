Based on the given context, it appears there isn't any direct information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we do see that the research involves utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for modeling purposes.

In general, data annotation refers to the process of labeling raw data so that algorithms can learn from it. For example, in image recognition tasks, bounding boxes might be drawn around objects of interest, which helps the algorithm understand what those objects look like. Instance segmentation is another technique where each pixel of an object is labeled individually, providing more detailed information.

While these specific techniques aren't mentioned in the provided context, they could potentially be part of the broader methodology if images were being used as part of the dataset. But without explicit mention, we cannot confirm their usage in this particular case.
