The authors utilized data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of their deep learning classification model. They employed the fastai library's get_transforms function with specific arguments to achieve this goal. The applied data augmentation techniques include:

1. Vertical flipping of images: This is done by setting flip_vert = TRUE. It allows the model to learn features invariant to image orientation.

2. Limiting overexposure: By specifying max_lighting = 0.02, they prevented the images from being excessively exposed during the augmentation process. This helps maintain the quality of the input data.

3. Disabling zooming augmentation: Setting max_zoom = 1 disables any zooming augmentation, ensuring that the original scale of the images remains intact.

4. Reducing GPU memory load: Using to_fp16 = TRUE reduces the memory load on the graphical processing unit (GPU) by converting the tensors to half-precision floating point format.

These data augmentation techniques contribute to improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of the deep learning model.
