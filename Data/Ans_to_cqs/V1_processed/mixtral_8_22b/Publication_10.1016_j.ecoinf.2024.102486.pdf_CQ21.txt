The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention that no posterior samples were removed via thinning, as the resulting file sizes still allowed for fast post-processing. It also mentions that convergence was assessed using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic. Additionally, Gaussian kernel density estimation was used to visualize posterior marginal distributions. These details suggest that some form of statistical analysis and visualization might be part of the postprocessing steps. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is impossible to determine if saliency maps, metrics calculations, confusion matrices, or other techniques would be appropriate postprocessing steps for this particular case.
