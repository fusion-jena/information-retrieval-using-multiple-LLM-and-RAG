The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that various data formats have been employed in different studies. For instance, reference [23] discusses sequence-to-sequence learning with neural networks, which could involve text or time series data. Reference [25] focuses on deep residual learning for image recognition, indicating the use of image data. Similarly, reference [26] mentions very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, further emphasizing the use of image data. References [20], [21], and [22] pertain to speech recognition, suggesting the utilization of audio data. Lastly, reference [46] introduces ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database, reinforcing the application of image data in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, while the exact data formats used in the mentioned deep learning pipeline remain unknown, it is evident that various formats such as text, time series, image, and audio data have been utilized in similar contexts.
