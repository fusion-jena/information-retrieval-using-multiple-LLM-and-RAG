The text does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it is implied that the data format used is primarily image data. This is evident when the authors mention using 'annotated images' for training their deep learning models and applying them to 'new datasets for automatic classification.' Additionally, they discuss using 'aerial imagery,' suggesting that the input data consists of visual images captured from above. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
