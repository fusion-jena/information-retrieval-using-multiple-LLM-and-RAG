The papers mentioned in the given context primarily focus on various aspects of deep learning applications in fisheries research, such as fish length and catch number monitoring, fish identification, and biomass estimation. However, they do not explicitly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines.

Data annotation techniques play a crucial role in developing accurate machine learning models, especially when dealing with image or video datasets. Commonly used techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These methods help create labeled datasets required for supervised learning tasks like object detection and classification.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within an image, which helps train models to detect and localize these objects. Semantic segmentation assigns each pixel in an image to a class label, enabling models to understand the overall scene better. Instance segmentation combines both approaches, allowing models to differentiate between individual instances of the same class.

While the papers referenced here may have employed one or more of these techniques during their research, they did not provide explicit details about their chosen data annotation strategies. To determine the exact techniques used in these studies, it would be necessary to consult the original publications or contact the authors directly.
