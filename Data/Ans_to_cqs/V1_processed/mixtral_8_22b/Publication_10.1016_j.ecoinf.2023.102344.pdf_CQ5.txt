The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that raw bivalve images were used as inputs to optimize pre-trained networks such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. These networks have been previously trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, but the specific dataset used for optimization in this case is not mentioned. Additionally, the table lists various studies that use different datasets, including micro-CT scanning image analysis of fossil and shelly invertebrates, common cockle harvest origin, and cephalopod species identification. However, without more context or explicit mention of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it is difficult to determine the exact datasets employed.
