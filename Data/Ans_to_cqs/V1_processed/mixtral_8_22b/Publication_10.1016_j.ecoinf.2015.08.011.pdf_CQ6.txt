Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, some common practices can still be discussed. Preprocessing steps often involve handling missing values, outliers, and noise in the dataset. Normalization and scaling techniques help bring all features to a similar scale, improving convergence during optimization. Cleaning involves removing irrelevant data points or correcting inconsistencies. Additionally, splitting the dataset into training and validation/testing sets is crucial to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Early stopping is also mentioned as a technique to halt training once the model starts overfitting.
