Throughout the training process, the algorithm monitors the model performance by going through cycles of training on the training set and then evaluating performance on the validation set. This allows the model to adjust its node weights based on the feedback received from the validation set. The goal is to find the optimal number of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets starts to diverge due to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too specialized at predicting the training set while losing its ability to accurately predict new, unseen data. By monitoring the performance on both the training and validation sets, the model can strike a balance between fitting the training data and maintaining its ability to generalize to new data.
