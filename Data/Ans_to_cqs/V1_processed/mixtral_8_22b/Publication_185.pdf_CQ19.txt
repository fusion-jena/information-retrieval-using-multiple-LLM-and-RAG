Based on the given information, the deep learning model was built using the Caffe framework. This is mentioned when discussing the training process of the model, where it states that the model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe. Therefore, no other specific framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch is explicitly mentioned in this context.
