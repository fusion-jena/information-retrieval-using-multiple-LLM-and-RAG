Based on the given context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is Dropout. In the context, it is mentioned that the deep learning model includes Dropout layers with a certain Dropout Rate. These Dropout layers help in preventing overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training, thus reducing the co-dependency among them. Although other regularization techniques like L2 regularization could also be used, they are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, based on the information provided, Dropout is the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in this particular case.
