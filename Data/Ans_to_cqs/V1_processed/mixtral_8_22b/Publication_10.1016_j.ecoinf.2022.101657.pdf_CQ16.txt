Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, typically, in machine learning models like the one mentioned here, common criteria to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. In this case, since the model uses transfer learning from a pre-trained model and achieves a credible mean average precision (mAP50) score of 0.75, it can be assumed that the training process was stopped based on achieving satisfactory performance on the validation set.
