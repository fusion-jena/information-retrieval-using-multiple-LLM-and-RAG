The performance of the deep learning models in this context is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated for each taxonomic rank (Order, Family, and Species) and averaged across multiple runs of the models. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives in the data. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both aspects of classification performance. In addition, the standard deviations of these metrics are also reported to indicate the variability in performance across different runs of the models.
