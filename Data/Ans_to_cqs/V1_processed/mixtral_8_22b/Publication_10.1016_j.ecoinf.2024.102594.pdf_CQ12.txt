The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called DeepLabV3+. It is specifically employed for semantic segmentation tasks. The DeepLabV3+ model incorporates dilated convolutions during its encoding phase, expanding the receptive field without loss of information. Additionally, it utilizes an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module with dilated convolution to effectively integrate multi-scale information. During the decoding phase, it improves boundary segmentation accuracy by combining low-level features with high-level ones.
