The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it is used for predicting oil palm yields based on various agronomic parameters such as soil composition, climatic conditions, plant age, and farming techniques. The deep learning algorithm mentioned is Deep Neural Networks, which could be utilized for regression tasks like yield prediction. Therefore, the primary objective of employing deep learning here is to create a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting oil palm yields, contributing to efficient crop management, supply chain optimization, and sustainable farming practices.
