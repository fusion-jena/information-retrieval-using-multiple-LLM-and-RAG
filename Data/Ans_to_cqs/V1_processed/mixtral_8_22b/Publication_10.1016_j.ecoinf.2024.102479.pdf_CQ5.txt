Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that the dataset consists of 138 ground-based AGB (aboveground biomass) estimates after eliminating outliers. This dataset was then divided into two parts - 70% for model training and 30% for testing purposes. Therefore, the dataset used in this case appears to be related to estimating aboveground biomass rather than common image classification tasks like those found in MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets.
