Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any specific details about the application of data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, etc., are commonly used in image processing tasks within deep learning pipelines to artificially expand the size of the training set by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. These techniques help improve the performance and generalization capabilities of machine learning models. However, since no mention of such techniques is made in the provided context, I cannot provide a detailed response on this topic based on the available information.
