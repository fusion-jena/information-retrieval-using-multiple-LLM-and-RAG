The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the model serves a classification function. This is because the model is used to classify areas as either 'unsuitable' or'suitable' based on certain criteria. Specifically, the model uses an ensemble approach combining Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) components to predict current and future suitable areas for different groups of orchids under land cover and climate change scenarios. The model is trained with 80% of the data for each category of orchids and validated using metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS), which are commonly used for evaluating binary classification models. Therefore, the primary purpose of the deep learning model in this study appears to be the classification of suitable habitats for various types of orchids under changing environmental conditions.
