To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, the authors took several measures. Firstly, they used data augmentation techniques such as vertical and horizontal flipping of patches with a probability of 0.5. This helped increase the diversity of the dataset by creating new samples from existing ones. Secondly, they mentioned the possibility of extending the dataset further by including more examples under different conditions like varying daylight conditions or different year seasons. They also acknowledged that increasing the depth of the convolutional neural network (CNN) might lead to overfitting due to increased model capacity. Instead, they suggested improving the current work by incorporating more diverse examples in the dataset. However, the paper does not explicitly mention any specific methods such as cross-validation or stratified splitting for ensuring the robustness and generalizability of the model.
