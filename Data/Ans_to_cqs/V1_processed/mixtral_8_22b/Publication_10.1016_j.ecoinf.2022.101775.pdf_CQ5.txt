The given context does not provide specific details about the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. The authors mention training algorithms with the amount of data available but do not specify which dataset it is. They also discuss the use of matrix factorization techniques like Deep Matrix Factorization (DMF) for handling data from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), but no explicit reference to any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet is made. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
