Unfortunately, based on the given context, it does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources mentioned in the context primarily focus on research papers related to machine learning, vegetation studies, satellite monitoring, and other related topics. None of them explicitly mention a specific data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
