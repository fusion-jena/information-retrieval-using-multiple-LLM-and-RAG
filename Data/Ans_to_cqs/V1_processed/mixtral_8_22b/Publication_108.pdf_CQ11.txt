Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to any data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly for further clarification regarding the availability of their deep learning pipeline in public data repositories.
