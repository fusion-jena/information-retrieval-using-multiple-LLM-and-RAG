The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss some aspects related to preparing data for machine learning models, particularly Random Forest (RF)-based Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping.

In the context, there is a discussion about addressing the issue of unbalanced training data using various sampling techniques like undersampling, oversampling, and combinations of both. It also mentions a hexagonal random-sampling strategy along with a tile model used to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping.

Additionally, the text highlights the use of image presegmentation, which helps retain the benefits of object-based classification while avoiding time-consuming parameter adjustments required by traditional segmentation methods. The proposed method is implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, allowing easy application to other regions or different study years.

While these points do not directly relate to preprocessing steps for deep learning models, they provide insights into how data preparation might look for certain applications. For instance, dealing with imbalanced classes and selecting appropriate features are common considerations when working with machine learning models.

As for general preprocessing steps often involved before training a deep learning model, these typically include:

1. Data Cleaning: Removing irrelevant, redundant, or corrupted data from the dataset.
2. Normalization: Scaling numeric columns to a standard scale so that no feature dominates the others. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling and z-score normalization.
3. Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features that contribute most to the prediction variable or outcome.
4. Handling Missing Values: Imputing missing values using statistical measures or predictive models.
5. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical form, e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding.
