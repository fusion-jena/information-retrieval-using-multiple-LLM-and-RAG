Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, some aspects mentioned could contribute to improving the model's generalization capabilities indirectly.

Firstly, the study proposes a new model called SeedNet, which consists of six learnable layers, five of them being convolutional, and the last one being fully connected. This design allows the model to extract relevant features from images effectively. Additionally, ReLU activation function is applied after each convolutional layer, enabling nonlinearity and preventing vanishing gradient problems.

Secondly, max pooling layers are inserted between consecutive convolutional layers to downsample feature maps, reducing computational complexity and controlling overfitting. By doing so, the model becomes more resilient to variations in the data, thus enhancing its ability to generalize better.

Lastly, the model uses a diverse dataset containing different classes of seeds, specifically 6 classes for the Canadian dataset and 23 classes for the local dataset. Although not explicitly stated, this diversity might help improve the model's capacity to handle various types of inputs, contributing to its overall generalizability.

In conclusion, while the text does not provide direct evidence of specific techniques employed to guarantee the generalizability of the deep learning model, it suggests several factors that may positively impact the model's capability to generalize well. These include the model's architecture, usage of max pooling layers, and application of a diverse dataset.
