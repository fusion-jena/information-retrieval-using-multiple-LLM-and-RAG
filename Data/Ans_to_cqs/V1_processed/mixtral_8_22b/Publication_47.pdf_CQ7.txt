The data was split into a training set and a test set using a random split method. The training set consisted of 90% of the entries, while the remaining 10% were allocated to the test set. Furthermore, 20% of the training set was utilized for validation purposes. To account for the relatively small dataset size, cross-validation was carried out by shifting the validation set five times. This process aimed to determine the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. Subsequently, the neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss was selected from a range of models featuring different numbers of hidden layers and feature subsets. This chosen model was employed to predict the conservation status of all orchid species at two distinct levels: binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened) and detailed (CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC).
