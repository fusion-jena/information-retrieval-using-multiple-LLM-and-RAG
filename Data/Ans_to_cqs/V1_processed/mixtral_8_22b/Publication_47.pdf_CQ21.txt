After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and gain insights into its predictions. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Calculating metrics: Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., can be calculated to measure the performance of the model. These metrics help in understanding how well the model is performing and where it needs improvement.

2. Creating confusion matrices: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class. This helps in identifying any biases or imbalances in the dataset.

3. Generating saliency maps: Saliency maps highlight the regions in the input image that contribute most to the output prediction. They provide insight into which parts of the image were important for making the decision.

4. Visualizing feature importance: Feature importance plots display the relative importance of different features in determining the final outcome. This helps in understanding which features have the greatest impact on the model's predictions.

In this study, the authors used IUC-NN to predict the conservation status of all orchid species at two levels: binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened) and detailed (CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC). After training the model, they likely evaluated its performance using some combination of these postprocessing techniques. However, since the paper does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps, it is difficult to determine exactly what steps were taken.
