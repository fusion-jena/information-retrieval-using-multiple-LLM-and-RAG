The deep learning model described in the given context uses Python2.7 along with several libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow. Therefore, we can infer that TensorFlow is one of the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, there is no mention of other popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or Keras.
