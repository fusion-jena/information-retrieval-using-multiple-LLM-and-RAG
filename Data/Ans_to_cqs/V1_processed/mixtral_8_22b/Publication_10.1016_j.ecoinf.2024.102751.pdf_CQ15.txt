Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, the text does suggest the potential application of machine learning or deep neural networks for increasing the accuracy of predictions related to soil moisture estimation. These models often employ optimization techniques like SGD or Adam during their training process to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that if these methods were implemented, they might utilize optimization techniques like SGD or Adam.
