The text mentions the use of an early stop approach as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. This technique halts the training process prematurely if performance on a validation dataset fails to improve beyond a predefined threshold. By doing so, it prevents the model from becoming too complex and fitting the noise in the data instead of the underlying patterns. Additionally, the authors mention keeping the first CNN model layers frozen during training with transfer learning, which can be seen as another form of regularization. Freezing these layers helps maintain the learned features from the original dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting when fine-tuning the model on the new dataset. However, the text does not explicitly mention other regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.
