The given context does not explicitly mention which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, one reference mentioned is Lasser, J., Katifori, E., Dec. 2017. NET: a new framework for the vectorization and examination of network data. This suggests that the authors may have developed or used a custom framework called 'NET'. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot confirm if this framework is based on popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
