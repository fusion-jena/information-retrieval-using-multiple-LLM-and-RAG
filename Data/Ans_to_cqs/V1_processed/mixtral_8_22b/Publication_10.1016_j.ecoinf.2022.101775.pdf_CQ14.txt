The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, there is mention of a grid search being used to tune the MF model for comparison purposes. This suggests that the authors may have also employed similar methods like grid search or random search to optimize the hyperparameters of their proposed DMF models. Unfortunately, without more specific details from the given context, it cannot be definitively stated which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the DMF models.
