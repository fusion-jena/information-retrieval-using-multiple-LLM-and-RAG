Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for wildfire analysis. However, it does mention that Google Earth Engine (GEE) hosts a vast remote sensing data catalog, including European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) datasets over 40 years. These datasets can be readily processed using JavaScript, Python, or R application programming interfaces (APIs) and advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Therefore, while we cannot specify the exact dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, we can infer that various satellite imagery datasets from ESA and NASA are likely being utilized in the deep learning pipeline for wildfire analysis.
