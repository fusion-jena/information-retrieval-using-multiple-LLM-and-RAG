The performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models is evaluated using four different metrics: test loss, mean squared error (MSE), mean average percentage error (MAPE), and accuracy (Acc). For regression tasks, such as predicting River Age, Sea Age, and Spawning, accuracy is calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it with the ground truth. The labels provided by human readers are considered the ground truth, and accuracy and other performance metrics relate directly to these labels.

In summary, the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model include:

1. Test Loss: A measure of how well the model performs on unseen data during testing. Lower values indicate better performance.

2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): This measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. Lower values suggest better performance.

3. Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE): This provides the average absolute percent error between predictions and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.

4. Accuracy (Acc): For classification tasks, this represents the proportion of correct classifications out of total instances. For regression tasks, it is calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it with the ground truth.
