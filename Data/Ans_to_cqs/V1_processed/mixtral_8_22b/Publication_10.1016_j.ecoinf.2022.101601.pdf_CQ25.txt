Based on the given context, it appears that there isn't enough information to determine the specific purpose of any deep learning model mentioned. However, we do have details about the Bayesian Network (BN) model called PermaBN, developed using the GeNIe software.

PermaBN aims to achieve three main objectives:

1. Providing an alternative permafrost modeling framework that enhances understanding and prediction of permafrost dynamics under different climate or ecosystem conditions. This enables exploratory and scenario analyses.

2. Identifying knowledge and data gaps that impede our understanding and modeling capabilities of permafrost dynamics.

3. Facilitating participatory modeling among researchers and stakeholders.

While this does not directly address the purpose of a deep learning model, it provides insight into the goals of one particular model used in the study. Unfortunately, without further context regarding other potential deep learning models, I cannot accurately describe their purposes.
