Areas dominated by the target communities were digitized as polygons, and all pixels contained were extracted. These polygons were then split into calibration and validation sets, with approximately 30% of pixels for each VT reserved for independent model validation. Spatial autocorrelation effects on model accuracies were minimized by splitting polygons instead of pixels. The Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier was used to classify the VTs, utilizing optimized random trees where each new tree learned from the errors of those previous. Seasonal vegetation index composites from S2, backscatter composites from S1, elevation, and slope were used as inputs to the machine learning algorithm, totaling up to 54 features. Compositing periods were chosen based on >50% cover of specific plant species or habitat types.
