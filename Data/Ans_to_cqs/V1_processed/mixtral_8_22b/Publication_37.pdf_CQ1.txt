Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used consists of 5428 flight calls from 43 different bird species. Typically, such data could be collected through various means such as acoustic sensors or microphones placed in strategic locations where these birds are known to fly over. Additionally, public datasets containing recordings of bird sounds may have been used. Surveys or citizen science projects might also contribute to the collection of such data. Nevertheless, the specific methods employed for gathering the raw data in this case remain undisclosed within the provided information.
