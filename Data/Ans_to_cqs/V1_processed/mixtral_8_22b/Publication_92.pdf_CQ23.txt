The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that the network uses inception layers based on GoogleNet architecture, which has been shown to perform well across various computer vision tasks due to its ability to capture multi-scale features. Additionally, the authors mention adapting certain parameters like stride sizes and initial convolution settings to improve performance, suggesting they might have used techniques like hyperparameter tuning or transfer learning to enhance the model's adaptability to different data distributions. Nonetheless, without further information regarding the validation methods employed during the development process, it remains unclear whether these practices were implemented specifically to address concerns related to generalization.
