Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used to derive Lang10m from GEDI and Sentinel-2 images. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to any code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, it might be worth checking out the referenced paper by Lang et al. (2022), as they may have shared additional resources or links within their publication.
