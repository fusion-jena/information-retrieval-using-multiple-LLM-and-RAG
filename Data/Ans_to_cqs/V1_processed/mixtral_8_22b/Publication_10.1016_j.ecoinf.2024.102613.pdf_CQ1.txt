The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include using sensors, electronic resources like text, video, and image, and public resources. Sensors are commonly used to collect data in real-time, while electronic resources provide historical data. Public resources offer open access to large amounts of data that can be used for training models. Additionally, surveys can also be conducted to gather specific types of data required for the project. It is important to note that the type of data collected depends on the problem being solved and the availability of relevant data sources.
