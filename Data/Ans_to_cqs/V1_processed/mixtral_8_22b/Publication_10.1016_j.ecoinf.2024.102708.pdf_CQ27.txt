The article does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, some common practices for deploying deep learning models include model serialization, platform selection, and integration with other systems or applications.

Model serialization involves saving the trained model parameters and architecture in a file format that can be loaded later for prediction or inference. Common formats used for model serialization include.h5,.onnx, and.pb files.

Platform selection refers to choosing the appropriate hardware and software environment for running the deployed model. This could involve selecting cloud-based platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or using edge devices such as GPUs or CPUs for local processing.

Integration with other systems or applications involves connecting the deployed model with existing workflows or tools to enable seamless operation. For example, integrating the model with a web application or mobile app allows users to interact with the model through a user interface.

Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the exact steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model described in the article.
