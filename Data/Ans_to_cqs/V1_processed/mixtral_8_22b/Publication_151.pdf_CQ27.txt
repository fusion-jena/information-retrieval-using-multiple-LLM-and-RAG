The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the evaluation of DEPP on simulated datasets, the ability to train the CNN model within reasonable times, and the performance comparison with other methods like EPA-ng. The text also mentions the use of a single 2080Ti NVIDIA GPU and 8 CPU cores during training but does not specify any details regarding model serialization or platform selection for deployment. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
