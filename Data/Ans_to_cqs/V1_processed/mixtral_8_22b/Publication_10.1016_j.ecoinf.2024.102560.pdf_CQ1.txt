In the provided context, several methods are mentioned for collecting raw data related to environmental studies. These methods could potentially be applied in a deep learning pipeline depending on the specific requirements of the project.

One of the primary sources of data mentioned is the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), which provides precipitation datasets produced by analyzing gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipitation. The spatial resolution of the CMAP is 2.5 degrees, and its temporal resolution is monthly. Additionally, Landsat satellite datasets were used to investigate water surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time (from 1985 to 2020). The selection criteria for these datasets included identifiability, with frames having cloud cover less than 10%. Radiometric calibration was performed on the selected images to minimize radiometric effects.

Furthermore, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images were also employed using UAV-carried spectrometers to collect near-map images. This method allows for obtaining high-precision remote sensing images in small areas and accurately analyzing ground information.

While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that other potential sources of raw data for a deep learning pipeline might include various types of sensors, such as those measuring temperature, humidity, or atmospheric pressure. Surveys or questionnaires may also be useful for gathering relevant data, particularly when studying human activities contributing to environmental changes. Public datasets, like those available through NOAA's repository, can provide valuable historical data for training machine learning models.
