During training, the model optimizes cross-entropy loss via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. The hyperparameters of the model are not explicitly mentioned as being optimized through either grid search or random search. However, it is stated that a validation set is used to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning may have been employed, but the specific methodology is not detailed in the given context.
