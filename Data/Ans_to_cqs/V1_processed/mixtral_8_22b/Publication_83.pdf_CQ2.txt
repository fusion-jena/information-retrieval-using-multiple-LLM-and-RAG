In the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio files. These audio files are processed and transformed into spectrograms or other time-frequency representations before being fed into the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification tasks. Specifically, the authors mention using 40 mel-bin spectrograms as one of their inputs. However, there is no explicit mention of any other data formats such as images, videos, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline.
