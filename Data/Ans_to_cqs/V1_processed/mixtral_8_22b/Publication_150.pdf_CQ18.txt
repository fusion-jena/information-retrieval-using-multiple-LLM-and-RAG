The authors implemented several strategies to monitor the model performance during training. Firstly, they used models pre-trained on the ImageNet database and then retrained them for bumblebee species classification using their own image dataset. They divided their full dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) groups while maintaining the proportional representation of images within species in both groups. Secondly, they used an image augmentation strategy that included random rotation, crop, shear, and horizontal flip to help reduce overfitting and improve the generality of their models. Lastly, they used prediction weights to help account for the class imbalance in their dataset. These strategies helped ensure that the models performed well during training and generalized well to new data.
