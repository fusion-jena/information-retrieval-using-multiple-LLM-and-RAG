The method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study involves using a lab-based image acquisition protocol applied to specimens. Ten chironomid taxa collected from five sampling sites within the South Morava river basin, Serbia, served as inputs for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The specific details regarding the lab-based image acquisition protocol are illustrated in Figure 1 of the paper. However, it should be noted that the authors do not explicitly mention any additional sources of data such as surveys or sensors. Furthermore, they do not indicate whether publicly available datasets have been incorporated into their work. Therefore, based on the given context, we can only confirm that the primary source of raw data for this study comes from the lab-based image acquisition protocol applied to chironomid specimens.
