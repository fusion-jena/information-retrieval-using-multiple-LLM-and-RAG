The authors have not explicitly mentioned the specific methods used for collecting raw data in their study. However, they do reference other studies that provide insights into this topic. For instance, Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) collected data from an automated imaging trap containing 24 different pest species. Additionally, Rustia et al. (2021) gathered data using multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses under various lighting conditions. These examples suggest that both automated traps and remote sensing devices could be employed for gathering raw data in deep learning pipelines related to pest identification and monitoring. Public datasets may also be available for use, such as the Pest24 dataset referenced in the paper. Nonetheless, it is essential to consider factors like data quality, relevance, and ethical implications when selecting or creating datasets for deep learning applications.
