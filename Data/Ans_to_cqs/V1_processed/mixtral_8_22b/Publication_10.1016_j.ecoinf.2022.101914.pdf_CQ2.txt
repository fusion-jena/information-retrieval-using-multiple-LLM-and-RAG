The given context does not provide information on the type of data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of biomod2 package in R for building models, which suggests that the input data might be in a tabular or matrix format compatible with R. The context also discusses the division of the study area into blocks, implying that spatial data could be involved. But without explicit mention of the data format, it cannot be definitively stated whether the data used in the deep learning pipeline is in the form of images, audio, video, CSV, or any other format.
