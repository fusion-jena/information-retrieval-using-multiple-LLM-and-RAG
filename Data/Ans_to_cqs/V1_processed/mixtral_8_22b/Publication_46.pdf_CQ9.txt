The information regarding the availability of the deep learning pipeline data repository is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location or platform where the data repository can be found. However, common platforms used for sharing research data include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. To find the exact location of the data repository, please refer to the original article or contact the authors directly.

Based on the context provided, we understand that the study focuses on developing a CNN architecture for Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) and comparing its performance with the BIOCLIM model. The study area is located in the Himalayan region, focusing on tracking and mapping the Rhododendron arboreum species. The methodology involves creating a probability distribution model for the species using various ecological and bioclimatic satellite-based observations. The results indicate that the CNN-based model outperforms the BIOCLIM model, with improved accuracy metrics like AUC, Kappa, and TSS scores.

However, there is no mention of the data repository containing the deep learning pipeline used in this study. For more detailed information about the data repository, readers should consult the original publication or reach out to the corresponding author(s).
