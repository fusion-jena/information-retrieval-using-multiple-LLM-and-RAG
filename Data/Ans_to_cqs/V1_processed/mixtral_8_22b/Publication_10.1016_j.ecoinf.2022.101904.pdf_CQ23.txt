The paper does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, they do discuss evaluating the performance of their proposed model with varying amounts of training data to determine the minimum amount needed to achieve acceptable levels of accuracy. They also use multiple types of transformers and compare them against each other and existing methods. Additionally, they evaluate their method across several classes including Bog, Fen, Marsh, Swamp, Shallow water, Deep water, and Upland. These steps suggest that some effort has been made to improve the robustness and applicability of their approach.
