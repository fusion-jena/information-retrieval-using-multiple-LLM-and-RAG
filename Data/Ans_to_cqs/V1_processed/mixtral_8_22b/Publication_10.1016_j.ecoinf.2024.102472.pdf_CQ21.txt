After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements and goals of the analysis. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., is essential. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned from the training data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: To improve the model's performance further, hyperparameters like learning rate, momentum, number of iterations, etc., can be adjusted using techniques like Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization, etc.

3. Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. In this case, the trained network was used for feed-forward predictions on continuous spatial data.

4. Visualizations: Creating visual representations of the results can aid in understanding the model's performance better. For example, confusion matrices can provide insights into the types of errors made by the model, while saliency maps can highlight important features contributing to the prediction.

In summary, postprocessing steps after model training may include model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, making predictions, and creating visualizations. However, these steps will depend on the specific needs and objectives of the analysis.
