Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance and accuracy. These may include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a specific range or have a mean of zero and unit variance. Common methods for normalization include Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization, and decimal scaling.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, this step aims to bring all features into the same scale. Techniques such as standardization (Z-scores), min-max scaling, and robust scaling can be used for scaling.

3. Cleaning: This process removes noise from the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data points. Strategies like imputation, interpolation, and deletion can help clean the dataset.

4. Feature engineering: This step involves creating new features based on existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns in the data. It includes techniques like polynomial expansion, binarization, and encoding categorical variables.

5. Dimensionality reduction: In cases where high dimensional datasets cause computational challenges, reducing the number of features using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can prove beneficial.
