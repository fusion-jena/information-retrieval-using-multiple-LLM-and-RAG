The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that all images were resized to 1333 x 800 pixels to match with the pre-training data (COCO dataset) used to prepare the first layers of the model. This could be considered as one form of data augmentation technique, where the input images are transformed or manipulated to increase the amount of training data available. Other common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering. These techniques help improve the generalization ability of the model by introducing variations into the training data. Without explicit mention of these techniques in the given context, it is not possible to confirm which ones were applied in this particular case.
