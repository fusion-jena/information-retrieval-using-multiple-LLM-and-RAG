The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a large environmental context around each observation is collected and provided to the model. This includes WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude). These could potentially be obtained through various means such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, or publicly available datasets. But without more specific information, it cannot be definitively stated how these data were collected.
