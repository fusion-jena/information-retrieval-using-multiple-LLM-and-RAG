The text does not provide explicit information about any specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, we can infer that certain postprocessing steps might be involved. For instance, evaluating the model's performance through metrics calculation, creating confusion matrices, or generating saliency maps could be part of the postprocessing steps. Nevertheless, without further context or information, it cannot be confirmed if these specific methods were utilized in this particular study.
