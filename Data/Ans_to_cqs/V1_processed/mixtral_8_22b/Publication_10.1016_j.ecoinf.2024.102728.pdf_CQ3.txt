The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, some possible data annotation techniques could include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. These techniques are often used for tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic understanding. Without more specific details from the context, it is difficult to determine which technique was employed in this particular study.
