The deep learning models in these experiments were trained using a server equipped with an Intel® Core™ i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz (32GB DDR4-2666 memory) and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU (8GB GDDR6 memory). Specifically, the methods utilizing YOLOv5 were trained for 300 epochs, while the classification network in method 1 was trained for 200 epochs. During YOLOv5 training, the learning rate was set to 0.02, with weight decay and momentum values of 0.001 and 0.9, respectively. On the other hand, methods employing Faster RCNN were trained with 90 thousand iterations, each involving training the model on a batch of images. The fundamental parameters for Faster RCNN training mirrored those of YOLOv5.
