The text does not explicitly mention any specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does touch upon the concept of transfer learning, where pre-trained models like those based on the COCO dataset are used as a starting point for new tasks. This technique could potentially mitigate some effects of random initialization since the model already possesses learned features from a different but related task. Additionally, the text mentions using pre-trained COCO weights for image segmentation, indicating that these weights might help stabilize the learning process. Nonetheless, the document does not delve into explicit methods for controlling randomness within the deep learning pipeline.

Based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed explanation about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, the mentioned concepts of transfer learning and using pre-trained weights suggest possible ways to manage variability caused by random initializations.
