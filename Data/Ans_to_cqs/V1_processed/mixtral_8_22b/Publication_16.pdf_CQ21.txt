After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or task. Based on the given context, it appears that the following postprocessing steps have been carried out:

1. Model Evaluation: The model has been evaluated using various performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. These metrics help assess the overall performance of the model and its ability to correctly identify different bird species based on their calls.

2. Deployment and Inferencing: The trained model has been deployed in a test environment to evaluate its real-world performance. This involves passing new audio samples through the model and obtaining predictions. In this case, the model was able to accurately predict the Common Wood Pigeon with high confidence.

3. Logging Predictions: The predicted vectors generated by the model have been logged to a website for further analysis and review. This allows researchers to monitor the model's performance over time and make any necessary adjustments.

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, other common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps, calculating confusion matrices, and visualizing model weights. However, these methods may not always be relevant or applicable depending on the nature of the problem being addressed.
