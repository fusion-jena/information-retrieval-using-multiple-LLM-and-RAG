Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed answer about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models. However, I can share some general steps typically involved in deploying a trained deep learning model:

1. Model Serialization: After training, the model needs to be serialized or converted into a format that can be easily stored and transferred. Common formats include.h5 (HDF5),.pkl (pickle), ONNX, etc.

2. Platform Selection: Choose a platform where the model will be deployed. It could be a local machine, cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or edge devices.

3. Deployment: Depending upon the chosen platform, specific methods are employed to integrate the serialized model. For instance, if using Flask (Python web framework), one would create an API endpoint that accepts user inputs, processes them through the loaded model, and returns predictions.

4. Monitoring & Maintenance: Once deployed, it's essential to monitor the performance of the model over time and update it periodically to maintain its accuracy and efficiency.
