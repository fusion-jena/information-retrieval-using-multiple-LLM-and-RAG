The current study utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in its deep learning pipeline. For biological soil crusts, the information from multispectral or hyperspectral images is used to reduce the annotation effort. Some biocrust organisms have defined reflective properties in the ultraviolet and/or the infrared spectrum, making it useful to use multispectral or hyperspectral data as input for deep learning models for biocrust monitoring. However, these approaches are heavily dependent on cost-intensive airborne data acquisition of multispectral imagery.

When it comes to low-cost remote sensing biocrust monitoring, which is done manually by humans over long time periods, the data acquisition methods and/or devices can change over time. Different camera devices record data differently due to factors such as sensor construction, sensor size, resolution, aperture, field of view, and automated post-processing. In the case of biological soil crusts, automated semantic image segmentation approaches were not sufficient, so a manual image annotation was necessary. Once a dataset of a specific location and community has been created and the deep learning model has been trained on it, it becomes easier to process large amounts of image data.

Therefore, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include both high-cost airborne data acquisition of multispectral imagery and low-cost manual image collection using various camera devices.
