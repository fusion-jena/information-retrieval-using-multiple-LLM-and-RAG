The text does not explicitly mention which specific metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does state that a contrastive loss function was applied to evaluate the loss and accuracy based on the prediction and ground truth. Additionally, the term 'discrimination accuracy' is mentioned when discussing the results of the experiment, suggesting that accuracy might have been one of the metrics used to measure the model's performance. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot confirm whether other common metrics such as precision or recall were also utilized.
