The context does not explicitly state the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the research involves training a deep learning model on large datasets of fish images for biomass estimation. Therefore, we can infer that one of the primary data formats used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. Additionally, the context refers to utilizing underwater films for fish biomass estimation, suggesting that video data might also be part of the input data for the deep learning pipeline.
