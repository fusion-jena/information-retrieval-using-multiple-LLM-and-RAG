The papers mentioned do not explicitly state the use of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, they discuss various types of remote sensing data used in their studies. For instance, Tang et al. (2022) integrated Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data for mapping canopy height of China's forests. Ma et al. (2019) conducted a meta-analysis on deep learning applications in remote sensing without specifying particular datasets. Mandal et al. (2020) utilized dual polarimetric radar vegetation index for crop growth monitoring using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Menze et al.'s paper does not provide information about datasets used. Tamiminia et al. (2021) compared machine and deep learning methods to estimate shrub willow biomass from unmanned aircraft system (UAS) imagery. Tamiminia et al. (2021a) focused on decision tree-based models for forest above-ground biomass estimation using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Landsat data. Leite et al. (2022) characterized large-scale multi-layer fuel load in tropical savanna using GEDI spaceborne LiDAR data. Li et al. (2013) employed machine learning approaches for forest classification and change analysis using multi-temporal Landsat TM images. Lastly, Li et al. (2017) discussed Landsat 15-m panchromatic-assisted downscaling (LPAD) of the 30-m reflective wavelength bands to Sentinel-2 20-m resolution.
