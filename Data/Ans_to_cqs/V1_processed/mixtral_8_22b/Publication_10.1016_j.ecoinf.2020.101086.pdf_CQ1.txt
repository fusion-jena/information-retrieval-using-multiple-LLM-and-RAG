The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Instead, it focuses on correcting the effects of sampling bias in species distribution modeling when dealing with a low number of presence data. This research paper proposes a new method to address environmental biases in situations where there is data scarcity.

However, based on general knowledge about data collection methods for machine learning and deep learning applications, some common ways to collect raw data include:

1. Surveys: Data can be collected through various types of surveys, including online forms, phone interviews, or face-to-face interactions. These surveys often gather information related to user preferences, opinions, or behaviors.

2. Sensors: Various sensors can be employed to capture real-time data, such as temperature sensors, motion detectors, or GPS devices. These sensors are commonly used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications and can generate large volumes of time-series data.

3. Public Datasets: Many organizations and institutions release publicly accessible datasets that can be used for training machine learning algorithms. Examples include ImageNet for image classification tasks, UCI Machine Learning Repository for various datasets across different domains, and Kaggle competitions datasets.
