The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on this information. Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics can be calculated based on the confusion matrix, which summarizes the predictions made by the model compared to the actual values. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made, while precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives, and F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. AUC-ROC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes. Without further information about the specific deep learning model being used and its intended application, it is difficult to determine which metric would be most appropriate for evaluating its performance.
