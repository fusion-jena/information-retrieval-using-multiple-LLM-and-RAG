From the given context, it is not possible to determine what specific data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided about the water samples being analyzed, we can infer that the data format used might be numerical or tabular data such as CSV files. These could contain various water quality parameters like pH, water temperature, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, TP, Chl-a, DOC, etc. Additionally, there may also be some form of spectrometric data related to CDOM and FDOM spectral analyses. But without explicit mention of the use of images, audio, or video data, it cannot be confirmed if these formats are part of the deep learning pipeline.
