The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study utilizes data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys. This suggests that one method used for gathering data could be conducting surveys. Additionally, since the study focuses on assessing the impact of urban development on species distribution, it is possible that other sources of data such as satellite imagery or remote sensing might have been used to collect relevant environmental variables. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed which exact methods were employed for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
