Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine what type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. The given context mentions the use of random forest models, which belong to the category of machine learning algorithms rather than deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, it cannot be determined if a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer was employed in the pipeline.
