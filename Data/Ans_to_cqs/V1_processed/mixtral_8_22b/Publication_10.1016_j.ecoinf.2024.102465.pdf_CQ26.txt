While the given context does not explicitly mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it is possible to infer some potential methods from the information provided.

One common technique mentioned indirectly is stratified sampling or splitting, which involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, such as class labels, to ensure that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.

Another technique that could be implied from the use of the XGBoost algorithm is oversampling or undersampling. These techniques involve either duplicating samples from minority classes (oversampling) or removing samples from majority classes (undersampling) to balance the class distribution in the dataset. This can help mitigate the effects of imbalanced datasets and improve the performance of the model.

Additionally, the use of diverse data sources, such as social media data and satellite imagery, suggests that collecting data from multiple sources may also help reduce data bias by providing more comprehensive and representative samples.

Overall, while the given context does not provide explicit details about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it implies several potential approaches, including stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
