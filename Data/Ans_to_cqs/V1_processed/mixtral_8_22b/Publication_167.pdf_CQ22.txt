Based on the given context, the specific metric(s) used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, some clues suggest that accuracy might be one of the metrics used. For instance, the text mentions that the mean value of the ten results from the 10-fold cross-validation method is used to estimate the accuracy of the model. This implies that accuracy could be one of the evaluation metrics. Nevertheless, without explicit information about other potential metrics like precision or recall, we cannot definitively state what metrics were used to assess the model's performance.
