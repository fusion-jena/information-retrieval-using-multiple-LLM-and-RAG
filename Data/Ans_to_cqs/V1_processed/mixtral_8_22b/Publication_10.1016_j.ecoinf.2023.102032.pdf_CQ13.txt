The given context does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for improving cloud detection with machine learning. The article focuses on wetlands and their use intensity in East Africa using Earth observation data from Sentinel-2. It discusses the methodology for calculating wetland use intensity but does not mention any details about a specific deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model based on this context alone.
