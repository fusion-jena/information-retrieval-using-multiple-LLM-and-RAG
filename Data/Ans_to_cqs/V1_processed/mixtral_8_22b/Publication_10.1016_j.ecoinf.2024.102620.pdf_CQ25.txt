The purpose of the deep learning model used in this research is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for land use specification mining and urban development prediction. Specifically, the PLUS model, which includes a deep learning component, is employed to analyze land expansion strategies and predict future urban development patterns. The model utilizes a random forest algorithm to calculate development probabilities of different land use types based on historical land use data. Additionally, the model incorporates a multi-type random patch seed mechanism to simulate patch growth and land use changes over time. Therefore, while the specific task of the deep learning model (such as classification or regression) is not mentioned, it appears to play a role in analyzing and forecasting land use dynamics within the broader context of urban planning and development.
