The article does not provide information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model is trained and tested on representative samples from each class.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the number of instances in each class to balance the dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing instances or creating synthetic ones using methods such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique). Undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class by randomly removing instances or selecting only those that contribute most to the classification task.

Diverse data collection involves collecting more data from underrepresented groups or classes to improve the overall representation of the dataset. This can be done through active learning, where the model identifies which instances it needs more information about, or through crowdsourcing, where human annotators label new instances.

These techniques help reduce data bias and improve the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines.
