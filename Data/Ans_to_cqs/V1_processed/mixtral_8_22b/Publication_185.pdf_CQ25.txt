The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the given information, we can infer that the primary goal of the deep learning model is likely related to image recognition or classification tasks. This assumption is supported by several factors mentioned in the text. Firstly, the authors reference the AlexNet architecture, which is widely used for image classification tasks. Secondly, the keywords listed include terms such as "butterfly classification" and "background removal," further suggesting that the model may be designed for identifying specific objects within images. Lastly, the mention of biodiversity implies that the model might be employed for categorizing various species or organisms found in nature. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model remains unclear, it appears to focus on some form of image analysis or classification task.
