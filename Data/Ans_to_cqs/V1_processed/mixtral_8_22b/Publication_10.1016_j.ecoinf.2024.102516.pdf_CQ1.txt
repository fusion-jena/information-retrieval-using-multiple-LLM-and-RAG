The paper does not provide explicit details about the method used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they use a ResNet50 architecture pretrained on ImageNet weights, suggesting that they might have used images as input data. Additionally, the authors reference other papers such as "Smart agriculture applications using deep learning technologies" by Altalak et al. and "Plant species identification using color learning resources, shape, texture, through machine learning and artificial neural networks" by Bambil et al., indicating that these studies could potentially involve similar data collection methods like image acquisition or sensor data. Nevertheless, without specific information regarding the data collection process in this study, one cannot definitively state what methods were employed.
