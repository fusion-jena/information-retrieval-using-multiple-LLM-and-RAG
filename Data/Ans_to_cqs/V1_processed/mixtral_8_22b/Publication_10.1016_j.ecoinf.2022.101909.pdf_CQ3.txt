In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in image recognition tasks like those mentioned in the text, we can infer some possible methods.

Data annotation techniques refer to ways of labeling or tagging datasets so they can be used to train machine learning algorithms. For image recognition tasks, these often involve marking objects within images to help the algorithm understand what it's looking at.

Two commonly used techniques in image recognition tasks include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around each object of interest in an image, while instance segmentation goes further by outlining the exact shape of each object.

Since the paper discusses using the ResNet50 model, which was pre-trained on ImageNet data, it suggests that the dataset likely consists of labeled images. Given that the input to their model is RGB images of size 224x224x3, it implies that the data might have been annotated using bounding boxes or instance segmentation. However, without explicit information about the annotation process, this remains speculative.
