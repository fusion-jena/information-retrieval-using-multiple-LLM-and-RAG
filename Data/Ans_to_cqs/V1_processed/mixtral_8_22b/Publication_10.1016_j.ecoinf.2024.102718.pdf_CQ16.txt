The training completion criteria mentioned in the provided context include the use of various callbacks such as ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint, and EarlyStopping. These callbacks help in modifying the learning rate dynamically based on the validation accuracy and preserving the best performing model iteration throughout the training phase. Specifically, the ReduceLROnPlateau callback reduces the learning rate when a metric has stopped improving, while the EarlyStopping callback stops the training process if a monitored metric has stopped improving after a certain number of epochs. Additionally, the ModelCheckpoint callback saves the best model based on a specified metric, typically validation accuracy or loss. Therefore, these callbacks collectively ensure that the training process is halted once the desired level of performance is achieved, preventing overfitting and unnecessary computational resources usage.
