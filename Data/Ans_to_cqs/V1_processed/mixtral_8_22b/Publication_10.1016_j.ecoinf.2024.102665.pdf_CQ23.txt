Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of Maximum Weight Spanning Tree (MWST) for supervised learning of the fish factor (FF) with all measured variables as predictors. It mentions increasing the dimensions used in the assessment through additional variables, which can be useful according to Peterson and Evans (2019). Additionally, it describes how the MWST-learned network was used for the final clustering of each group of variables. However, none of these details provide insight into the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, without further context or information, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
