The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning, common preprocessing steps may include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the data into a standard format or range, such as between 0 and 1, to ensure consistent input scales. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric features to a similar scale, preventing features with higher magnitudes from dominating the analysis. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, outliers, or errors within the dataset. These preprocessing techniques help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning models by preparing the data for optimal use during training.
