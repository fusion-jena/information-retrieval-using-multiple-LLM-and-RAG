The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid-search strategy. This means that a range of possible values for each hyperparameter is defined, and then all combinations of these values are tested to find the best set of hyperparameters for the given problem. In this study, the optimal parameters for both the base and meta-models are determined using this method. The stacking ensemble model is developed using the scikit-learn library in Python 3.7, which provides tools for implementing machine learning algorithms and performing tasks such as hyperparameter optimization.
