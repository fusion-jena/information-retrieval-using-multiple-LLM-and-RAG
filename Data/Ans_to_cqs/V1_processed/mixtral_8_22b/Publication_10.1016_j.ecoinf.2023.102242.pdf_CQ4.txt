Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the challenges faced during the classification process due to the large amount of feature information present in high-resolution remote sensing data. It also mentions the importance of having representative and sufficient training samples for accurate classification models.

To address these issues, the study employs feature optimization tools, but it does not provide details about what those tools are or if they include data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
