Based on the given context, it appears that the data was divided into source and target datasets for training and testing purposes. Specifically, the convolutional neural network (CNN) model was trained with a source dataset to predict images from a different target dataset. Three source-target pairs were used: GH!LH, GH!LL, and LL!LH. It seems that these splits were chosen to simulate two scenarios: (i) a global image database is used to predict local samples (GH!LH and GH!LL) and (ii) conventional images are used to predict other images (LL!LH). However, the exact criteria used to select the specific subsets of images for each source and target dataset are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
