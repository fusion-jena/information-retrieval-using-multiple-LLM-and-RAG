The text does not explicitly state the specific purpose of the deep learning models mentioned, such as whether they were designed for tasks like classification, segmentation, or detection. However, considering the context, it can be inferred that these models are primarily intended for classification purposes. This assumption is supported by several points within the text. Firstly, the authors mention using detailed labeled datasets, which suggests that the goal involves identifying specific categories or classes within the data. Secondly, the comparison between BirdNET and SincNet models implies that both aim to achieve similar objectives, likely involving categorization or identification of bird sounds. Lastly, the discussion about transfer learning using embeddings further supports this idea, as this method often focuses on applying knowledge gained from one task (such as image recognition) to improve performance in another related task (like object detection), typically within the realm of classification problems. Therefore, while the exact purpose isn't directly stated, it appears that the primary objective of these deep learning models is most likely classification.
