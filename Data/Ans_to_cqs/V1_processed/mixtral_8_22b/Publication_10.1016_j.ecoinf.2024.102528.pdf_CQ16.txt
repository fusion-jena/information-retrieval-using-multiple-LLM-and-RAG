Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete or if validation loss plateaus were considered. However, it can be inferred that the authors use BirdNET-Analyzer for identifying bird species based on their acoustic signals. They apply threshold values of fixed 0.35, 0.25, and 0.15 for the first, second, and third species in the list, respectively, to filter out predictions with lower confidence scores. This suggests that the authors may consider reaching these threshold values as an indication of successful training completion. Additionally, the authors mention examining species-specific thresholds, computing recall and precision for various thresholds, and demonstrating species-specific results. These steps indicate that the authors evaluate the performance of their model using metrics such as recall and precision, which could also serve as indicators for determining when training is complete.
