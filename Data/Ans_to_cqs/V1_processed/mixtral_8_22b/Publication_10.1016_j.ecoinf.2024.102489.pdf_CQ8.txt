The given context does not provide any information about the availability or location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper by D. Han et al. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors utilized various remote sensing data sources, including Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A, to extract high-quality LAI training samples using homogeneous and pure pixel filter methods and pixel unmixing methods. They then employed the support vector machine (SVR) algorithm to estimate high spatial resolution LAI. Additionally, they built a Random Forest (RF) model with optimized parameters using a grid search method based on OOB error and five-fold cross-validation. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its corresponding code repository within the given context.
