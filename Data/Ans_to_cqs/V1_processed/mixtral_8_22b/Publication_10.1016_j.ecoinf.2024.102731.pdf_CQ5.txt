The query asks about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, but the given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning pipelines or the datasets used within them. Instead, it discusses various types of geographical data such as climate data, digital elevation models, road networks, lithostratigraphic maps, hunting areas, and landscape metrics. These datasets have been used to analyze landscape dynamics and derive a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI). Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query based on the provided context. However, some examples of commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.
