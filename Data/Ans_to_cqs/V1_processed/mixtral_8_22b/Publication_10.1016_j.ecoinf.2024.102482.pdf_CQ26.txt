The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target variables in both sets. This technique ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with imbalanced class distributions. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. These techniques can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources or demographics to ensure that the dataset represents different perspectives and reduces bias. This technique can be particularly useful in applications where fairness and inclusivity are important considerations.

In summary, several techniques can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. However, the choice of technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the application requirements.
