Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context only mentions the use of field-collected data and machine learning methods for developing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) models, along with the integration of forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation due to insufficient high-quality training samples. Additionally, several references related to forest biomass, carbon dynamics, and vegetation maps are mentioned, but none provide details regarding the deployment platform for the deep learning model.
