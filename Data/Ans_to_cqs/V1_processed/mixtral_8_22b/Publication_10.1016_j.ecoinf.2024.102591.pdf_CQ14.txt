The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model used in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) implementation were optimized. However, it mentions that the default RF hyperparameters in the GEE implementation were preserved, except for the number of trees, which was set to 500 to improve computational efficiency without losing precision in the Burned Area (BA) estimates. This adjustment was made after recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires. Therefore, it appears that the optimization process involved some form of recursive validation rather than traditional methods like grid search or random search.
