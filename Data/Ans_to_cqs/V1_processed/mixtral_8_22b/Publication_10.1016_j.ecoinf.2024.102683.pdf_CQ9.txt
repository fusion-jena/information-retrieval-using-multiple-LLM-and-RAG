The given context does not provide specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects of deep learning techniques, such as attention mechanisms, data augmentation, and the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for plant identification. However, there is no mention of any specific data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
