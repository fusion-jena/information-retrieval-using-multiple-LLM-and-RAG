The pipeline described in the given text utilizes several types of deep learning models. For generating synthetic connectivity data, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model is employed. Additionally, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are mentioned as part of the overall approach. Furthermore, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are utilized in developing the initial coral cover model. Therefore, the pipeline incorporates various deep learning architectures such as GANs, CNNs, and VAEs.
