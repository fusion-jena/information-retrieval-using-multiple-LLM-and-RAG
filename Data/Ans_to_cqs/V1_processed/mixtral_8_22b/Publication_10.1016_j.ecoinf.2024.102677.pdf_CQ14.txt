According to the given information, it appears that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized through parameter tuning. However, the specific method used for parameter tuning, such as grid search or random search, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It can only be inferred that after parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively.
