In the context of ecological studies, one method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of camera traps. Camera traps are remotely triggered cameras that capture images of wildlife in their natural habitats without causing disturbances. The growing use of camera traps has resulted in an enormous volume of raw data in the form of images that require further processing and analysis. Other fields may also utilize various methods for collecting raw data, including but not limited to surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can gather information directly from individuals or groups, while sensors can measure physical properties like temperature, humidity, or motion. Public datasets provide access to pre-existing collections of data that researchers can analyze and interpret. Ultimately, the choice of data collection method depends on the specific requirements and objectives of each study.
