The given context does not provide explicit information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a machine learning algorithm, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), was employed to build a pest hazard class classification model. Typically, when working with CNN models, various optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) could be utilized. Unfortunately, without further details from the original source, we cannot definitively state which optimization technique was used in this particular case.
