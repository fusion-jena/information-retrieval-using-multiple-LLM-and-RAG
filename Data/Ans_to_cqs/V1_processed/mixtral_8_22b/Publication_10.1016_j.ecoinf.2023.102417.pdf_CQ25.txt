The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is semantic image segmentation. Semantic image segmentation involves classifying each pixel of an image into a particular category or class. It aims to provide a high level of accuracy in identifying different objects within an image. Neural network architectures such as UNet and DeepLabV3 have been developed specifically for this task. These models are typically trained using supervised learning techniques, requiring a significant amount of labeled training data consisting of input images and their corresponding target images. Target images for semantic segmentation contain labels for every single pixel, assigning each pixel to a specific class. In some instances, irrelevant portions of the image may be ignored during the modeling process.
