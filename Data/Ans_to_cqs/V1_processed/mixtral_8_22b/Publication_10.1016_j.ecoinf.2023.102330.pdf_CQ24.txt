Based on the given context, there isn't any direct information regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or dealing with random seed values. However, I can provide some general strategies often employed by researchers and practitioners to manage randomness in such scenarios.

1. Fixed Random Seeds: To ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments, one common strategy is to set fixed random seeds for various components like data shuffling, weight initialization, etc. This ensures that the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers is generated each time the code runs, leading to consistent results.

2. Cross-Validation: Another approach to mitigate the impact of randomness is to use cross-validation techniques. By splitting the dataset into multiple folds and training/testing models on different subsets, we can obtain more robust performance metrics and reduce the variance caused by random initializations.

3. Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds can help capture diverse patterns in the data and potentially lead to better overall performance. Techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking are popular ensemble methods used in machine learning pipelines.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size, regularization strength, etc.) can significantly affect model performance. Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are commonly used approaches to find optimal hyperparameters, which may indirectly address issues related to randomness in the pipeline.
