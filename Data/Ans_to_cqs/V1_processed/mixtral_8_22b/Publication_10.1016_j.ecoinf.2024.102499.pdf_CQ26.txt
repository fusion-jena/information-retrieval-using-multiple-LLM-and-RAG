The paper by S. Villon et al. does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, several methods could have been employed to mitigate data biases. These include stratified splitting, which ensures that the distribution of classes is maintained across different subsets; oversampling, where minority class examples are duplicated or synthesized to balance the dataset; undersampling, where majority class examples are removed to achieve balance; and diverse data collection, which involves gathering more varied samples to improve representation within the dataset. Without further details from the authors, it cannot be confirmed if any of these techniques were applied in this particular study.
