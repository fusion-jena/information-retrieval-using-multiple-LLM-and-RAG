The purpose of the ensemble modeling approach in this study was not explicitly stated as being related to deep learning or any specific task such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it can be inferred that the goal of employing this approach was to create a robust and accurate model for predicting the distribution of the study species. This was achieved by combining multiple models, including regression-based and machine-learning algorithms like Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models were then weight-averaged to produce a final ensembled model for each species. The accuracy of these models was tested through cross-validation, with the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) serving as the metric for assessing their performance. Therefore, while not directly mentioned, the purpose of this ensemble modeling approach could be seen as a form of multi-class classification, where the classes are the potential distributions of the study species.
