The purpose of a deep learning model can vary depending on the specific task it is designed for. However, based on the given context, we can discuss two common purposes of deep learning models in the field of computer vision: image classification and object detection.

In image classification, the purpose of the deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is to analyze an input image and produce a label that accurately describes its visual content. This label could be anything relevant to the image, such as identifying whether an image contains a dog or a cat. Alongside the label, the model also provides a probability score indicating the confidence level of the prediction.

On the other hand, in object detection, the goal of the deep learning model is more complex. Not only does it have to correctly identify the objects within an image, but it must also locate them by drawing bounding boxes around each detected object. This allows the model to pinpoint the exact position of multiple objects within a single image. Some popular and highly accurate object detection frameworks include end-to-end models that integrate advanced detection techniques with powerful CNN classification models.
