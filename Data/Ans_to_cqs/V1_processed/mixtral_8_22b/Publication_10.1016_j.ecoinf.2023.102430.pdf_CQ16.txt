The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the maximum number of epochs for the AlexNet (AN) algorithm was set to 15 after preliminary tests. This suggests that one possible criterion could be reaching a certain number of epochs during training. Additionally, the authors mention adjusting the learning rates for some algorithms, which implies they may have been monitoring the progress of the training process and making adjustments accordingly. Without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
