In the given context, the hyperparameters mentioned for the deep learning model are the learning rate and the batch size. The optimized hyperparameter values for these two parameters were 0.007 and 48, respectively. However, there is no mention of the specific optimizer used in the model. It should also be noted that the number of epochs was another hyperparameter that was tuned, but its optimal value is not explicitly stated in the provided information.
