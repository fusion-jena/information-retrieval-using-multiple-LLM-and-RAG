The information provided does not directly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, based on general practices in machine learning and computer vision tasks, these metrics could be relevant depending on the specific task being performed by the deep learning model. For instance, if the model is designed for object detection or classification within images, then accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices might be appropriate evaluation metrics. In case the model is intended for semantic segmentation or depth estimation, additional metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (mAP), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) can also be considered.
