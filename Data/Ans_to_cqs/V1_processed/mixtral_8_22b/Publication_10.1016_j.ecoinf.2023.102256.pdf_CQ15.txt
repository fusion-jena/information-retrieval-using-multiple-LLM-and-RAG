The text mentions that the Adam optimizer was used in the deep learning pipeline with a learning rate of 0.0005. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice among practitioners due to its computational efficiency and ease of implementation. It combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent, namely Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad), resulting in an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients and noisy data effectively. Other common optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which updates model weights iteratively based on the error gradient calculated from a single training example, and RMSProp, which scales the learning rate dynamically based on the average of recent magnitudes of the gradients for each weight. However, it should be noted that the optimal optimization technique may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset being addressed.
