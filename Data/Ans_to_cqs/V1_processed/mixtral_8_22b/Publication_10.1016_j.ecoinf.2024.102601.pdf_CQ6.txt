The given context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions the use of two prominent models - RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV - for hyperparameter optimization of the RF (Random Forest) algorithm. These methods help refine the performance of the RF algorithm by searching over a defined hyperparameter space. RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search, while GridSearchCV conducts an exhaustive search in the vicinity of the best hyperparameters found by RandomizedSearchCV. Additionally, the text discusses the creation of a comprehensive training dataset through a systematic three-step process exclusively using the dNBR model. Lastly, it highlights the optimization of input matrices for machine learning classification, focusing on selecting the most relevant predictors from S2 imagery and integrating explainable AI techniques.
