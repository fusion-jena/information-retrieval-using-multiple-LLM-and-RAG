Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix etc. However, it can be inferred that the authors have used certain evaluation methods to compare the performance of different models like GRNN, SVR, and ELM. They have also mentioned about the implementation of IFTL over these models to improve their knowledge transfer. Additionally, they have discussed about the issue of overconfidence in these models and how IFTL helps in controlling hesitancy during TL. But, there is no direct reference to any particular postprocessing step being carried out after the model training.
