Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, I can infer from the context that the experiment was conducted using Python 3.10 programming environment with libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. These libraries support model serialization which allows saving the entire model into a file or files after training and then loading it back for prediction. Also, since the experiment was carried out on a server equipped with an Intel® Core™ i7-8700 CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, it suggests that the platform selected for deployment could potentially involve hardware acceleration using GPUs. But without explicit details regarding the deployment process, this remains speculative.
