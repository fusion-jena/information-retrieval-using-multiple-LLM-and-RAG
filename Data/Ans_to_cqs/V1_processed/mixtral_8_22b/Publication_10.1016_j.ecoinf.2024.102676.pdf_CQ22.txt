The text does not provide explicit information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that rank values were obtained for the BCR (Base Classifier Rank) and DER (Dissimilarity Error Rate) for each species and fraction of missing landmarks. These rankings were then summed and averaged to calculate a final rank-based performance evaluation metric ranging from 1 to 6. A lower number indicates better overall performance of the FIT model. Therefore, based on this information, it can be inferred that the BCR and DER are two important metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context.
