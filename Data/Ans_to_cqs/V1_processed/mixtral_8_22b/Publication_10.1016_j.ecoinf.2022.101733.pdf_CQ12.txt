The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions neural networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM) being used for predicting chronic kidney diseases and segmenting glaciers in satellite images. It also discusses resolution methods for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) in remote sensing fields, including static and dynamic algorithms. Additionally, there is mention of optimization approaches for feature selection and optimizing SVM parameters.

While these details suggest the use of machine learning techniques, they do not explicitly state which type of deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers were employed. Therefore, without further context, we cannot definitively determine the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
