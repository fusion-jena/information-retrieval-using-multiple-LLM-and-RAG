The paper does not provide explicit information on how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the deployment might have involved some form of model serialization and platform selection.

Model Serialization: This involves converting the trained model into a format that can be easily stored, transferred, and loaded onto different platforms. Given that the authors mention using a cloud computing system, it's likely they serialized their model before uploading it to the cloud.

Platform Selection: The choice of platform would depend on various factors like cost, scalability, ease of use, etc. Since the authors used a cloud computing system, they probably chose a platform that supports cloud deployment, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. These platforms offer services specifically designed for deploying machine learning models, including those built using deep learning frameworks.
