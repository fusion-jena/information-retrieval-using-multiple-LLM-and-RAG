The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set (such as a minimum threshold for accuracy or a maximum threshold for loss), or observing a plateau in the validation loss over several epochs. It is also important to note that early stopping can be employed to prevent overfitting, where training is stopped if the validation loss starts increasing while the training loss continues decreasing. Without more specific details from the context, it cannot be definitively stated which criteria were used in this case.
