The papers mentioned in the given context primarily use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the main deep learning model in their pipelines. For instance, Wang et al. (2020a) developed an encoder-decoder-based deep learning model to estimate seagrass coverage, achieving an mIoU of 90.66%. This suggests that they employed a CNN-based approach. Similarly, Perez et al. (2020) utilized both a Deep Capsule Network (DCN) and a Deep CNN to map seagrass distributions, demonstrating comparable performances between the two models. Furthermore, Antoni Burguera (Burguera, 2020) created a convolutional layer-based Neural Network (NN) model to map Posidonia oceanica seagrass, resulting in high precision, recall, and accuracy scores. Lastly, Noman et al. (2021b) proposed using Faster R-CNN with the NASNet model, achieving impressive mean Average Precision (mAP) values on specific datasets. Overall, it appears that CNNs are the predominant choice among researchers when dealing with tasks related to image analysis or pattern recognition in this domain.
