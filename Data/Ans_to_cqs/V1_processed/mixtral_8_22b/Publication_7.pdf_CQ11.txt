Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, it can be noted that the authors used the Benthoz15 dataset [23] for fine-tuning their deep learning model. This dataset might contain the required data repository link or additional resources related to the deep learning pipeline. It would be best to refer to the original research article or contact the corresponding author for more specific details regarding the data repository link.
