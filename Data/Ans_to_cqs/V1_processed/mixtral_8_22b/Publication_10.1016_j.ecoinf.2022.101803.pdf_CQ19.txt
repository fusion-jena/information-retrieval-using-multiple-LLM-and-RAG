The given text does not provide information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models. It discusses various aspects of machine learning techniques such as bagging, boosting, and XGBoost, but there is no mention of any particular deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models.
