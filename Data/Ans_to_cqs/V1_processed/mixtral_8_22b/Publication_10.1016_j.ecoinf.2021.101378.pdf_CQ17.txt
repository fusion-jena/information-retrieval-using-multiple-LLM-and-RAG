Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which can lead to poor generalization to new data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and reducing its reliance on any single feature or group of features. This method was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context but is widely used in deep learning pipelines.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all weights in the network. By adding this penalty, the optimization process encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. In the given context, Hirata et al. (2017) and Ikegami and Jenkins (2018) use Maxent, which incorporates L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation, although these were not specifically mentioned in the provided context. It is essential to choose appropriate regularization methods based on the specific problem and dataset to achieve optimal performance and prevent overfitting.
