The purpose of the deep learning model is to automatically classify images retrieved from camera traps and send species information instantly to the concerned authorities using edge analytics. This aligns with UN Sustainable Goal 15, which aims to promote and restore sustainability on land. By enabling faster and cheaper acquisition of data, this approach can help accelerate research into addressing biodiversity loss. Specifically, the deep learning models used include Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121, all of which were trained on the same dataset and initialized with ImageNet weights. These models were implemented using Keras and configured to have both feature extraction and classifier layers as trainable.
