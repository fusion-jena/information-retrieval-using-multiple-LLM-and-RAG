The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the process involves selecting human labellers to separately annotate the sounds within the audio recordings. The conflicts between these annotations are then resolved using a majority rule or personal judgment if there is no clear majority. This suggests that the annotation technique might involve some form of sound categorization or labeling, but the exact nature of the annotation (such as whether it uses bounding boxes or instance segmentation) cannot be determined from the given information.
