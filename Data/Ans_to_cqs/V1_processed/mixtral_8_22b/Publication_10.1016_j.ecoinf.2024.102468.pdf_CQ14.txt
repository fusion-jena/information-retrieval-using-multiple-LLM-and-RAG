The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, whether through methods like grid search or random search. However, it mentions that the emission distribution parameters, B, which include the mean, covariance matrix, and mixture weight, are obtained using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Specifically, the Baum-Welch (BM) algorithm is mentioned as a typical example of this process. Furthermore, the B parameters are initialized using a sequential combination of the k-means clustering algorithm and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of specific optimization techniques like grid search or random search being used for tuning other hyperparameters of the model.
