The experimental setup mentions that all predictive models were implemented in the Python programming language version 3.8.5. However, it does not explicitly state which specific deep learning framework or library was used to implement the GRU-DNN model. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot definitively determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework was employed to construct this particular model.
