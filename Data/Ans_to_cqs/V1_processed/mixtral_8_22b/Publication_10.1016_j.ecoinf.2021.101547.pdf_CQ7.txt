The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, I can explain common practices regarding this topic.

In machine learning and deep learning projects, datasets are typically divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This division helps evaluate the performance of the model during and after training. Here are the purposes of each subset:

1. Training Set: This dataset is used to train the model, i.e., adjust the weights and biases of the neural networks. During this phase, the model tries to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values.

2. Validation Set: This dataset is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model, like learning rate, batch size, number of layers, etc. It provides insights into how well the model has learned from the training data and if any further tuning is required.

3. Testing Set: After completing the training and validation phases, the final evaluation of the model is done using the testing dataset. This step ensures that the model can perform well on unseen data and avoids overfitting.

Regarding splitting criteria, there isn't a universally accepted rule. However, a commonly adopted practice is to use 70-80% of the data for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing. These percentages might vary depending on the specific problem and the availability of data. For example, when dealing with small datasets, one might opt for cross-validation techniques instead of creating separate validation and testing sets.
