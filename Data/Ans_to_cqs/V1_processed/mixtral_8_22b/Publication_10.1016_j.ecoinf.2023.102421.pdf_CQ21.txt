After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps mentioned in the given context. These include evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 score. Additionally, statistical tests like the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test are applied to compare the performances of different models.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps involving saliency maps or confusion matrices. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the importance of each feature in making predictions, while confusion matrices help evaluate the performance of classification models by comparing predicted labels against actual labels. Since this study focuses on estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) rather than performing classification tasks, it might not require generating confusion matrices.

In summary, the postprocessing steps discussed in the given context involve calculating evaluation metrics and applying statistical tests to assess the performance of regression models. There is no explicit mention of creating saliency maps or confusion matrices.
