Unfortunately, the given context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it does state that more details about the architectures, training methods, preprocessing steps, and the hyperparameters can be found in the SI Appendix, Preprocessing and Training section. Therefore, without access to the full paper or the mentioned appendix, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
