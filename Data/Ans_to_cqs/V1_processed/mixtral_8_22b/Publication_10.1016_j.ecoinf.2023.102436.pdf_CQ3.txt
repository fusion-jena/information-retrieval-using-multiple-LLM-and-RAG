The papers mentioned do not directly discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, they provide insights into various applications of deep learning models in landscape analysis and design. For example, Cheshmehzangi (2016) uses computational simulations for integrated urban design, while Guo et al. (2023) construct 3D landscape indexes based on oblique photogrammetry. Ho (2023) introduces LaDeco, a tool to analyze visual landscape elements. These studies suggest that different types of data might require unique annotation techniques depending on the problem domain and objectives. Therefore, it is essential to choose appropriate data annotation techniques based on the research goals and available resources.
