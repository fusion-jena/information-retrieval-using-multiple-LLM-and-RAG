The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, typically, the data is randomly divided into these subsets with a common practice being 70/20/10 or 80/10/10 splits for train, test, and validation respectively. This ensures that there is enough data for training while also having separate sets for evaluating the performance of the model during training (validation set) and after training (test set). It is important to note that the exact splitting ratio can vary depending on factors like the size of the dataset and the requirements of the project.
