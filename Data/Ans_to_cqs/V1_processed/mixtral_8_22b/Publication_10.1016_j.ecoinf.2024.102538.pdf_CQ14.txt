The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters were optimized, whether through grid search, random search, or another method. However, it is mentioned that the learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and then reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs. Additionally, the minimum learning rate was established at 1 × 10^-5. The hyperparameter λ in Eq. (4) was set to 0.8, Mk in Eq. (5) was defined as 2^k+1(k = 1, 2,...K), and β in Eq. (6) was set to 0.4. These values suggest that some form of optimization process took place, but without further details, we cannot definitively say which specific method was used.
