The text does not provide explicit information regarding the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the training subset is utilized for the supervised learning step concerning PCÎ¸, while the overall counting pipeline is evaluated on the test split. This suggests that the model's performance might be monitored through its accuracy on the training set during the training process. Additionally, the use of a separate test split implies that the final evaluation of the model's performance would occur after the completion of the training phase.
