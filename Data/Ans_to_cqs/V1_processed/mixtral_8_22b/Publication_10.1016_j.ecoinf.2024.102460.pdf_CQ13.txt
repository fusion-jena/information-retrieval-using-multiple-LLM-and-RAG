Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is used for solving the prediction problem of time series data. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture commonly used for sequence prediction tasks. Typical hyperparameters for training an LSTM model include the number of layers, hidden units per layer, learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizer, loss function, and regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay. Without further information from the authors regarding their implementation details, we cannot determine the exact values of these hyperparameters used in their study.
