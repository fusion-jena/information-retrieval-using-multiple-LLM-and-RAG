The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is to predict the drought propagation time and analyze its relationship with various influencing factors. Specifically, it employs a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to enhance the processing power and robustness of the model. The model aims to handle the complexity of drought propagation time and the relationship between influencing factors more effectively. Notably, introducing LSTM into the CNN improves the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set by approximately 20%, compared to using the original CNN alone.
