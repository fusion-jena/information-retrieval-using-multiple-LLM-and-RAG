The context does not provide specific information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, common strategies used in machine learning and deep learning include setting a fixed random seed value before training models to ensure reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to reduce overfitting caused by randomness, and employing ensembling methods to combine multiple models trained with different initializations. These approaches help mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance and stability.

Based on the given context, it appears that deep learning has been successfully applied to monitor invasive alien plants using online digital images. Various pre-trained models have been utilized, such as Faster R-CNN ResNet101, Faster R-CNN ResNet50, and Faster R-CNN Inception-v2, along with datasets like iNaturalist and MS COCO. The study emphasizes the potential benefits of using deep learning for this purpose, including faster processing times and improved efficiency compared to traditional methods.

However, certain challenges remain, such as the limited availability of high-quality images for accurate species identification and the spatial concentration bias of social media images. To address these issues, researchers suggest incorporating additional sources of online data, such as textual information, and utilizing transfer learning-based deep ensemble neural networks for better accuracy and generalizability.
