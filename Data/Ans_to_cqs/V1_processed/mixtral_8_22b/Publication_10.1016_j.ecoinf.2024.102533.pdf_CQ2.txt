The information provided does not explicitly mention the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references cited, it can be inferred that the data format might include images or CSV files. For example, Arora et al. (2022) discuss a low-cost imaging framework for freshness evaluation from multifocal fish tissues, suggesting that images could be one of the data formats used. Additionally, since the paper mentions that data will be made available upon request, it implies that the data could potentially be in a structured format such as CSV. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains speculative.
