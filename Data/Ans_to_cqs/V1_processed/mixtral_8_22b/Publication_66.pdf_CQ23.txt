To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models, Browning et al. conducted several measures. They trained these models using different combinations of variables such as variation in longitude and latitude, altitude, and coverage ratio. This allowed them to explore the qualities of different models and select the optimum ones for all species. These optimum models produced behavioral predictions with high accuracy, correctly predicting non-diving and diving behaviors over 94% and 80% of the time, respectively. Furthermore, they demonstrated the superior predictive ability of these supervised deep learning models compared to other commonly used methods like hidden Markov models. However, the text does not explicitly mention specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models.
