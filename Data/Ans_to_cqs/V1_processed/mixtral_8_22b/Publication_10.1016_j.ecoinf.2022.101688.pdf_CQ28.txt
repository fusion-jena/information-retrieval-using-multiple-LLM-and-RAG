Microsoft Azure was used to deploy the deep learning model. Specifically, the Data Science Virtual Machine and a NCv2-series virtual machine (NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU) were utilized for model training and testing unless stated otherwise. Additionally, the model was also trained on a virtual machine running the "E2asV4" instance on Microsoft Azure with 16GB RAM and a 2.35Ghz AMD EPYCâ„¢ 7452 2 vCPU.
