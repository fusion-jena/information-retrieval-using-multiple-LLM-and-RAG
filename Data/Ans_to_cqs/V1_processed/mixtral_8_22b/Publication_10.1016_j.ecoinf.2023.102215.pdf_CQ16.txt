The text does not explicitly state the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that after 65K iterations, the training loss converges, indicating that convergence of the training loss might have been used as a stopping criterion. This means that once the training loss stops decreasing significantly or reaches a stable level, the training process could be considered complete. Other common criteria include reaching a maximum number of epochs/iterations, early stopping based on validation loss or accuracy, or manual inspection of the model's performance.
