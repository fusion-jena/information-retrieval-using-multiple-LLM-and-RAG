The text does not provide explicit details about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, but it does mention some hyperparameters used in the artificial neural network (ANN), which is a type of deep learning model.

For the ANN model, the hyperparameters mentioned are'size' and 'decay'. The'size' refers to the number of units in the hidden layer, while 'decay' is a regularization parameter used to prevent overfitting. The values for'size' were tested within the range of 1-20, and for 'decay', the range was set between 0.025-1.

Additionally, the transfer/activation function for the model was chosen as the logistic function. However, no specifics about the learning rate or optimizer are given in the provided context.
