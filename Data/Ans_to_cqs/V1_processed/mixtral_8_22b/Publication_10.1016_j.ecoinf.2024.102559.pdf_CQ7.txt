The context does not provide explicit information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation datasets for the deep learning model. However, based on the given table titled "Training Set" and "Test Set," we can infer that the data was divided into two main categories: Training Set and Test Set. Each set contains two subcategories: veg. and icep., which likely represent different types of vegetation. The total number of instances in each category is also provided. Unfortunately, there is no mention of a separate validation set, but it could be possible that one exists outside of the provided context.
