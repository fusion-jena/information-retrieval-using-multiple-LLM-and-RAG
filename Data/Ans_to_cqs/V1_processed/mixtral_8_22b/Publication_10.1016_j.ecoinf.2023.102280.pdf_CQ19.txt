The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build the deep learning models for noise reduction. However, it discusses various architectures and approaches used in these models, including U-Net architectures, transformer attention mechanisms, and networks operating directly on raw waveform data. It would be necessary to refer to the original research papers cited in the text to determine which specific frameworks were utilized in each case.
