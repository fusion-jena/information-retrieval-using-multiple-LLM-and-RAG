Regularization methods are employed in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training dataset too well and performs poorly on unseen data. Two common regularization methods are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the network more robust and prevents overfitting. It can be thought of as a way to combine many different neural networks with different architectures efficiently. During each iteration of the training process, a certain percentage of neurons are temporarily removed or 'dropped out.' This forces the network to learn redundancy and makes it less sensitive to the specific weights of any individual neuron.

On the other hand, L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all the weights in the network. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that generalize better. By adding this penalty, we discourage large weights that might cause overfitting.

These regularization methods help improve the performance of deep learning models by making them more robust and preventing overfitting. They are essential components of the deep learning pipeline and should be considered when designing and training models.
