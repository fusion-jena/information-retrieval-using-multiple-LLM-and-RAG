To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using fixed seeds for reproducibility. By setting a specific seed value, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated, ensuring consistent results across experiments. Another strategy involves averaging over multiple runs with different initializations or shuffling orders. This technique helps reduce variance and improve overall performance. Additionally, techniques like dropout regularization and batch normalization can introduce controlled noise during training, mitigating the impact of random initialization. However, these strategies do not directly address the issue of randomness in the provided context. Therefore, further information about the specific deep learning pipeline used in the case would be needed to provide a more accurate response.
