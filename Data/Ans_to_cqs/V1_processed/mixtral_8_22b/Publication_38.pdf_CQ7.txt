The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a random stratified sampling method to divide the dataset into these subsets. This ensures that the distribution of labels remains consistent across all subsets. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set.

The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is employed during the development phase to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the test set serves as an unbiased measure of the final model's performance before deployment. Common ratios for splitting the dataset include 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, but this can vary depending on the size of the dataset and other factors.
