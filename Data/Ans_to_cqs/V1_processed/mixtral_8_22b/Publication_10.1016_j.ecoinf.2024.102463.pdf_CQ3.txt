I apologize, but there isn't any information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the provided context. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, landmark annotation, and key point annotation. These techniques help label various types of datasets, such as images, videos, text, and audio, enabling machine learning algorithms to understand and interpret them effectively.
