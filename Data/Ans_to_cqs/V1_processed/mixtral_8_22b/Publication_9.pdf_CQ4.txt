The text does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. However, it discusses the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly those pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, for various ecological and biological research purposes. These include tasks like automated species identification and segmentation. It also mentions the process of fine-tuning these models through iterative optimization of model weights to reduce prediction errors, typically done via stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation. While data augmentation techniques are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting, they are not discussed in detail within this particular excerpt.
