Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color jittering are commonly used to artificially expand datasets and prevent overfitting during the training process. These techniques can enhance the robustness and generalization ability of deep learning models. However, without explicit details from the context, it cannot be confirmed which specific data augmentation techniques were utilized in this particular study.
