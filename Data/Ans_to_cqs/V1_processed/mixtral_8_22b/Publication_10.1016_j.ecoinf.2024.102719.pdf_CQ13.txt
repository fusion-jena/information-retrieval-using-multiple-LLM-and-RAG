Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm was employed to identify the most effective hyperparameters for the ensemble models. This suggests that various hyperparameters such as learning rates, optimizers, batch sizes, or even architectural parameters like the number of layers or neurons could have been considered during optimization. Nevertheless, without explicit information regarding these hyperparameters, we cannot definitively state which ones were specifically utilized in the deep learning model.
