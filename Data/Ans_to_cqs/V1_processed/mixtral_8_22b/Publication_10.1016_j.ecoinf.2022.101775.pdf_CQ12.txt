The given context does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are some clues that suggest the use of certain types of models. For instance, the paper by Sharma et al. (2020) mentions the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model for sentiment analysis of short sentences. Additionally, the paper by He et al. (2017) discusses the use of embedding layers in collaborative filtering, which could imply the use of a feedforward neural network or a recurrent neural network (RNN). The paper also mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent for optimizing the regularized cost function, which is commonly used in training deep learning models. Therefore, based on these clues, we can infer that the pipeline may involve the use of either a CNN, RNN, or a feedforward neural network. However, without more explicit information about the architecture of the model being used, it is difficult to determine the exact type of deep learning model employed in the pipeline.
