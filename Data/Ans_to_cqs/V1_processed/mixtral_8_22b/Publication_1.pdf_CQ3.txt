The text does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they use supervised learning methods, which typically involve labeled datasets. In this case, the labels could refer to different species or other relevant categories related to biodiversity monitoring. While the exact annotation technique isn't specified, common techniques used in similar applications include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding boxes enclose objects within images, while semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel with its corresponding object category. Instance segmentation combines both techniques, allowing multiple instances of the same object to be identified separately. Given the nature of the application, any of these techniques might be employed depending on the specific requirements of the project.
