The given context does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on land use and land cover classification using spectral indices and Random Forest algorithm. It discusses the calculation of various spectral indices like NDVI, EVI, SAVI, etc., and their formulas. Additionally, it outlines the sampling strategies for defining training and testing samples. However, there is no mention of any specific deep learning models or their associated hyperparameters.
