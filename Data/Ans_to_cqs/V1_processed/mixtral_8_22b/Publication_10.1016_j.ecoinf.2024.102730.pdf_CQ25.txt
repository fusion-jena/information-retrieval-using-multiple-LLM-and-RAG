The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to create models that predict different vegetation phenology characteristics. Specifically, three separate Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were trained: one to predict the start of the season, another to predict the peak of the season, and a third to predict the height of the peak season. MLP is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information. It consists of multiple layers of nodes (neurons) and uses an algorithm called backpropagation during training to adjust the weights and learn complex patterns in the data.
