All experiments were conducted on a Linux machine equipped with Ubuntu 20.04, utilizing an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5â€“2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz processor. Each basic model was compact and trained on a single TITAN Xp 12G GPU for evaluation.

Therefore, the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is a single TITAN Xp 12G GPU.
