The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves several steps. Initially, the authors use transfer learning, starting with a pretrained general-purpose YOLO object detector trained on the COCO dataset. They then freeze all layers except the last one, which they fine-tune for the specific task of counting wildebeests in aerial images. To address the issue of class imbalance between objects (wildebeests) and background (no-object), they increase the weighting given to the no-object component of the multipart loss function from 0.5 to 2. This helps the model better account for the large amounts of empty space in the training images. Additionally, the authors split each aerial image into 12 equal-sized tiles to facilitate easier processing by citizen scientists participating in the project on the Zooniverse platform. However, the text does not provide explicit details about other strategies such as validation sets, early stopping, or learning rate adjustments typically employed to monitor model performance during training.
