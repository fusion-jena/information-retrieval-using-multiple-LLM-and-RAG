The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for semantic analysis, specifically for investigating Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) from social media data. The model referred to here is likely a pre-trained word2vec model, which is a type of word embedding technique used for natural language processing tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The specific task this model performs is not directly mentioned, but it is implied that it is used for understanding the meaning and relationships between words in the context of CES research.
