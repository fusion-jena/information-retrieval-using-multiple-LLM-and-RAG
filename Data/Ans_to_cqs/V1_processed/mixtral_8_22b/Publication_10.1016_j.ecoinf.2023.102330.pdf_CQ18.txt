Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't enough context to determine what specific strategy was used to monitor the model performance during training. The table provides some parameters related to distance bin classes, encounter rates, and scale parameters of the detection function, but it does not mention any details about monitoring strategies or techniques used during the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query with the available information.
