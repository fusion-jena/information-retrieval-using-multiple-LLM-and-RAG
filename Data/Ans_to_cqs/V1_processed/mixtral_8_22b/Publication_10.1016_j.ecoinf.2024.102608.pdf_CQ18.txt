The text does not provide explicit information on the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the researchers employed a randomized grid search method to optimize the hyperparameters of various machine learning models. They aimed to minimize Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and maximize R^2 score. The table presented in the text likely contains the best performing hyperparameters found after conducting this optimization process. Unfortunately, without additional details about the specific metrics monitored during training or any validation techniques applied, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the monitoring strategy.
