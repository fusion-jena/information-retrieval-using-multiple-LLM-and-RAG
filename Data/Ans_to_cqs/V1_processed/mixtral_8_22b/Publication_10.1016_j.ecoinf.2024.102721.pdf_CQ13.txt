The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that Bayesian Optimization was employed to tune these hyperparameters. Commonly used hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizers (like Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent), activation functions, loss functions, and regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay. These hyperparameters play a crucial role in achieving high simulation accuracy and improving the generalization ability and robustness of the model.
