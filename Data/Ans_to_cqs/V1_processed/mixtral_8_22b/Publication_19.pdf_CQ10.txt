Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or reference to a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository containing the source code for their deep learning pipeline. It would be necessary to contact the authors directly or search for additional resources related to this work to find the relevant code repository.
