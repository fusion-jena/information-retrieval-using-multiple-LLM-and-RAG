Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, after training and evaluating the model, it might have been serialized into a format such as ONNX, TensorFlow Lite, or PyTorch script, depending on the chosen platform for deployment. This serialized model could then be integrated with various platforms like mobile devices, web applications, or edge computing systems, according to the project requirements.
