The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some general preprocessing strategies such as whitening and subtracting mean values along each frequency bin. These techniques might help reduce bias or improve model performance but do not directly address issues related to class imbalance or diversity in the dataset. To tackle these problems, common approaches include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Unfortunately, there is no mention of using any of these techniques in the given context.
