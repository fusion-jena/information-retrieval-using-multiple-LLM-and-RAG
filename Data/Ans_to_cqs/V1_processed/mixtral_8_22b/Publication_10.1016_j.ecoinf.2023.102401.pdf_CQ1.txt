In Step 1 of the deep learning pipeline, the method used for collecting raw data involves selecting appropriate water downloading gear and sensors for data collection. The acquired data is then pre-processed, including tasks like denoising, image enhancement, and correction. To create a dataset for training and evaluating underwater target detection models, the underwater images need to be labeled and separated into training and test images. However, specific types of sensors or equipment used for data collection are not mentioned in the given context.
