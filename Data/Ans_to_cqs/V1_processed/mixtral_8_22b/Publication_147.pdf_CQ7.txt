The context does not provide explicit details about how the data was split for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning to divide the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The exact proportions can vary depending on the specific application and available resources, but a common approach is to allocate around 60-80% of the data for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing.
