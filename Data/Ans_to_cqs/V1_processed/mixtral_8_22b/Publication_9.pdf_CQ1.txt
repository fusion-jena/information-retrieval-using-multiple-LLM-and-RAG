The text does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that digitized specimens are an indispensable resource for rapidly acquiring big datasets, suggesting that digital imagery or scanning might be used for data collection. Additionally, the reference to the study by Christin et al. (2019) implies that deep learning could have applications in various fields such as ecology, potentially involving diverse sources of raw data like sensor networks, satellite imagery, or camera traps. Nevertheless, without more explicit information, we cannot definitively state what methods are specifically employed for gathering raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
