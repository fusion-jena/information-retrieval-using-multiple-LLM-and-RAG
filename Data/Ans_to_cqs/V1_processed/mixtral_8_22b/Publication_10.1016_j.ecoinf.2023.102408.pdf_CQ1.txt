The study does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of remotely sensed optical and SAR datasets, which suggests that satellite or airborne remote sensing technology might have been employed to gather these datasets. Additionally, the study refers to field data, implying that ground-level surveys or measurements could also be part of the data collection process. Public datasets may have been used as well, but this is not explicitly stated in the given context.
