After the completion of model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific application and type of model used. In this case, the authors have mentioned using the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. This method involves training the model on all samples except one, then testing it on the excluded sample. This process is repeated until each sample has been left out once. To measure the model's performance, various metrics were calculated, including R^2, MAE, RMSE, and RRMSE. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions. Other common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps, which highlight important features in the input data that contribute to the model's output, and creating confusion matrices, which summarize the classification performance of the model. However, these methods were not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
