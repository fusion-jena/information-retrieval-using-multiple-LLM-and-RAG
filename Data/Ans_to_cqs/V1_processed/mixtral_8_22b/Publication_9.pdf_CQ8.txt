The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it is common practice for researchers to share their code repositories on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I would recommend checking these platforms for a repository associated with the authors Shawn T. Schwartz and Michael E. Alfaro, or searching for the name of the toolkit mentioned in the article, "Sashimi".

Based on my knowledge cutoff, I do not have information about the exact location of the code repository. It is also possible that the authors did not publicly release their code. For more specific details, please refer to the original research paper or contact the corresponding author directly.
