The authors do not explicitly state the specific criteria they use to determine when training is complete. However, they mention using a combination of techniques such as repeated cross-validation with the test datasets to optimize model parameters and check initial model performance. They also use a separate validation dataset to assess the final model accuracy. These methods suggest that the authors may have used some form of early stopping or convergence criterion to prevent overfitting during training. For example, they might stop training when the validation error stops decreasing significantly or starts increasing, indicating that the model has begun to overfit the training data. Without more detailed information about their training process, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
