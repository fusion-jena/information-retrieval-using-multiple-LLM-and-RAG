To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented during its development and training stages. Firstly, the model was trained using a diverse dataset consisting of various key species found within the African savanna ecosystem. This diversity helped prevent the model from being biased towards specific species or features, thereby improving its ability to accurately identify different animals across multiple regions.

Secondly, the model selection process involved choosing the version that performed best on the validation set, rather than solely focusing on minimizing errors during training. By prioritizing validation accuracy, this approach aimed to minimize the risk of overfitting â€“ a common issue where models become too specialized to their training data and fail to perform well when applied to new datasets.

Lastly, the patch size was strategically set to 1024 x 1024 pixels during inference to expedite processing without compromising accuracy. This decision allowed for efficient analysis of large areas while maintaining sufficient detail for accurate identification of target species.

In summary, the combination of utilizing a diverse dataset, selecting models based on validation performance, and optimizing patch sizes contributed significantly to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model developed for wildlife population estimation in African savannas.
