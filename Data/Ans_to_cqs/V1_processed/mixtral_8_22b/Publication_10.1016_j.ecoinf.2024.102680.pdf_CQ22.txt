Two main metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Precision and Recall. Precision is calculated as the proportion of true objects predicted by the model out of the total number of detected objects. In other words, it measures how many of the detected objects are actually correct detections. On the other hand, Recall is calculated as the proportion of true objects predicted by the model out of all the true detected objects. In other words, it measures how many of the actual objects are being detected by the model. Additionally, Average Precision (AP) is also used to measure the overall performance of the model across different classes. It is defined as the area under the Precision-Recall curve. Furthermore, when evaluating the efficiency of the model, Frames Per Second (FPS) is often considered, which measures the speed of processing video frames.
