The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set (such as a minimum threshold for precision, recall, F1 score, etc.), observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. It should be noted that these criteria may vary depending on the specific model architecture, task requirements, and available resources.
