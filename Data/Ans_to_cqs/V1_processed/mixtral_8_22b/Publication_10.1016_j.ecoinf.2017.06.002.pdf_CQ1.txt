The given context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on the available information, we can infer that various types of measurements are collected using different sensors installed at specific locations. These sensors could include equipment like towers, soil pits, etc., which might be part of a larger system for gathering environmental data. Additionally, there seems to be a focus on maintaining transparency and consistency in data collection and processing methods to facilitate comparability and compatibility across multiple databases. This suggests that the data collection process likely involves rigorous quality control measures and standardized procedures. Nevertheless, without further context, it cannot be definitively stated what specific methods are employed for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.
