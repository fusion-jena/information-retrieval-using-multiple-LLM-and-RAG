Based on the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in this study involves the use of remote sensing images from various sources such as NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat. These remote sensing image sources provide different pixel resolutions, which necessitated varying buffer radii during data collection. For instance, NAIP imagery used a 1-m buffer, RapidEye used a 5-m buffer, and Landsat used a 30-m buffer. The buffer polygons were then used to extract pixels' spectral data from the imagery. It appears that these remote sensing images serve as the primary source of raw data for this study. However, the context does not explicitly mention other methods like surveys or sensors for data collection. Additionally, there is no indication of the use of public datasets. Therefore, based on the provided information, we can only infer that remote sensing images are the main method utilized for collecting raw data in this study.
