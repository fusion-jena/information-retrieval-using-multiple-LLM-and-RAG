The text does not provide explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the workflow is integrated with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform of the D4Science e-Infrastructure, which allows accessing knowledge sources on-the-fly during processing. Furthermore, it states that geospatial data are offered as standardized NetCDF files available on a distributed ISO/OGC compliant Spatial Data Infrastructure. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data repository might be accessible through the DataMiner Cloud computing platform or the D4Science catalogue, although the specific platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF are not explicitly mentioned.
