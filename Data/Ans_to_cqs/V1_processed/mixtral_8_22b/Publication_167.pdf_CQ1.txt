Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the input data mentioned in the context might have been collected through various means like remote sensing, satellite imagery, or other geospatial data sources. These could also potentially involve publicly available datasets related to land use types, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distances to settlements, roads, and rivers. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of methods used for collecting raw data in this particular case.
