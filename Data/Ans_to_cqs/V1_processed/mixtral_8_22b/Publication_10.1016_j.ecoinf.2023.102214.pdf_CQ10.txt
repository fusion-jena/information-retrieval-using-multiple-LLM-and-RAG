The text does not provide information about the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the deep learning technology for photo reidentification is available through Whiskerbook.org, a platform for big cat ecologists. It also states that Microsoft sponsored Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org. Therefore, while I can't provide a direct link to the code repository, it seems likely that further information regarding the deep learning pipeline could be found on Whiskerbook.org or related resources.
