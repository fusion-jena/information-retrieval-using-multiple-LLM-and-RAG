The data was split into a training set and a test set for the purpose of training and evaluating the deep learning models. The split was done such that 80% of the data was allocated to the training set and the remaining 20% was assigned to the test set. This division allows the models to be trained on a substantial amount of data while also ensuring that they are able to generalize effectively to new, unseen data. By testing the models on a separate portion of the data, their performance can be evaluated objectively and any potential overfitting can be identified and addressed.
