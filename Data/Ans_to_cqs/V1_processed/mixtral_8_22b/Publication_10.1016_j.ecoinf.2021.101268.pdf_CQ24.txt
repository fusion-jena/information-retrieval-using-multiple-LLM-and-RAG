The given context does not provide explicit information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seed values. However, some common practices used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, averaging multiple runs with different initializations, or applying techniques like ensemble learning to combine predictions from various models trained with different random seeds.
