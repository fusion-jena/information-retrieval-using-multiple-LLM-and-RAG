Based on the provided context, it appears that the focus is primarily on exploring various sampling strategies for active learning experiments conducted within the embedding space of a specific transfer learning model called BirdNet-1. These strategies include uncertainty and diversity-based sampling, myopic (greedy) and adaptive (batch mode), and combinations thereof. However, none of these strategies directly addresses handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of different random seed values.

Random sampling is mentioned as one of the pure families of sampling strategies, where 5% of the samples are selected randomly. This could be seen as a way to incorporate some level of randomness into the process. Additionally, the context mentions that class labels are initially hidden from the classifier and incrementally revealed for each batch of samples queried by the sampling methods. This might also contribute to introducing some degree of randomness or variability into the system.

However, the context does not explicitly discuss any specific strategies aimed at controlling or mitigating the effects of randomness introduced through factors like random seed values. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I cannot offer a detailed explanation of how randomness in the deep learning pipeline is handled in this particular case.
