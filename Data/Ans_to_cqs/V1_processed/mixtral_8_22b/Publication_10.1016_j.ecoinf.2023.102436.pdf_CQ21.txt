The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, we can infer that the process involves generating a restorative map using the trained model, which helps identify areas with high restorative potential and those needing enhancement. This map is then used to modify the landscape design, focusing on improving underperforming areas. After modifying the design, it is fed back into the system for further model development, point cloud generation, and performance assessment. This iterative process continues until achieving a high-performance design or meeting desired objectives. Although not explicitly mentioned, common postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculations, and confusion matrices could be employed during this process to evaluate and fine-tune the model's performance.
