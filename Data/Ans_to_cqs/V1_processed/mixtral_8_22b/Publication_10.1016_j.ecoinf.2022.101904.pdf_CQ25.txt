The purpose of the deep learning model proposed in the paper is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information available, it appears that the model is designed for image classification tasks related to wetland mapping. Specifically, the model is called 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer), and it aims to improve wetland mapping by addressing the challenge of limited ground-truth data. The table presented in the context shows various performance metrics for different classes of wetlands, suggesting that the model is used for multi-class classification. Additionally, the use of transformers in the model suggests that it leverages attention mechanisms to capture global contextual information, which may help improve its ability to classify images accurately.
