The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is images since the text discusses image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the authors employ the activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet as feature representations. They fine-tune the weights of this deep network using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. Additionally, the figure included in the context shows mosaics and coral maps, further supporting the notion that the main data format used is images. Therefore, while other data formats like CSV or video may potentially be involved in the overall process, the primary focus appears to be on image data.
