The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. It primarily focuses on discussing the use of a pretrained model for classifying real multi-spectral (MS) point clouds and the importance of data augmentation in addressing the need for large training datasets in deep neural networks (DNNs).
