The paper by Chalmers et al. (2021) titled "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" discusses the use of deep learning models for analyzing bioacoustic data. However, it does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to develop their model. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine which framework was used to build the deep learning model.
