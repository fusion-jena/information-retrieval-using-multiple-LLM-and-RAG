The paper titled "Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models" by Navares and Aznarte (2020) uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This deep learning model is employed in their proposed pipeline for air quality predictions. Additionally, Chianese et al. (2019) use Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in their study titled "Spatio-temporal learning in predicting ambient particulate matter concentration by multi-layer perceptron." However, it should be noted that MLPs are not considered part of the transformer family but rather belong to the feedforward neural network category.
