Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the authors have taken steps to mitigate potential issues related to data imbalance or bias. For instance, they have mentioned using a limited amount of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018. This suggests that they may have been aware of the need to avoid overrepresentation of certain classes or features in their dataset. Furthermore, they discuss implementing a U-Net model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python, which removes the requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. This could potentially help reduce any inherent biases present in larger datasets. Lastly, they also mention performing hyperparameter optimization to find the best U-Net model, which might include adjustments to account for any data imbalances or biases. While not explicitly stated, these practices suggest that the authors have considered addressing data bias during preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline.

However, without more information about the specific methods employed, it cannot be definitively determined whether stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, or other techniques were utilized to address data bias.
