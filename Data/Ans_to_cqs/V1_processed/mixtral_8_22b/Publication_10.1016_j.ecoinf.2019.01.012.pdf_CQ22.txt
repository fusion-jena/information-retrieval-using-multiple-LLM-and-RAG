The paper uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include Overall Accuracy (OA), Precision (P), Recall (R), F1 score (F1), and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Additionally, they also consider the 'loss', which measures how much the model predictions differ from the actual classes. These metrics are calculated for both the training and validation datasets.
