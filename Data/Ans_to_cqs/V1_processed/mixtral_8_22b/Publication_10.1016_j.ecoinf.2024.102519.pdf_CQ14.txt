According to the given context, the hyperparameters of the genetic optimization algorithm used to identify the optimal Ecological Source Area (ESA) are adjusted using the genetic optimization algorithm itself. This means that the algorithm is used to find the best combination of hyperparameters that will result in the most accurate identification of the optimal ESA.

However, it is not explicitly stated how exactly the hyperparameters are optimized within the genetic optimization algorithm. In general, there are several methods for optimizing hyperparameters, including grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms. Given that the context mentions the use of genetic optimization algorithms, it can be assumed that some form of evolutionary algorithm is being used to optimize the hyperparameters.

In summary, while the exact method for optimizing the hyperparameters is not specified in the given context, it can be inferred that some form of evolutionary algorithm, possibly a genetic algorithm, is being used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
