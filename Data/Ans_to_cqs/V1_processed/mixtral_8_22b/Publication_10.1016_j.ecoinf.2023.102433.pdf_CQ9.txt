The text does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class has specific methods to create daily pipelines for data ingestion and that it uses TensorFlow for deep learning analysis. However, there is no mention of where the data repository is located or what platform is used to store the data. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
