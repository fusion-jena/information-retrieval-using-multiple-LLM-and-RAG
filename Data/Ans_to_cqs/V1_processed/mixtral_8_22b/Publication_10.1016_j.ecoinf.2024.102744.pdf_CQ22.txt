The evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models include Miss Rate (MR), False Alarm Rate (FAR), Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The MR and FAR measure the proportion of missed detections and false alarms, respectively. Precision indicates the ratio of correctly detected positive instances out of all predicted positive instances, while Recall represents the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved. Lastly, the F1-score combines both Precision and Recall into a single metric, providing a balanced assessment of the model's performance.
