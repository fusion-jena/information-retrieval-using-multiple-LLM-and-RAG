The paper does not provide explicit details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a large batch size equal to 128, which could be considered a form of stratified sampling. This approach ensures that the model is exposed to a diverse range of samples within each iteration, potentially reducing any biases caused by imbalanced classes or uneven representation of certain types of data. Additionally, the introduction of eight shortcuts among layers might help mitigate information loss due to the cascading nature of the neural network architecture, thereby preserving more diversity in the processed data. Nonetheless, without direct mention of techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, one cannot definitively state whether these were employed in the study.
