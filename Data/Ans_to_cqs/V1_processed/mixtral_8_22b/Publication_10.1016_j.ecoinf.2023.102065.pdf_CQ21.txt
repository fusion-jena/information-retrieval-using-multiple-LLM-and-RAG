Based on the provided context, it appears that the focus is primarily on the training and fine-tuning processes of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for sound classification. However, the context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer regarding the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix generation. These techniques are often used to evaluate and interpret machine learning models, but their application is not discussed in the provided text.
