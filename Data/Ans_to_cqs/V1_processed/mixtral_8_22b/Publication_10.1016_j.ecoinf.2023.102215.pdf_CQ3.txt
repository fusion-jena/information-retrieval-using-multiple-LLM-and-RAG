The text describes several methods of data annotation used in the creation of the ST-D dataset for studying salient tree trunks. The primary method employed here is pixel-wise semantic segmentation, where each pixel in an image is labeled according to whether or not it belongs to a salient tree trunk. This technique allows for precise identification and delineation of individual tree trunks within the images.

Additionally, the authors mention discarding some images due to their low quality, indicating that manual inspection and filtering were part of the annotation process. They also discuss dividing the dataset randomly into a training set and a testing set using a ratio of 65% to 35%, respectively. However, no other specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are explicitly mentioned in this excerpt.
