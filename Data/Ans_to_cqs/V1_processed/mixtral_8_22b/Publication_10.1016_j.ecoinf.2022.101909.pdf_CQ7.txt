The data was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing with the presence and absence samples. In the training stage, 10% of the dataset was used as a validation subset. It was likely that samples extracted from the same audio file were separated, both for training and for testing and validation. However, this bias was reduced in the semi-automatic labeling stage by limiting the extraction of samples to a maximum of three per file.
