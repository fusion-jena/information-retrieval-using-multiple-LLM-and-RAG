The text does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of cross-validation accuracy as a metric to determine the optimal number of feature combinations. Cross-validation accuracy is a common evaluation metric used in machine learning to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform on unseen data. It involves dividing the original sample into a training set to train the model and a test set to evaluate it. This process is then repeated several times, with different partitions used as the training and test sets. The average error across all trials is computed to produce a single estimation. Although the text does not mention other evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, these could also have been used to further evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
