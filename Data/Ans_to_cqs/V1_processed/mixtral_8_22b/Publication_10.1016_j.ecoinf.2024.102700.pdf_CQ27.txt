Unfortunately, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine what process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. There is no mention of model deployment, serialization, platform selection, or any other details regarding how the trained deep learning model was deployed. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an accurate response to this query.
