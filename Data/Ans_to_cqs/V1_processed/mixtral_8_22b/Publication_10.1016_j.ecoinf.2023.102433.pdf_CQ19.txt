According to the given information, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) uses Tensorflow as its primary framework for performing deep learning analyses. Tensorflow is an open-source framework developed by the Google Brain team. However, it should be noted that since GEE is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), the choice of framework is entirely managed by Google and cannot be modified by individual users. Therefore, other popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), or Caffe are not supported within the GEE platform.
