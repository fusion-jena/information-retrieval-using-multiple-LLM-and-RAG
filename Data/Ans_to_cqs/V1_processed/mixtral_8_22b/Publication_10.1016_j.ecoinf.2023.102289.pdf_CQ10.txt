Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, since LaDeco uses MXNet and GluonCV libraries, one could look into these repositories for more details about the implementation. Here are the links to the official repositories:

* Apache MXNet: <https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet>
* GluonCV: <https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv>
