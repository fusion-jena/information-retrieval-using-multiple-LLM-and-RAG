The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include the following:

1. Train Set: This is the portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns from this data and adjusts its internal parameters accordingly. Typically, around 60-80% of the total data is allocated for training purposes.

2. Test Set: After training the model, it needs to be evaluated using new, unseen data to assess how well it has learned. This evaluation is done using the test set, which should ideally contain data not seen during training. Usually, about 20-30% of the total data is reserved for testing.

3. Validation Set: In addition to the train and test sets, sometimes a third subset called the validation set is created. This set is used during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The validation set is usually derived from the training set itself, with a common practice being to use 10-20% of the training data for validation.

These splits help ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data and does not simply memorize the training examples.
