The method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the given context, involves the use of remote camera traps. These camera traps monitor animals' movements and capture images, which serve as the primary source of data for training the deep learning models. The dataset consists of 33,984 images taken during both day and night, featuring six different animal classes. It is important to note that while the specific details regarding the deployment and placement of these camera traps are not mentioned in the provided context, their usage is crucial for gathering the necessary visual data required for training the deep learning models.
