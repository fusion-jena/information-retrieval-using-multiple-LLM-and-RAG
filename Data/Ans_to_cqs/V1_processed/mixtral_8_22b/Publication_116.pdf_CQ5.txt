The context does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several papers related to deep learning and computer vision, including [31], which discusses going deeper with convolutions, and [33], which delves deep into rectifiers for surpassing human-level performance on ImageNet classification. Additionally, [34] introduces Caffe, a convolutional architecture for fast feature embedding, and [36] explores going deeper in the automated identification of herbarium specimens. While these sources do not explicitly mention the use of popular datasets like MNIST or CIFAR, they suggest that datasets like ImageNet may have been employed due to their relevance to image recognition tasks. Nonetheless, without more specific details from the context, we cannot definitively state which datasets were utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
