Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for identifying animal sounds in soundscape recordings. CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in image recognition and classification tasks. It uses various layers like convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers to learn features from images. While the context doesn't provide details about the optimization techniques used during the training process, typically, these algorithms employ some form of gradient descent optimization method, such as SGD or Adam, to update their weights and minimize the loss function. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state which optimization technique was used based solely on this context, it is reasonable to infer that one of these methods could have been employed.
