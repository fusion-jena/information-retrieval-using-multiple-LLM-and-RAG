The given context does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several BIOCLIM variables related to temperature and precipitation, which could suggest that environmental or meteorological data was collected using sensors or other monitoring devices. Additionally, references to invasive species and modeling species distributions might indicate that biological survey data was also gathered. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the data collection process, we cannot definitively state what methods were employed.
