Handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is crucial to ensure reproducibility and consistency in results. One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value across all experiments. This ensures that any random processes, such as weight initialization or data shuffling, will produce the same result each time the code is run. Another approach is using deterministic algorithms wherever possible, which eliminates the need for random number generation. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation can help reduce variability by averaging results over multiple runs with different subsets of the data. However, it should be noted that some level of randomness may still exist due to factors like hardware variations or non-deterministic operations in certain libraries. Therefore, thorough documentation and reporting of experimental conditions are essential for transparency and replicability.
