The information provided does not include a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper by D. Datta et al. However, it can be noted that the World Agroforestry Centre has its own database which might contain relevant data or resources related to agroforestry. The link to this database is <http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/our_products/databases/>. Additionally, there are other sources cited such as Yang et al.'s article on modeling grassland above-ground biomass using artificial neural networks and remote sensing, but these do not provide any direct links to a deep learning pipeline either. Therefore, without further context or information, it cannot be determined where the deep learning pipeline used in D. Datta et al.'s research is stored or made available.
