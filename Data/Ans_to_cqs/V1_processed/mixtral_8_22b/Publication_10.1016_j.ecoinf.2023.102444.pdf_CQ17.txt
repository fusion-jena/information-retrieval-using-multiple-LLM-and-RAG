Regularization methods are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting and improve generalization capabilities. Two popular regularization methods include Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust to small changes in the inputs. The dropped out neurons do not contribute to both forward pass and backward pass calculations. During testing, all neurons are included, but their outputs are scaled down by the probability of being retained during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty, it encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. In practice, L2 Regularization can be implemented by adding a factor multiplied by the sum of squared weights to the cost function.

These regularization methods help control the complexity of the model, allowing it to better generalize to unseen data while avoiding overfitting to the training dataset.
