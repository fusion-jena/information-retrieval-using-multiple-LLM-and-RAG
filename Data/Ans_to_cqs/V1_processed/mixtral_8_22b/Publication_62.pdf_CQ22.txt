The paper does not explicitly mention which specific evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the deep learning models. However, it is common practice in deep learning applications, particularly in image classification tasks like this one, to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). These metrics help quantify the ability of the model to correctly classify images into their respective categories. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision indicates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Recall shows the proportion of true positives identified out of all actual positives. The F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric using harmonic mean. Lastly, AUROC provides a measure of how well the model distinguishes between different classes. Without explicit information from the paper, these are likely candidates for evaluating the performance of the deep learning models presented.
