The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation was conducted given the statement about the classifier being more accurate at higher taxonomic levels. Common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. Given the nature of the task, it is possible that multiple metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
