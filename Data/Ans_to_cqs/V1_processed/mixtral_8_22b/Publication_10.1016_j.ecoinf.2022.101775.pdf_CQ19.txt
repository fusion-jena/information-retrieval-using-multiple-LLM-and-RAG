The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the described deep learning models. However, it mentions "stochastic gradient descent" as part of the optimization process, which is commonly used in many popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Additionally, there is a reference to a paper titled "Pytorch-BigGraph: A Large-Scale Graph Embedding System," suggesting that PyTorch might have been used in some capacity during the research or development process. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation from the authors or additional context, it cannot be definitively stated which deep learning framework was used to build the deep learning models discussed in the given text.
