The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models mentioned. However, some common practices in machine learning can be inferred from the context. For instance, the use of diverse datasets is implied by the application of these models across various fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification. This suggests that the models were trained and tested on different types of data, contributing to their generalizability.

Moreover, the mention of'remarkable achievements' and'satisfactory classification performance' indicates that the models were evaluated using appropriate metrics, possibly through techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. These methods help prevent overfitting and ensure that the models perform well on unseen data, thereby enhancing their generalizability.

However, without explicit details about the validation strategies employed, it cannot be definitively stated what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of these deep learning models.
