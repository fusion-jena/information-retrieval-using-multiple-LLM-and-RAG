The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within images or videos. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class or category. Instance segmentation is similar to semantic segmentation but also distinguishes individual instances of objects belonging to the same class. Polygon annotation involves creating polygonal shapes around objects of interest within images or videos. Key point annotation involves marking specific points on objects of interest within images or videos. Landmark annotation involves identifying specific facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. These annotations help train machine learning models to recognize patterns and make predictions accurately.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the authors have likely used some form of data annotation technique to train their deep learning models for pest detection and counting research. However, without explicit mention of the specific technique used, we cannot definitively state what type of annotation was employed.
