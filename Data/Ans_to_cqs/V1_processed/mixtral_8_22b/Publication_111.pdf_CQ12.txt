The pipeline uses a deep learning model called GRU-DNN, which stands for Gated Recurrent Units combined with a Regular Neural Network. This model is a variation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) designed to overcome the difficulties of traditional RNNs such as exploding and vanishing gradients. The GRU-DNN model is simpler than Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and has a less sophisticated architecture, making it faster to train and converge. It is used in the pipeline to predict Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) for the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset.
