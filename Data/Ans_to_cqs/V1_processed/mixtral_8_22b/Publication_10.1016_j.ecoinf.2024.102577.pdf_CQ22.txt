The text does not provide information on the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy for all analyzed species. Therefore, we can infer that one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance was accuracy. Other commonly used evaluation metrics for deep learning models include precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under Curve (AUC), among others. Without additional information, it cannot be determined if these or other metrics were also employed.
