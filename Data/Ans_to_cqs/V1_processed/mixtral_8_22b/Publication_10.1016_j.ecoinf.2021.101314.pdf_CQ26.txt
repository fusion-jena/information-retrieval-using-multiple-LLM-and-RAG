Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general insights into handling data imbalance can still be derived from the information provided.

One approach mentioned indirectly is controlling the size of the support of the output redescriptions using various parameters. By requiring that at least 1% of localities satisfy both queries and at most 70% of localities satisfy neither of the queries, the authors aim to capture local patterns without being too restrictive. This could potentially help mitigate issues related to class imbalances in datasets.

Additionally, the concept of redescription mining itself might offer some insight into addressing data bias. Redescription mining combines partitioning techniques like clustering with modeling techniques like regression. It focuses on identifying multiple local models within subsets of data rather than finding global models. This allows for generating explicit and interpretable limiting conditions, which may aid in dealing with data bias.

However, since the context does not directly discuss techniques specifically aimed at addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it cannot provide a comprehensive list of relevant strategies. Some commonly used techniques include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, among others. These methods can help ensure balanced representation across different classes in the dataset, thus reducing potential bias.
