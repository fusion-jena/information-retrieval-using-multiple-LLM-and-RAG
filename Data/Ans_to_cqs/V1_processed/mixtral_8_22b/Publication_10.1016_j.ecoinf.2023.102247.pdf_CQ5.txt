The query asks about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, but the given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning pipelines or the datasets used within them. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer the query based solely on the provided context. However, some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is grayscale and has been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

CIFAR is a dataset containing 60,000 color images in 10 classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are two versions of the dataset: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. CIFAR-10 contains 6,000 images per class, while CIFAR-100 contains 600 images per class.

ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing over 14 million labeled images belonging to roughly 22,000 categories. It was created for use in visual object recognition software research.

Again, without additional context, it cannot be determined which, if any, of these datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
