The deep learning model mentioned in the given context uses the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The loss function employed for this model is Mean Squared Error (MSE). For optimization, the ADAM algorithm is utilized, proposed by Kingma and Ba (2015).

To prevent overfitting, a dropout layer is incorporated into the model. Dropout layers work by randomly excluding certain inputs from activations and weight updates during the training process. This technique helps improve the generalizability of the model. As per Ozg√ºr and Nar (2020), inputs not excluded are scaled up by 1/(1 - rate) to maintain the overall input sum.

However, the exact learning rate or other hyperparameters related to the ADAM optimizer are not explicitly stated in the provided context. Additionally, no information regarding batch sizes, epoch numbers, or any other potential hyperparameters is included. Therefore, based solely on the given context, the precise hyperparameter settings remain unknown.
