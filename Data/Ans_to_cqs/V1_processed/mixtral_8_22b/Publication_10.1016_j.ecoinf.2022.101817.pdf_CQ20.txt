Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, we do have details about various hardware platforms like AMD Ryzen, Intel Core i7, Cortex-A57, Raspberry Pi 4, and MediaTek Pumpkin i500, along with their respective performance metrics. These hardware platforms could potentially be used for training deep learning models depending on their capabilities and requirements. To determine the exact hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, additional information would be needed.
