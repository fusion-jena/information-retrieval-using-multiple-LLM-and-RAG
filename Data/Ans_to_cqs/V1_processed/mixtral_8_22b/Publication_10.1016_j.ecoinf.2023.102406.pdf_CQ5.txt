The dataset used in this case is not explicitly mentioned as being part of a deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used pertains to climate variables related to tree life spans in North America. Specifically, the author mentions using climatologies during 1900â€“1990 provided by CHELSA-TraCE21k v1.0 (Karger et al., 2020, 2021). This dataset includes various temperature and precipitation measurements such as Annual Mean Temperature, Max Temperature Warmest Month, Min Temperature Coldest Month, etc. Therefore, while not directly comparable to popular deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, this dataset provides valuable environmental data relevant to the study of ecology and tree life spans.
