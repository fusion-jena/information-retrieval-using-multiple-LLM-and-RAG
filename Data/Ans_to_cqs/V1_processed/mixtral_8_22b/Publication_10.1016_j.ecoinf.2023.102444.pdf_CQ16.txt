The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for either the UMAP or MaxEnt models. However, it can be inferred that some form of performance evaluation must have been conducted on the training and testing datasets to assess the accuracy of these models. Commonly used criteria for determining when training is complete include reaching a minimum threshold for validation loss, achieving a maximum level of accuracy, or observing no further improvement in performance metrics over several iterations. Without additional context, it cannot be definitively stated which, if any, of these criteria were applied during the training process for the UMAP and MaxEnt models.
