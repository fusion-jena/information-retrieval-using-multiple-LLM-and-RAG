Based on the given context, it appears that the hyperparameters of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model were optimized using stochastic gradient descent with the Adam optimizer. This optimization method uses weight decay. Specifically, the learning rate was adjusted to find an optimal configuration of Î· = 0.0005. Additionally, annealing was applied to this learning rate by a factor of 100 using a cosine function over the duration of the training. However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques such as grid search or random search being employed for hyperparameter tuning in the provided context.
