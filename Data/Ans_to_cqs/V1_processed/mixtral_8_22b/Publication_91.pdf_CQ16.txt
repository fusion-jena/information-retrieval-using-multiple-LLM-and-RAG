The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing no further improvement in validation loss or accuracy over several epochs (also known as a validation loss plateau), or meeting a predefined threshold for a chosen metric such as accuracy or F-score. In this case, since the learning rate is exponentially decayed every 3 epochs, one potential criterion could be monitoring the model's performance after each decay period and stopping the training if there is no significant improvement.
