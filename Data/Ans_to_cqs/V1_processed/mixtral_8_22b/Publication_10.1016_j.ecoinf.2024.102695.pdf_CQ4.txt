Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, I can provide some general examples of common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and adding noise. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping images, which helps the model learn more robust features. Rotation involves rotating images by various degrees, helping the model understand that objects remain the same despite their orientation. Scaling changes the size of images, allowing the model to recognize objects regardless of their scale. Cropping removes portions of images, encouraging the model to focus on important features. Padding adds extra pixels around images, maintaining consistent dimensions across inputs. Lastly, adding noise introduces random variations into images, improving the model's ability to handle real-world imperfections.
