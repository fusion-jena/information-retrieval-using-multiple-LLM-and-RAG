The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for identifying bird calls using the BirdNET app. However, it can be assumed that common optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) could have been employed during the training process of the deep learning model. These optimization algorithms help minimize the loss function and improve the accuracy of predictions made by the model. Without further details from the authors, it cannot be confirmed which specific optimization technique was utilized in their work.
