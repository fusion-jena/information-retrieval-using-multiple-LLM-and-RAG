The given context does not provide information about the specific code repository link of any deep learning pipeline mentioned. However, based on the references cited in the text, it can be assumed that some of them might have publicly available code repositories. To find out more details, one could look into the respective papers or contact the authors directly. Here are some potential sources:

* Xie et al.'s work on comparing different features for bird species classification (Xie and Zhu, 2019): This paper discusses using LEAF-P and SincNet-P as learnable frontends for bird species recognition. While no direct links to code repositories are provided in the context, searching for relevant publications by the same authors may lead to finding associated code repositories.
* Kahl et al.'s research on large-scale bioacoustics analysis (Kahl et al., 2021): Although this reference is mentioned in the context, there is no explicit mention of a specific deep learning pipeline or code repository. Again, looking into the original publication or reaching out to the authors might reveal further information.
* Stowell's work on deep learning methods for large-scale bioacoustics analysis (Stowell, 2022): Similar to the previous points, while this reference is mentioned in the context, there is no direct indication of a specific code repository. Investigating the original source material or getting in touch with the author could potentially uncover additional resources.
