The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, it mentions that a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model was chosen for extracting features from the dataset containing 500 honey bee images. Before feeding these images into the pre-trained model, some common preprocessing techniques might have been applied, such as image resizing, normalization, and augmentation. Image resizing ensures that all images have consistent dimensions, while normalization scales pixel values between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1, which helps stabilize the learning process. Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and cropping could also have been employed to increase the size of the dataset artificially and improve the model's robustness. Nevertheless, without further details, we cannot confirm the exact preprocessing steps performed in this particular scenario.
