The given context does not provide information about which specific framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that a grid search approach was adopted to optimize the Random Forest (RF) model. This suggests that the authors might have used Python libraries such as Scikit-learn or NumPy for implementing their models. Unfortunately, without explicit mention of the framework used, I cannot definitively state whether they used TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework.
