Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about handling randomness specifically related to the deep learning pipeline or random seed values. However, one strategy mentioned to address randomness is using random sampling when dividing the dataset into training and testing sets. This approach ensures that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and minimises the risk of bias. By leveraging randomization, the distribution of key features and target variables is preserved across both training and test sets, enhancing the generalizability of the model. Additionally, the use of cross-validation techniques like five-fold cross-validation further contributes to managing randomness in the model development process.
