In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we can infer that some form of annotation was performed since the authors state that they had to deal with annotation errors. They also mention using a revalidated annotation for their results. Therefore, while the exact technique remains unclear, it appears that the researchers did use some type of data annotation methodology in their deep learning pipeline.
