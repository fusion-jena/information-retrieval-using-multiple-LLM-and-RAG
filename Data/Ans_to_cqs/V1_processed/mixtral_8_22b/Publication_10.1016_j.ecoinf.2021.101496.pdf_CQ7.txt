The given text mentions that the dataset is divided into a "training dataset" and a "testing dataset". This division is done for the purpose of SPAD value modeling. Specifically, the "training dataset" contains 60 randomly selected records, while the "remaining 29 records" form the "testing dataset". It can be inferred that the division of the dataset into these subsets is done randomly, without any specific criteria mentioned in the given text. However, it should be noted that in general, when splitting datasets for machine learning or deep learning purposes, there are several common strategies. One such strategy is to use a fixed percentage of the data for training (e.g., 70%) and the rest for testing (e.g., 30%). Another strategy is to use a fixed number of samples for training and testing. In some cases, a separate validation set may also be created to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. However, the specific criteria used for splitting the data will depend on the particular problem and dataset being studied.
