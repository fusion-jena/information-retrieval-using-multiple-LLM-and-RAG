The text does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, it discusses several strategies and methods applied to optimize the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture and parameters.

One key aspect mentioned is the use of the trial-and-error method to find the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate. This involves varying these parameters and calculating the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data for each configuration. By doing so, they aim to identify the combination of parameters that results in the highest model performance.

Additionally, the authors employ an early stopping technique to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model performs exceptionally well on the training dataset but poorly on unseen data due to excessive complexity. Early stopping helps mitigate this issue by halting the training process once the model starts to overfit the data, typically determined by monitoring the error on a separate validation set.

While these approaches contribute to improving the overall performance of the ANN, they do not directly correspond to traditional optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. These optimization algorithms are often utilized during the backpropagation phase of training deep learning models to minimize the loss function effectively. Nonetheless, the described methods still play a crucial role in fine-tuning the ANN architecture and achieving better predictions.
