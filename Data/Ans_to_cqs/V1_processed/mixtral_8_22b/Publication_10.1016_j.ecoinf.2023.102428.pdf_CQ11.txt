Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have used publicly accessible datasets from sources such as USGS EarthExplorer [2] and OpenStreetMap [3]. To find more specific details about the dataset used in this study, I recommend checking the original paper or reaching out to the corresponding author(s) directly.
