Based on the given context, one preprocessing step that is involved before training a deep learning model is data augmentation. This technique is applied to all extracted patches, including a 90Â° rotation and vertical and horizontal flips. However, the context does not provide information about other common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. These steps may still be part of the process but are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
