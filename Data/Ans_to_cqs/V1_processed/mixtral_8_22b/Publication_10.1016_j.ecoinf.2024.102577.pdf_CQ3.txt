The provided context does not contain information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help label or categorize objects within images or videos, which can then be used to train machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The choice of technique depends on the specific application and the desired output. For example, bounding boxes may be sufficient for object detection tasks, while instance segmentation might be necessary for more detailed analysis like identifying individual fish species in underwater footage.
