Based on the given information, it appears that the authors are using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. This can be inferred from the table titled "Optimal MLP Architecture and Parameters" where each layer of the model is described along with its respective size. Additionally, the use of dense layers, batch normalization layers, and dropout layers further supports this conclusion. However, there is no mention of any other types of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the available information, we can conclude that the authors are using an MLP model in their pipeline.
