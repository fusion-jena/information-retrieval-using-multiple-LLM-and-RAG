The context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mention of "panda facial images" and the reference to VGG nets being successful in "image recognition," it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely to be images. Additionally, the calculation of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values suggests that the output of the deep learning pipeline is numerical, possibly representing predicted ages or other related metrics. Therefore, while the exact data format cannot be confirmed without additional context, it appears that the input data consists of images, and the output data is numerical.
