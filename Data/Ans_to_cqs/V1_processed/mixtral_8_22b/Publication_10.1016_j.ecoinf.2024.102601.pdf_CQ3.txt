The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of machine learning (ML) models and the optimization of data structures for ML classification tasks. In particular, the focus is on selecting relevant predictors from S2 imagery and integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques. For hyperparameter optimization, the study employs RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV methods from the scikit-learn library to improve the performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. These methods help navigate large hyperparameter spaces and incorporate prior knowledge during exploration.

Therefore, while the context does not directly address the query, it can be inferred that some form of data labeling or annotation would have been necessary to train and evaluate these ML models. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation for object detection tasks, semantic segmentation for pixel-level image classification, and instance segmentation for detecting individual objects within images. However, without further context, it cannot be determined if any of these specific techniques were employed in this study.
