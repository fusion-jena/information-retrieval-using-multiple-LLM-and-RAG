Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, whether through methods like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the method used for hyperparameter optimization in this particular scenario.
