To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was collected from various sources to capture different aspects of the problem domain. This helped prevent overfitting and improved the robustness of the model. Secondly, cross-validation was employed during training to further reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Lastly, stratified splitting was utilized to maintain class balance within each fold of the cross-validation process, ensuring that the model learned equally well from all classes present in the dataset. These techniques combined allowed for the development of a highly generalizable deep learning model capable of accurately predicting outcomes across a wide range of scenarios.
