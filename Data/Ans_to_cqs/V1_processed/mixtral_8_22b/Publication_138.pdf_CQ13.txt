Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models mentioned (ICSNet, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet152). However, it does provide some details about other aspects of these models. For instance, it mentions the use of inception modules in ICSNet and GoogLeNet, the addition of more convolutional layers in ICSNet compared to AlexNet, and the varying number of layers across different models. Additionally, it provides information about the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, min-batch size, and time taken by each algorithm. But without explicit mention of the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters, it is not possible to determine what values were used for them.
