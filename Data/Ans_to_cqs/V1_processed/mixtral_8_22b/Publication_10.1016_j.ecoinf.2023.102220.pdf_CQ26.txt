The text does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning pipelines, some possible techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets with imbalanced classes. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. These techniques can help improve the performance of models trained on imbalanced datasets.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and perspectives to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

Again, these techniques are not mentioned specifically in the given context, but they are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address data bias during preprocessing.
