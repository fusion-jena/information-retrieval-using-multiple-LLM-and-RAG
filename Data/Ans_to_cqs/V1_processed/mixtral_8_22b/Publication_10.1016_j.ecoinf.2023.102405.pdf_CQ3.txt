Based on the given context, it appears that the focus of the study is on water contamination in aquaculture and the development of a comprehensive framework for classifying water quality using IoT-based data collection and segregation. However, there is no specific mention or discussion of any particular data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the data annotation techniques used in this specific case.
