Based on the given context, it appears that the research primarily involves the use of remote sensing images, specifically Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May. These images are likely in a standard image format such as.jpg or.png. Additionally, Level 2A atmospherically and radiometrically corrected bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance products are also mentioned, suggesting the use of geospatial data formats commonly associated with satellite imagery. However, the exact file format is not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, while we can infer that image data is being used, the specific file format remains unknown without further information.
