The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that they used different numbers of training steps to find optima for training TensorFlow. This suggests that they might have employed some form of parameter tuning or optimization technique such as grid search or random search. Grid search is a methodical approach where one tries all possible combinations of parameters within a predefined range, while random search involves randomly selecting values from a given distribution. Without further details, it cannot be definitively stated which specific method was utilized.
