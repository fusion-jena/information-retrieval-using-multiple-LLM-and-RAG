Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that one of the challenges in creating and utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for bioacoustic research questions is the consuming step involving exploring various neural network hyperparameters to obtain the most optimal model. This suggests that some form of optimization technique such as grid search or random search might have been employed to find the best set of hyperparameters. Unfortunately, without more specific details about the methodology used, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact optimization technique utilized.
