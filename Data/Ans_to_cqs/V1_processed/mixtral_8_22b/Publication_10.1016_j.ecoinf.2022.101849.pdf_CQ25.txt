The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, one can infer that the deep learning model might be used for classification purposes. This is because the text mentions that the authors evaluated different machine learning methods, including neural networks (a type of deep learning method), for Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV) mapping in a classification setting. Therefore, it can be assumed that the deep learning model was intended for classifying different types of vegetation or land cover classes. Nevertheless, without additional context, it cannot be confirmed if the deep learning model was also used for other tasks like segmentation or object detection.
