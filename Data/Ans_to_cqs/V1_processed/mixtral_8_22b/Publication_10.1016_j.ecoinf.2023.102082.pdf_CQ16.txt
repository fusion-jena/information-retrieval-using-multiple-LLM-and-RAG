The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the Potapov30m model. However, it mentions that the authors used a regression tree algorithm, which often involves monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy to decide when to stop training. Common stopping criteria include reaching a predefined number of epochs, early stopping based on no improvement in validation loss/accuracy over several epochs, or achieving a target performance level. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about the training process, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete for this particular model.
