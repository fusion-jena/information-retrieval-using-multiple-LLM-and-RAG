The given text does not provide any direct information about the use of a deep learning model or any specific measures taken to ensure its generalizability. However, we can infer that the study involves data analysis and modeling related to forest management, specifically focusing on reducing the index variance using different estimators such as NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4.

In terms of ensuring the generalizability of models, common practices include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, one can assume that similar strategies might have been employed during the development and evaluation of their models. For instance, the authors may have used multiple datasets from various forest types or regions to train and validate their models, thereby increasing their applicability across different scenarios. Additionally, they might have utilized cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques to assess the performance and robustness of their models.

However, without further details regarding the methodology or specific steps taken to develop and evaluate the models, it is impossible to definitively state whether these measures were implemented.
