The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for deep learning. Specifically, it employs various CNN architectures such as Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121. These models are initialized with ImageNet weights and then fine-tuned on the specific dataset. The best performing model was found to be Inception-V3, which had a macro average F1 score of 0.93 and a relatively small size of 175 MB, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.
