After model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics such as overall accuracy, kappa index, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned to classify the data. In this case, we see that the authors have calculated both overall accuracy and kappa index for different methods (see Table 3).

2. Visualization of results: Creating visual representations of the classified data, such as thematic maps or scatter plots, which can aid in understanding the distribution of classes across the study area. Figure 4 shows examples of classified maps produced by four different methods.

3. Confusion matrices: Generating confusion matrices to understand the misclassifications between different classes. This helps identify patterns in errors made by the model and can guide further improvements. Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, confusion matrices could potentially be created based on the available information.

4. Saliency maps: Highlighting important regions within input data that contribute significantly to the final output decision. While saliency maps are more commonly associated with deep learning models, they may still be relevant when working with other types of models like those presented here. However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context.
