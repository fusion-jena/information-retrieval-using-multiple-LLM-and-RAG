In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does discuss the use of weight decay with the Lagrange multiplier Î» in the loss function, which is another form of regularization. Weight decay is equivalent to L2 regularization, where the goal is to reduce the size of the weights to avoid overfitting. This method adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights. Additionally, the text mentions fine-tuning the entire network only when the new dataset is large enough, suggesting that transfer learning and freezing early layers might also help prevent overfitting. These techniques allow the reuse of learned features from larger datasets while avoiding significant changes to the first layers, which may lead to overfitting if updated with small datasets.
