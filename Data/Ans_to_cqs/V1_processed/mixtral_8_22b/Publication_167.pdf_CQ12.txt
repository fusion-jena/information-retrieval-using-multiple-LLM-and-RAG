The paper uses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This model is not explicitly mentioned as being a specific type of deep learning model like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, since the MLP model has multiple hidden layers, it can still be considered a form of deep learning.

In summary, the pipeline employs a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, which falls under the category of deep learning due to its multiple hidden layers.
