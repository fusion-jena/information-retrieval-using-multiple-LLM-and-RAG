The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training. However, typically, the data is divided into three sets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. The validation set is often used to tune hyperparameters or select the best model architecture. Common methods for splitting the data include random sampling or stratified sampling based on class labels. It is also important to ensure that the splits maintain similar distributions of classes to avoid bias in the model's predictions.
