Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of validation process is applied to the data before being loaded onto the Access tier. Additionally, the use of incremental ETL procedures suggests that data transformation processes are employed, but the exact nature of these transformations or any potential bias mitigation strategies are not specified. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
