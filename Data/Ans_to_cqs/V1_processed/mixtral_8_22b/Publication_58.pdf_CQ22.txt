The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using four quality metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), User Accuracy (UA), and the F1-score. The OA takes the sum of the diagonal of the confusion matrix. The PA takes the number of well-ranked individuals divided by the sum of the column in the confusion matrix. The UA takes the number of well-ranked individuals divided by the sum of the line. Finally, the F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. This last metric allows calculating the accuracy of a model by giving an equal importance between the PA and the UA.
