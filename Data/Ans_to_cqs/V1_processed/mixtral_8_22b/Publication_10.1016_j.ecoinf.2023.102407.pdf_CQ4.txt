The text does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation is done using Deep Transfer (DT), which could potentially involve various techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. The process involves retraining the teacher model using augmented DT and generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. This is done every 100 epochs and continues until the number of epochs for training the student model reaches a predefined value. This incremental data augmentation helps improve the accuracy of both the teacher and student models, leading to more accurate predictions of species distribution.
