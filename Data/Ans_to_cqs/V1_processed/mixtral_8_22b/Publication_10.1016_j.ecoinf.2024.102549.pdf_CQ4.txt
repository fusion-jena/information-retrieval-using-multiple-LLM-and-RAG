Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalizability of the model. It is possible that similar techniques were employed in this study, but without explicit mention, we cannot confirm their use.
