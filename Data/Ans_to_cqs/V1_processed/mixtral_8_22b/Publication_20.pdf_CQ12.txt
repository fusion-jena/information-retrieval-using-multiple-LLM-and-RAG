The study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the GoogLeNet architecture, which won the ImageNet competition in 2015. GoogLeNet is a complex neural network consisting of 22 layers and incorporating inception modules. These modules enable the network to utilize convolutions of different sizes (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 pixels) and assign weights to each convolution. By doing so, the network can consider varying degrees of context around each pixel, thereby increasing the potential for improved performance during training.
