The given context does not provide specific details regarding the data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and zooming. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and improve model performance by introducing variations into the dataset. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the input data.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have developed a method for creating colorblind-friendly images using the programming language R. While this approach could potentially be integrated into a larger machine learning pipeline, the text does not discuss its use within a deep learning framework or mention any specific data augmentation techniques employed. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state what data augmentation techniques were used in this case, we can describe some commonly used methods in similar applications.
