To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained using a diverse dataset consisting of presence-only observations for multiple species. This multi-species approach helps to capture a wide range of patterns and relationships between species and their environment, improving the model's ability to generalize to new situations.

Secondly, the use of deep learning techniques allows the model to learn from complex effects and interactions between environmental predictors. Deep learning algorithms can identify intricate patterns within large datasets, which is particularly useful when dealing with the increasing volume of data generated by citizen science observations and remote sensing technologies.

Lastly, although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, it is reasonable to assume that some form of validation or evaluation technique would have been employed during the development of the model. Cross-validation or stratified splitting could have been used to assess the performance of the model across different subsets of the data, ensuring its robustness and generalizability. However, without specific details regarding the validation methods used, it cannot be confirmed if these particular techniques were implemented.
