Based on the given context, I cannot provide specific information regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, I can explain some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models.

Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before starting the learning process. Some examples include:

1. Learning Rate: Determines how much the weights should be updated during backpropagation. A high learning rate may cause the model to converge faster but might overshoot the optimal solution, while a low learning rate may take longer to converge but provides more stability.

2. Optimizer: An optimization algorithm used to update the weights of the network. Commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSProp, and Adagrad. Each optimizer has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the nature of the problem being solved.

3. Batch Size: Refers to the number of samples processed together before updating the weights. Larger batch sizes require more memory but offer a more stable convergence, while smaller batch sizes allow for quicker updates and can help escape local minima.

4. Number of Layers and Neurons: Defining the architecture of the neural network involves deciding the number of hidden layers and neurons within those layers. More complex architectures may improve performance but also increase computational requirements and risk overfitting.

5. Activation Function: Used to introduce non-linearity into the output of a layer. Examples include ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, and softmax functions. Different activation functions serve different purposes and can affect the overall performance of the model.

Without additional context, I am unable to specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the query.
