The text does not explicitly state the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the target PSI, which is being classified using the trained model, has the same format as the trained PSI. It further explains that this format refers to the spatial resolution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order of each band. Given these details, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is likely related to satellite imagery or remote sensing data, considering the mention of spatial resolution, spectral bands, and intervals. Furthermore, the reference to Kim et al.'s (2021a) research suggests that the authors might have employed similar methods involving satellite images. Additionally, the paper cites other studies focusing on satellite imagery analysis and deep learning applications in remote sensing. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely satellite imagery or remote sensing data.
