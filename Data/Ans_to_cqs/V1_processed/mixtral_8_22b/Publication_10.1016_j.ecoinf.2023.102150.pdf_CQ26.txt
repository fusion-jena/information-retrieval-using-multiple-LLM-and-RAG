The papers provided do not explicitly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in deep learning, several methods can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in both sets. This ensures that each subset is representative of the overall population, reducing potential biases caused by uneven class distributions.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets containing imbalanced classes. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating their instances or generating synthetic samples. Undersampling reduces the majority class size by randomly removing some instances or selecting only those most informative ones. Both approaches aim to create balanced datasets, which can improve model performance when dealing with imbalanced data.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of examples from different sources, environments, and conditions. By incorporating various types of data, models become more robust and better equipped to handle real-world scenarios where input diversity is common.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline often involves employing strategies such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. While these techniques were not directly discussed in the given references, they remain relevant and widely adopted practices within the field of deep learning.
