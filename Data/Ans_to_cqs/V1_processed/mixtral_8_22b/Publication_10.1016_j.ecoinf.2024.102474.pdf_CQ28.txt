Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the models were implemented using the deep learning framework PyTorch Lightning, which is built on top of PyTorch. However, there is no mention of any cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used for deployment. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
