The text does not provide explicit details about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of online spectral libraries and other remote sensing products, which suggests that satellite or airborne imagery might be one source of data collection. Additionally, the authors discuss using NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) and massive training datasets, implying that publicly available datasets could also contribute to the raw data collection process. Ground truth data is mentioned as well, indicating that field surveys or observations might play a role in validating or supplementing the collected data.
