The given context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or AUC-ROC; creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier; generating saliency maps to understand the importance of each feature in the decision-making process; and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. In the case of Support Vector Machines (SVM), one might calculate the margin width, support vectors, and kernel coefficients as part of the postprocessing analysis. For Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), one could analyze the U-matrix, component planes, and cluster structure. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the model used in the study, these suggestions remain speculative.
