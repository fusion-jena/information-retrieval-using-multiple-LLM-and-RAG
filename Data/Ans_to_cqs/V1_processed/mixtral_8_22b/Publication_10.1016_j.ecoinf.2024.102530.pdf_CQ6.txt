Before training a deep learning model, there are several preprocessing steps that can be taken to improve its performance. These include:

* Normalization: This involves rescaling the features so they have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. This helps ensure that all features contribute equally to the final prediction.
* Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the range of feature values. Common methods include min-max scaling and logarithmic scaling.
* Cleaning: Data cleaning involves removing or correcting errors, outliers, and missing values in the dataset. This step ensures that the model is trained on accurate and reliable data.
* Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from existing ones, such as combining multiple columns into a single column or extracting relevant information from text data.
* Dimensionality reduction: In cases where the number of features is very high, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the complexity of the model.
