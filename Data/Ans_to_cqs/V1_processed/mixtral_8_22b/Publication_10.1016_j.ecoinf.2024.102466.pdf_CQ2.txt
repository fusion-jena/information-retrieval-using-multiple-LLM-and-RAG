Based on the given information, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the dataset consists of 9717 images of 15 wild bird species acquired by camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. These images were then utilized to evaluate the performance of eight different deep learning algorithms for bird object detection. While other types of data may have been used in the broader project or related studies, based solely on the provided context, it seems that images are the main data format being discussed here.
