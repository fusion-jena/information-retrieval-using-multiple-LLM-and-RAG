The given context does not provide any direct information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and its use of APIs through the SILIC web service, but it doesn't mention anything specific about the location of the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on this context.
