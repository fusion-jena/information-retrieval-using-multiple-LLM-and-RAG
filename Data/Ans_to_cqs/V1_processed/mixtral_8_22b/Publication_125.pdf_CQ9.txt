Unfortunately, there isn't enough context to provide a specific answer to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The given text does not mention any details about the data repository or where it might be located. It only discusses the use of deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), DenseNet121, and others for processing satellite images while maintaining privacy concerns related to data. To find out more about the data repository, additional context would be required.
