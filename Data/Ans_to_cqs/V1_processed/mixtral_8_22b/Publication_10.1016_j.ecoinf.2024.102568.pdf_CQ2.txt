Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the study focuses on air quality prediction using historical data, it can be inferred that the data format used would likely be structured data, such as CSV or similar tabular formats. This assumption is further supported by the mention of using a MinMaxScaler for preprocessing the training set, which is typically applied to numerical data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is most likely structured data like CSV.
