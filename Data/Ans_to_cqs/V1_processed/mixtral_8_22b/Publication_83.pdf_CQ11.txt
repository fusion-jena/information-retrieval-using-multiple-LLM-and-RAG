Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline or its corresponding data repository. However, I can suggest looking through the references mentioned in the text, such as [23], [24], and [27], as they might contain more specific details about the datasets and resources used in their respective studies. Additionally, searching for related publications by J. Xie and his colleagues could also lead to finding relevant links or repositories containing the required information.
