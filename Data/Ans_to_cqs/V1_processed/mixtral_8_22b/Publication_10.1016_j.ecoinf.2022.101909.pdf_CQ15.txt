The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training was successful, indicating that some form of optimization was employed during the process. Commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. Without further details, it cannot be determined which specific optimization technique was utilized in this study.
