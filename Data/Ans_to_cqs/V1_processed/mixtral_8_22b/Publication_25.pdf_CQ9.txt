The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is stated that all the data are publicly available on the NEON Data Portal (<http://data.neonscience.org/>). Additionally, the paper mentions that all code for this project is available on GitHub (<https://github.com/weecology/DeepLidar>) and archived on Zenodo. Therefore, while there isn't a direct mention of where the dataset itself is stored, one could infer that the data might also be accessible through these platforms or directly linked within them.
