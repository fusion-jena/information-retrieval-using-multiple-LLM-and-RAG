In this study, the complete sample set was randomly split into two parts: 70% and 30%, which were assigned for training and validation, respectively. The early stopping criterion, also known as "patience" in Keras, was set to 50 epochs during training. This means if after 50 epochs the validation accuracy did not increase, the training process would be halted. For the training and validation sets, the number of samples included those generated through a data augmentation procedure. Additionally, all samples containing any no-data values were excluded from the analysis. The resulting network was then tested in the remaining region (e.g., C). This experiment was repeated three times until each of the three regions had a semantic segmentation result from the cross-validation approach. Table 2 shows the number of samples used in each experiment.
