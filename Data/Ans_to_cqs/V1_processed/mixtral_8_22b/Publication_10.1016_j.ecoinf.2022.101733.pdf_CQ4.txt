The given context does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given context what specific data augmentation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
