In this study, the deep learning pipeline primarily utilizes optical imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery data formats. Specifically, the researchers employed GF-1 optical imagery, which consists of multispectral images captured by a wide-format WFV camera. These images contain four bands - blue, green, red, and near-infrared - with a spatial resolution of 16 meters. Additionally, they also incorporated GF-3 SAR imagery, although the specific details regarding its format are not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Furthermore, the study uses MODIS NDVI imagery, derived from the MOD09Q1 dataset, with a resolution of 250 meters and an interval of eight days. This dataset is later processed and resampled to match the 16-meter resolution of the GF-1 images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline in this research predominantly employs image data formats.
