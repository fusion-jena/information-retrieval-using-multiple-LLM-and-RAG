Before training a deep learning model such as a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), several preprocessing steps may be necessary depending on the nature of the dataset. These steps often include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the data so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This step is crucial because many machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range. Scaling ensures that all features contribute proportionately to the final output. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent values within the dataset. It might involve removing outliers, filling missing values, or correcting errors. However, based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps applied to this particular dataset before training the VAE. Therefore, while these are common practices, we cannot definitively state what preprocessing steps were undertaken here without further details.
