In the field of permafrost research, various methods are employed to collect raw data for use in deep learning pipelines. These can include both traditional and modern techniques.

Surveys are a common method used to gather information about permafrost conditions. This could involve ground surveys where researchers physically visit sites to take measurements and observations, or it might involve remote sensing surveys using satellite or airborne imagery. Surveys can provide valuable insights into factors such as snow depth, soil density, solar radiation, thermal conductivity, and vegetation height.

Sensors also play a crucial role in data collection. In situ sensors can be installed directly within the permafrost to measure parameters like soil temperature, water content, and the depth of frost penetration. Remote sensors, such as those mounted on satellites or drones, can capture broader scale data on variables like land cover, terrain features, and climate conditions.

Public datasets are another important resource for permafrost research. Organizations like NASA and the European Space Agency make vast amounts of Earth observation data freely available online. These datasets can include historical records as well as real-time data streams, providing a wealth of information for training deep learning models.

Moreover, citizen science initiatives can contribute significantly to data collection efforts. For instance, local residents living near permafrost areas may participate in monitoring programs, helping scientists track changes over time.

Overall, the choice of data collection method depends largely on the specific requirements of the project. A combination of different approaches often yields the most comprehensive dataset for deep learning applications in permafrost research.
