The text does not provide explicit information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that a training dataset was generated by randomly selecting 500 survey images. These images were then tiled into 864 x 864 subimages and processed through a version of the YOLO Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset provided by Redmon & Farhadi (2018). This suggests that the model was trained on diverse data, as the COCO dataset contains images with various objects and scenes. Additionally, the mention of filtering the citizen science counts implies that some form of validation might have been performed to improve the reliability and robustness of the model. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were specifically applied to enhance the model's generalizability.
