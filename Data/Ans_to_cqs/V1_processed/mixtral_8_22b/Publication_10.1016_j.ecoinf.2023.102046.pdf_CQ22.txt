To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, several metrics are used. These include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision calculates the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall determines the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the actual number of positives. The F1-score combines both precision and recall into a single metric, providing a more balanced view of the model's performance. Additionally, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used as an alternative performance metric.
