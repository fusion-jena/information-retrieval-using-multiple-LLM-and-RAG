The text does not explicitly mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used some form of monitoring based on the evaluation metrics mentioned in section 5.2.1. Classification Performances. They assessed the performances of the networks with precision, recall, and F1-score at training, validation, and testing times. Additionally, they computed these metrics at both micro and macro levels. Micro-F1, precision, and recall were computed across all classes given their distribution on the whole dataset, while macro statistics placed equal weight on all classes. Therefore, it can be assumed that the authors monitored the model performance during training using these evaluation metrics.
