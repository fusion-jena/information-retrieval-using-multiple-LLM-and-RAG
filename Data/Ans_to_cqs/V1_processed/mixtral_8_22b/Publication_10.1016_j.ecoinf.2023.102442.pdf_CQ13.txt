The papers cited do not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in their respective deep learning models. However, some general insights can still be gleaned from them. For instance, Gallwey et al. (2020) discuss using a multispectral convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana but do not mention any specific hyperparameters. Similarly, Couttenier et al. (2022) describe mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at large scales from space with deep learning, yet no details regarding hyperparameters are given.

In contrast, Gorelick et al. (2017) present Google Earth Engine, a platform designed for planetary-scale geospatial analysis, without discussing any particular deep learning models or their associated hyperparameters. The other sources mentioned focus on various aspects of environmental research, such as Amazonian forest phenology (Girardin et al., 2016), large-scale degradation of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems (Castello & Macedo, 2016), and a global increase in sediment loads in tropical rivers due to alluvial mining (Dethier et al., 2023). These studies also do not explicitly address the use of deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters employed in these deep learning models. To obtain more detailed information, one would need access to the original code implementations or further publications related specifically to the deep learning components of these projects.
