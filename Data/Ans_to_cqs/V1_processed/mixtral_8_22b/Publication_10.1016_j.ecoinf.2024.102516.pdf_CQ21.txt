The given context does not provide explicit details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on general machine learning practices and the mentioned use of class activation mapping (CAM) in generating weak segmentation maps during the training process, one could infer potential postprocessing steps. These might include creating saliency maps from CAM outputs to visualize important regions contributing to the model's decisions. Additionally, calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., may help evaluate the model's performance. A confusion matrix could also be generated to understand false positives and negatives better. Nevertheless, specific postprocessing steps depend on the project requirements and objectives.
