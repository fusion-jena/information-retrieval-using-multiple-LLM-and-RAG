To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model does not become biased towards any particular class due to uneven representation.

Oversampling is a technique used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has significantly fewer samples than others. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class until it reaches a similar number as the majority class. Alternatively, synthetic samples can be generated using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Overpopulation Technique).

Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the number of instances in the majority class to match those in the minority class. However, this method may lead to loss of valuable information since some relevant data points might get discarded.

Diverse data collection aims at gathering more representative and balanced datasets by including various sources, demographics, or scenarios. By doing so, models trained on such datasets will likely perform better across different populations and conditions.

These techniques help mitigate data bias and improve the performance and generalizability of deep learning models.
