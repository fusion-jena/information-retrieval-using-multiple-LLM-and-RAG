In this study, the optimization technique employed is not one of the commonly known ones such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Instead, the authors use Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework developed by Akiba et al. (2019). This framework uses complex optimization algorithms to automatically search the hyperparameter space for the best combination of hyperparameters that minimize the mean squared error.

Optimizing hyperparameters is crucial in improving the performance of any machine learning model, including those based on deep learning architectures. Hyperparameters are variables that determine the network structure and training process, such as learning rate, number of layers, batch size, etc. Unlike traditional parameters, they cannot be learned directly from the data through backpropagation but must be set manually before training begins.

Optuna simplifies this task by automating the search process using advanced optimization methods like Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) or Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). These methods iteratively sample new sets of hyperparameters, evaluate their performance, and update the sampling distribution until reaching optimal values.

However, it should be noted that although Optuna is primarily designed for hyperparameter tuning, it does not replace conventional optimization techniques like SGD or Adam during actual model training. Rather, once the optimal hyperparameters have been determined using Optuna, these can then be fed into the chosen deep learning architecture where standard optimization techniques will take over to adjust weights and biases within the neural networks.
