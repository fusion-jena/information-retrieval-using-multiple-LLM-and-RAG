The given context does not provide any explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects related to the application of deep learning techniques in remote sensing, such as model validation frameworks, limitations of deep learning models, and the need for robust and adaptive validation criteria. Additionally, it mentions the use of a standard machine learning hyperparameter search over two sites, considering factors like activation functions, optimizers, and learning rates. However, there is no mention of specific repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
