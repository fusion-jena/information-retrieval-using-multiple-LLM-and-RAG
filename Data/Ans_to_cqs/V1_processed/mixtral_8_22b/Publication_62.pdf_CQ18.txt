The information provided does not explicitly state the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one possible approach could have been employed. This might include tracking metrics such as accuracy, loss, or other relevant evaluation measures throughout the training process. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation or early stopping may also have been utilized to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding the monitoring strategy, this remains an assumption.
