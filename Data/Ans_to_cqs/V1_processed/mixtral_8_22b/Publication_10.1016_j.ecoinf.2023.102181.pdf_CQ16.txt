Based on the provided context, there isn't specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, generally speaking, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. These criteria help ensure that the model has learned enough from the training data but hasn't started to overfit.
