The given context does not provide explicit information about the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of machine learning ensembles and various algorithms like RandomForest, CART, MARS, etc. These techniques help improve model performance and reduce overfitting by combining multiple models or decision trees. While these methods may not directly correspond to traditional regularization techniques, they still contribute to preventing overfitting in the modeling process.
