Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. However, it does state that realistic augmentations of the original dataset were performed using generative methods. Generally, data augmentation techniques can include various image manipulations like flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and others. But without additional information, we cannot confirm which exact techniques were employed in this case.
