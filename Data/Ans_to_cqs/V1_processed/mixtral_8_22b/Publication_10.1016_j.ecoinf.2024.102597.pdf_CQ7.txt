The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as the ratio or method used for dividing the data into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions that a five-fold cross-validation was conducted, which suggests that the data might have been divided into five equal parts, where four parts were used for training and one part for testing in each iteration. This process was likely repeated five times, ensuring that every subset served once as the testing set. Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting and provides a more robust evaluation of the model's performance.
