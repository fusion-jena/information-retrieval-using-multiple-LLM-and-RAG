The text does not explicitly mention any specific evaluation metric for deep learning models such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it discusses the use of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value, which is derived from the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, to assess the performance of several machine learning models. The AUC value represents the degree or measure of separability between classes, indicating how well a model can distinguish between them. In this case, the AUC value was used to compare the performance of seven different machine learning models in predicting species distribution based on various environmental factors. The higher the AUC value, the better the model's ability to accurately classify the presence or absence of a particular species.
