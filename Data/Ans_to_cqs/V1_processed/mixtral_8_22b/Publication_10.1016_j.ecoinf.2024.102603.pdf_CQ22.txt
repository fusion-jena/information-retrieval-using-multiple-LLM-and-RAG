The given context does not provide information about the evaluation metrics used specifically for a deep learning model. However, it mentions the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a model, which includes the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE). These metrics are used in conjunction with the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation to assess the model's performance.
