The paper does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adjusting brightness or contrast. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, improving the performance and generalization ability of the deep learning models.

Unhelpful 
The paper discusses various aspects of the deep learning pipeline but does not explicitly mention the use of any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which data augmentation techniques were applied in this study.
