The authors use spatial block cross-validation to divide their dataset into training and validation sets. They first divide the region of interest into 5x5 geospatial blocks and assign these blocks to five folds, ensuring each fold has roughly the same number of presence observations. For each partition, the model is trained on 80% of the presences and validated on the remaining 20%. This process is repeated for each fold, and the results are averaged. The model with the highest mean Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) across all species is chosen. Target-group background points are employed as pseudo-absences to calculate the AUC on the validation set.
