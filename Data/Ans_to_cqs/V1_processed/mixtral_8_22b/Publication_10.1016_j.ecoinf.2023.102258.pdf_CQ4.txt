The given context does not provide specific details about the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that simple improvements over the baselines were achieved by applying data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation techniques generally refer to methods used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of the original dataset. Common examples include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise. These techniques help improve model generalization and prevent overfitting. Without explicit information, one cannot definitively state which specific data augmentation techniques were used in this case.
