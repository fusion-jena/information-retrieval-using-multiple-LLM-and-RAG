The performance of the deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is evaluated using the F1-score metric. The F1-score is calculated based on the precision and recall of the model's predictions. In this case, the CNN achieved a F1-score of 0.886 when evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation over the data. Other common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, and Area Under Curve (AUC). However, the text does not explicitly mention if any other metrics were used apart from the F1-score.
