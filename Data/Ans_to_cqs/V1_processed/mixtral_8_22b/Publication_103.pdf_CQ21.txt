The given context does not provide information about any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, based on general machine learning practices, some possible postprocessing steps could include evaluating the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix can help understand the misclassifications made by the model. Visualizing the results through techniques like saliency maps can also be useful to gain insights into how the model makes its decisions. But without explicit details mentioned in the context, these cannot be confirmed as the actual postprocessing steps followed in this case.
