The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about two publicly available datasets used in this research: the UrbanSound8K dataset and the Birdsdata dataset. These datasets are accessible via Kaggle, which is a platform for sharing and discovering open datasets. Therefore, it can be inferred that one method for obtaining raw data in this case was through utilizing these pre-existing public datasets.

Public datasets like those mentioned above often contain data collected from various sources, including sensors or surveys. For instance, audio datasets might involve recordings captured by microphones or other types of sensors. In the absence of explicit details regarding the collection process, it is safe to assume that the datasets were compiled using appropriate methods relevant to their respective domains.

To summarize, although the exact methods employed for gathering raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline remain unspecified, it is evident that the researchers made use of two openly accessible datasets—UrbanSound8K and Birdsdata—which likely encompass data gathered through suitable means pertinent to their fields.
