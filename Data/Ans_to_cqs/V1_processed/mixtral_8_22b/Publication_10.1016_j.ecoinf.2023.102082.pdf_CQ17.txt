The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for creating the high-resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the Earth (Lang10m) using Sentinel-2 optical images and a deep learning approach (convolutional neural networks). However, common regularization techniques used in deep learning include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, helping to prevent overfitting. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. These penalties discourage complex models, effectively preventing overfitting. Without explicit mentions in the given context, it cannot be confirmed if these or other regularization methods were employed in the creation of Lang10m.
