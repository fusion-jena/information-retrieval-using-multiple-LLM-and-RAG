The text does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions using Area Under Curve (AUC) as a measure of model quality, where a value closer to 1 indicates higher model quality. The authors also mention checking that all models reached at least a 0.75 AUC to ensure result reliability. While this is useful information, it does not directly address the query regarding other commonly used evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively state which specific evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the deep learning model apart from the mentioned AUC metric.
