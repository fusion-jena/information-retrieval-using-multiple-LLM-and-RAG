The text does not provide explicit information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, based on common practices in machine learning, one strategy to manage randomness is through setting specific seed values for various stages of the model development process. This includes initializing weights, shuffling datasets, and splitting data into training and validation sets. By fixing the seed value, researchers can reproduce their results and ensure consistency across experiments. Another strategy involves employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to estimate the variability introduced by randomness in the model performance. These methods help assess the robustness and generalizability of the models.
