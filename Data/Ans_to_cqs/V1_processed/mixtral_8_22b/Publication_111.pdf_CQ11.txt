The given information does not contain any specific details about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the research. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct answer to the query. However, considering that the research uses a dataset from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency, one might infer that the dataset could potentially be available through their official website or other related resources. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of a data repository link, it remains uncertain where the exact dataset was sourced from.
