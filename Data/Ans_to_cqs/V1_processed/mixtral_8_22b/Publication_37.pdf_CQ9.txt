Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the models were evaluated on a dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species but it does not specify where this dataset can be accessed or downloaded. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query based on the given context.
