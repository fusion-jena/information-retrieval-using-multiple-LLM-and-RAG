The deep learning pipeline primarily uses video data format. Specifically, the pipeline employs a subset of 330 videos that are shot with static cameras. Each frame from these videos has been manually annotated to indicate whether or not it contains an animal. The training and validation splits used to tune parameters and evaluate the system consist of 30 and 300 videos, respectively. However, it should be noted that camera-related parameters have not been annotated or used in testing the DynAIkonTrap. Instead, the focal length for all cameras was assumed to be the same as that of the RPi camera module. While other data formats like images, audio, or CSV might also be relevant for different applications, they do not appear to be explicitly mentioned or utilized within the given context regarding the deep learning pipeline.
