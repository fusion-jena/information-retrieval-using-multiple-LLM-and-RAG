The text does not provide explicit information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions manual labeling of events and the use of supervised machine learning algorithms, which often involve labeled datasets. Manual labeling can include various techniques like bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, etc., depending on the task requirements. In this case, since the focus is on detecting ungulate vocalizations, the annotations might have involved labeling audio clips with corresponding animal sounds. For visual tasks, common annotation techniques include bounding boxes around objects of interest, pixel-level instance segmentation, or even semantic segmentation where each pixel is assigned a class label. But without further details, we cannot definitively state which technique was employed here.
