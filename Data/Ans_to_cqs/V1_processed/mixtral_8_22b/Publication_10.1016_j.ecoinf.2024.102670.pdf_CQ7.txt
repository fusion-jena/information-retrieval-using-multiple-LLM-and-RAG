The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels. Typically, the data is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final model's performance. Common ratios for this division are 60%, 20%, and 20% for training, validation, and testing respectively, but these may vary depending on the application and available data.
