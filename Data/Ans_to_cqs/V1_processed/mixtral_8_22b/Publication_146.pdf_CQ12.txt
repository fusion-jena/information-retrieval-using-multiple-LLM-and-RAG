The text does not explicitly state what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the keywords and references that the model used is YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3), which is a real-time object detection system built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This is supported by the reference to the paper "[Ammar, A.; Koubaa, A.; Ahmed, M.; Saad, A. Aerial images processing for car detection using convolutional neural networks: Comparison between faster r-cnn and yolov3. arXiv 2019, arXiv:1910.07234.]" and the use of the keyword "object detection". Additionally, the mention of "hyperparameter setting... implemented the same hyperparameters as the Yolo model" also supports this conclusion. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN-based object detection model, specifically YOLOv3.
