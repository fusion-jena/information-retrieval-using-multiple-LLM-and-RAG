The sources of raw data collection in the deep learning pipeline can vary depending on the specific use case or problem being addressed. Some common methods include:

1. Surveys: Data collected through surveys, such as questionnaires or interviews, can be used to gather information about people's opinions, behaviors, or experiences. This type of data is often used in social sciences research, marketing studies, and customer feedback analysis.

2. Sensors: Sensors can collect various types of data, including temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, sound levels, and more. These sensors can be deployed in various environments, such as industrial settings, agricultural fields, or urban areas, to monitor conditions and detect anomalies.

3. Public Datasets: Many organizations and institutions provide publicly available datasets that researchers can use for their projects. For example, government agencies may release census data, weather records, or economic indicators. Similarly, academic institutions may publish datasets related to scientific experiments, medical trials, or linguistics research.

In the given context, it appears that some of the cited works have used public datasets, such as Bio-ORACLE, which provides global environmental data for marine species distribution modeling. Other works might have used sensor data, such as those measuring water quality parameters like nutrient concentrations or chlorophyll levels. However, without further details about each study's methodology, it is not possible to determine precisely what data collection methods they employed.
