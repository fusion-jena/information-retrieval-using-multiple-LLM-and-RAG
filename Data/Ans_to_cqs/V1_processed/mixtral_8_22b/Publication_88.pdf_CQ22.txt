The performance of the evaluated methods was expressed in terms of Overall Accuracy (OA), F1-Score, and Alarm Area (AA).

* Overall Accuracy (OA): is a global metric that indicates the percentage of samples correctly classified in relation to the total samples. It is defined by: OA = tp + tn / P + N Ã— 100 (2)

Therefore, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Overall Accuracy (OA), F1-Score, and Alarm Area (AA).
