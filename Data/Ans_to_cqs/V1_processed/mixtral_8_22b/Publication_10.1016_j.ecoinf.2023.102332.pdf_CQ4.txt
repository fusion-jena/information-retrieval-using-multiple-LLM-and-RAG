The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. The context primarily discusses natural language processing (NLP) methods used for investigating Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) from social media data. It mentions the use of Word2Vec, a popular word embedding technique, and the application of pre-trained models like the baroni word2vec model. Additionally, it refers to the potential benefits of employing emerging transformer-based models, such as BERT, for text classification tasks. However, there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques used within this context.
