The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including managing random seed values. However, it discusses a hybrid network called CA-Hybrid, which combines ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for improved feature extraction and object classification. This network incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) within its residual structure to enhance performance further. While this approach doesn't directly address randomness management, it demonstrates how integrating different techniques can improve model efficiency and effectiveness.
