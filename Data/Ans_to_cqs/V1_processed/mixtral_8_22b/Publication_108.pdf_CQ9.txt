Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be possible that the authors did not provide this information in the excerpts shared here. Therefore, I cannot determine if the data repository is available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find out the exact location of the data repository, it would be necessary to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors directly.
