Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was deployed after being trained for 350 epochs, achieving an accuracy of F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557. The model was trained using the Adam learning rate optimizer due to its effectiveness on smaller datasets. The training took place on a NVIDIA Quadro M4000 GPU with 8GB of memory, with a training time of 4.9 minutes per epoch. While specific details regarding the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection aren't mentioned, one could assume that standard practices were followed, including saving the trained model weights and architecture, and potentially deploying the model on a suitable platform for real-time object detection tasks.
