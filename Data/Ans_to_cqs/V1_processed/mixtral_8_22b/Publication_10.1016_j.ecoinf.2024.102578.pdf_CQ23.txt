The text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions that separate two-class models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal using the keras package in R. This suggests that the authors may have employed some form of stratified splitting or similar technique to create location-specific models. Additionally, preliminary trials showed that these region-specific models performed better, indicating that the models might be more accurate when applied to their respective regions. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether other techniques such as diverse datasets or cross-validation were utilized.
