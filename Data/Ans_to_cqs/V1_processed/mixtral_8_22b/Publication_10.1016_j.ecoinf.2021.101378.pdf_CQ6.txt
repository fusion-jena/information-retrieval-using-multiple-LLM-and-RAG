Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the dataset. It also includes handling outliers which might affect the model's accuracy.

2. Normalization or Standardization: Deep learning models often perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range. This is because these models use gradient-based optimization techniques where having features on different scales could slow down convergence. Common techniques include Min-Max Scaling, Decimal Scaling, and Z-Score Normalization.

3. Feature Selection: Not all features contribute equally to predicting the target variable. Some features might even add noise and reduce the modelâ€™s performance. Therefore, selecting relevant features is crucial. Techniques such as correlation matrix with heatmap, mutual information gain, backward elimination, etc., can be used for feature selection.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Deep learning models cannot directly handle categorical variables. They need to be converted into numerical format. Label encoding and one-hot encoding are common ways to do this.

5. Train-Test Split: The dataset should ideally be split into two parts - one for training the model and another for testing its performance. This helps prevent overfitting and provides a more accurate measure of how well the model will generalize to unseen data.

However, please note that not all these steps are always necessary and they depend largely on the specific problem and dataset being considered.
