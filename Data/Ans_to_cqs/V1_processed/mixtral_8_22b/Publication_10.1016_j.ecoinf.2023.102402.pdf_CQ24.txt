The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common strategies to address randomness include fixing the random seed value before training the model, which ensures reproducibility of results. Another approach is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results to reduce variability caused by random initialization. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation can help evaluate the performance of the model on different subsets of the dataset, reducing the impact of randomness due to data splitting.
