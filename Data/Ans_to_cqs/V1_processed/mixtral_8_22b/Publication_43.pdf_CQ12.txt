The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its deep learning model. Specifically, it employs two types of CNN architectures - ResNet and GoogLeNet. These models are known for their high accuracy and depth, with ResNet having 152 layers and 25.5 million parameters, while GoogLeNet is based on inception v3 and has 23.2 million parameters and 22 layers with learnable weights. Both models were winners of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) in their respective years.
