The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it is stated that the authors have provided supplementary materials which include notebooks used to define and train the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. These notebooks are available for download as.nb files (Mathematica notebooks) or.pdf files (annotated versions). Unfortunately, there is no mention of a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where this data has been uploaded. Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot determine the exact location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
