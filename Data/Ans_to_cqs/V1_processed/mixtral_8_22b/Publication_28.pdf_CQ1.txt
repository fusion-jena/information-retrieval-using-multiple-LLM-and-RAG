The given context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that satellite images are being used as input data for various machine learning and deep learning models. These satellite images could have been collected through satellites equipped with imaging devices such as cameras or other types of sensors. Additionally, some studies mentioned in the context use publicly available datasets like RESFlow and RS-DCNN for their research. It should also be noted that the context mentions the use of Apache Spark architecture for executing a pixel-based CNN module, which suggests that the authors might have used existing datasets rather than collecting raw data themselves. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the data collection methods in the provided context, it cannot be confirmed how exactly the raw data was gathered.
