Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, we do know some details about the parameters used in the DETR model, specifically the object queries parameter being set to 100, which allows for the detection of up to 100 turtles in an image. Additionally, the color channels of the images were normalized using the means and standard deviations from the ImageNet dataset.
