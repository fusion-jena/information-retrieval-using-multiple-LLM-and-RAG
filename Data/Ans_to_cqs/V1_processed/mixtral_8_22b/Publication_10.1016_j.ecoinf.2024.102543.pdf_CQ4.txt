In the given context, one data augmentation technique has been mentioned - random saturation adjustments. This technique involves adjusting the intensity of colors in each training example, which increases the number of outputs per example to two. However, other common data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling have not been explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, based on the information available, only random saturation adjustments can be confirmed as a data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline.
