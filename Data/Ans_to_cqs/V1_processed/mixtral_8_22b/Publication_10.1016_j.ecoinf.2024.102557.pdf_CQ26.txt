The papers cited do not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they provide insights into various aspects of applying machine learning and deep learning in ecology and biodiversity research. Some general approaches to handling data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or features within each set. Oversampling is a technique where samples from minority classes are duplicated to balance the class distribution, while undersampling removes samples from majority classes to achieve the same goal. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from multiple sources or environments to reduce bias caused by limited sampling locations or conditions.

While these techniques can help mitigate data bias, it is essential to consider domain-specific factors when selecting appropriate strategies. For instance, in ecological studies, spatial autocorrelation and temporal dependencies might require specialized preprocessing techniques to ensure unbiased model performance. Additionally, careful consideration should be given to ethical implications, such as ensuring fair representation of all relevant species or ecosystems.
