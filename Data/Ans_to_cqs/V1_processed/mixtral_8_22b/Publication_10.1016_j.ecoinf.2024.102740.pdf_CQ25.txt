The purpose of the machine learning (not specifically deep learning) model in this context is for classification. The authors use Random Forest (RF) algorithm, a supervised machine learning method, to generate accurate, dynamic information on grassland. This information includes aboveground biomass and nutritive characteristics, which are crucial for sustainable ecosystem management and conservation. The model is trained using ground data points and validated using out-of-bag samples. The goal is to create an unbiased internal estimate of the generalization error. The optimal parameters for the RF model are determined through testing different values for the maximum shaft number and the minimum sample number. The final model is then used to classify grassland species into two main clusters, enabling sustainable grassland management.
