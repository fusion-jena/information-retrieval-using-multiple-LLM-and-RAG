Techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly employed to mitigate data bias during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets, ensuring each subset maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. This technique helps prevent any single class from being underrepresented or overrepresented in the training, validation, or test sets.

Oversampling and undersampling are methods used to balance datasets containing unequal numbers of samples across various classes. In oversampling, additional copies of minority class examples are created to match the quantity of majority class instances. Conversely, undersampling reduces the number of majority class examples to equalize the sample sizes between classes. Both strategies aim to create a balanced dataset, thereby improving model performance and reducing bias towards the dominant class.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide variety of data points representing multiple scenarios, conditions, and variations. By incorporating diverse data sources, models become better equipped to handle real-world complexities and minimize biases stemming from narrowly focused datasets.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing involves employing techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These methods help ensure fair representation of all classes, promote balanced datasets, and improve overall model performance.
