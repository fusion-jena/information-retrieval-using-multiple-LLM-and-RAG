Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study focuses on using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for estimating species distributions based on bioclimatic variables. The authors claim that their approach is novel compared to other studies which use Deep Learning Models (DLMs) and apply techniques like tSNE (another DRM) to visualize input data and results from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for modeling species distribution at a fine resolution. In this case, the datasets used would likely be related to bioclimatic variables and species location data rather than traditional computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
