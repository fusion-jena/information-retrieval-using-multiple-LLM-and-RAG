The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on class labels, ensuring each subset has approximately the same percentage of samples from each target class. This technique helps maintain the original distribution of classes when creating training and testing sets.

Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by replicating existing examples or generating synthetic ones. This method aims to balance the dataset and reduce the impact of imbalance on model performance.

Undersampling reduces the size of the majority class by randomly removing instances until achieving a balanced dataset. While this approach may lead to loss of potentially useful information, it can be beneficial when dealing with large datasets where the minority class is severely underrepresented.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering a wide range of data points representing various aspects of the problem domain. By incorporating diverse perspectives, this technique attempts to minimize biases introduced by overreliance on certain types of data or sources.

These techniques help mitigate data bias during preprocessing stages of the deep learning pipeline but should be chosen carefully depending on the nature and characteristics of the available dataset.
