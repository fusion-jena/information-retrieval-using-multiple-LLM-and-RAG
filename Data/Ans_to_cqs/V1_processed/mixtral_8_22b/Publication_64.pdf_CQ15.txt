The authors use Adam as the learning rule for optimizing their deep learning model. They mention that they trained the model for 100 epochs on a GTX 1080 GPU for six days. Additionally, they employ standard data augmentation techniques such as shearing, translating, and mirroring to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. However, they avoid rotating or flipping images labeled as 'habitat,' as it does not make sense to have trees or landscapes upside down. Furthermore, after applying transformations, they resize the images to fit the ResNet standard input size of 224x224 pixels.
