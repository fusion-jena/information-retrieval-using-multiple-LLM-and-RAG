The text does not provide information about any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, etc., are commonly used to increase the amount of training data available and improve the model's ability to generalize. However, without explicit mention or description of these techniques being employed in this study, I cannot confirm their usage.
