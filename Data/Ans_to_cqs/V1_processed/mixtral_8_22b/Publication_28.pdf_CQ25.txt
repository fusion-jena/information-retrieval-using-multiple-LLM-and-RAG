The purpose of the deep learning model presented in this paper is for satellite imagery analysis on ecology management, specifically for examining satellite images using a deep learning model for ecological condition monitoring. The model used is called the Parameter Tuned Deep Learning based EfficientNet model with Variational Autoencoder (PTDLEN-VAE). This model aims to assign proper class labels to satellite images during the classification process. It utilizes an autoencoder (AE) network, which is a type of neural network trained to reproduce the input as the output. The AE has a hidden layer that defines a code used for input representation. The network consists of an encoder function and a decoder function, where the input data is denoted as 'x'. The meaningful features from the AE are captured by constraining the code 'z' to have lower dimensions compared to 'x', resulting in an undercomplete representation. The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a directed network that uses learned approximate inferences and is trained using gradient approaches. The PTDLEN-VAE model includes several operations such as pre-processing, EfficientNet-based feature extraction, IKHO-based parameter optimization, and VAE-based classification. The ultimate goal of this model is to monitor ecological conditions through satellite image analysis.
