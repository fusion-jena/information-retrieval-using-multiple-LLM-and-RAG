Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context mentions various platforms like AWS Kinesis and Apache Kibana, but these are related to event-stream processing rather than deployment of deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the information given.
