The information provided does not explicitly state the specific format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input data consists of 40-dimensional data, which suggests that the data could be in a structured format such as a CSV file or a similar tabular format. Additionally, the fact that the data undergoes batch normalization indicates that the data might be numerical in nature. It also states that the data contains various features like LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance-based variables, which implies that the data is likely geospatial in nature. Unfortunately, without more explicit details about the exact format of the input data, we cannot definitively confirm if it is in a specific format such as image, audio, video, or CSV.
