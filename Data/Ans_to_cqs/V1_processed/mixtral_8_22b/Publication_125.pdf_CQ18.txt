From the provided information, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves dividing the dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The training set consists of 22,666 images used to train the model. The validation set contains 7554 images utilized to validate the trained model, which likely means evaluating its performance after each epoch or iteration during training. Lastly, the testing set also includes 7554 images employed to assess the final performance of the model once the training process has been completed. By employing separate sets for training, validation, and testing, the researchers can effectively track the progress of their model throughout the training phase while minimizing the risk of overfitting.
