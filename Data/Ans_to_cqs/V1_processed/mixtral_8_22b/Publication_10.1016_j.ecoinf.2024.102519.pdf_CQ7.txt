Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, or validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the authors might follow common practices in machine learning where the dataset is typically divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation datasets.

A typical approach could involve splitting the dataset into 60-70% for training, 20-30% for testing, and 10-20% for validation. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training while using the remaining portions to evaluate its performance and prevent overfitting.

Since the context does not provide any specific details regarding the criteria used for splitting the data, one cannot definitively state how the authors approached this aspect of their work. It would be best to refer directly to the paper or contact the authors for more precise information.
