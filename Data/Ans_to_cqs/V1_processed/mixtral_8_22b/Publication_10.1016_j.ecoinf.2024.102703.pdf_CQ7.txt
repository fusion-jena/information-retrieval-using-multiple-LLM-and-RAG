The text mentions that 64 water samples were used for model calibration, which can be interpreted as the training set. The remaining samples were used for validation. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific criteria or methodology used to split the dataset into these subsets. Typically, datasets are randomly divided into training, testing, and validation sets based on predefined ratios such as 70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively. It is essential to ensure that the distribution of classes or features remains consistent across all subsets to prevent biased results.

In this case, since no explicit splitting criterion is mentioned, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact method used to divide the dataset. Nonetheless, it is safe to assume that some form of random sampling or stratified sampling might have been employed to maintain consistency across the subsets.
