The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific format of the data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset used in the research is obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency, which suggests that the data might be related to marine or oceanographic measurements such as sea surface temperature (SST) and significant wave height (SWH). Given that the task involves time series prediction, it is likely that the data is in a numerical tabular format, possibly in CSV or similar format. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data format, one cannot definitively state what type of data format is being used in the deep learning pipeline.
