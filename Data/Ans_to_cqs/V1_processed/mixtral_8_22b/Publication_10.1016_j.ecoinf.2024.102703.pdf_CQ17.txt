The text does not provide explicit information about the use of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) model for variable selection and statistical regularization to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. LASSO is a type of regularization method that adds a penalty term to the loss function during optimization, which helps reduce overfitting by constraining the weights of the connections between nodes in the neural network. Although not explicitly mentioned, other common regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization could have been employed alongside LASSO to further mitigate overfitting.
