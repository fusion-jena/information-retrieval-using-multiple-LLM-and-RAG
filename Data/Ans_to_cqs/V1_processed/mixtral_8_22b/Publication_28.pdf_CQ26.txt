The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it discusses the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in deep learning models for satellite image classification. In VAEs, the initial sample is drawn from the code distribution pmodel(z) and executed through a differentiable generator network g(z). Then, x undergoes sampling from a distribution Pmodel(x; g(z)) = pmodel(x| z). During the training process, an estimated inference network (or encoder) q(z| x) is employed for obtaining z, and Pmodel(x| z) is considered as the decoder network. The main perception of VAE is that it can be trained using the maximization of the variational lower bound L(q) related to the data point x.
