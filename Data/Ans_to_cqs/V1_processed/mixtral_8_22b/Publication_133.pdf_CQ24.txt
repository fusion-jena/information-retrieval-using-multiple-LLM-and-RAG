In order to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One such strategy is the use of a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the results obtained from different runs of the same experiment are reproducible. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs of the experiment with different random seeds and then average the results. This helps to reduce the variability caused by randomness. Additionally, cross-validation can be used to evaluate the performance of the model across different subsets of the data. This helps to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular subset of the data. Finally, regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model. These techniques introduce randomness into the training process, which can help to improve the robustness of the model.
