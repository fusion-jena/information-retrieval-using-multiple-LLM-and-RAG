Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors might have used publicly available datasets or collected their own dataset through surveys or sensors. Specifically, they mention adapting the vgg16 network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which suggests that they could have used ImageNet as one of their sources for raw data collection. Additionally, they discuss applying various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes, indicating that they had access to a substantial amount of raw data to work with. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what specific methods were employed for gathering the raw data.
