Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses outlier detection and artificial data replacement processes for data pre-processing. However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed to address data bias during this stage. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, it cannot be determined which techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
