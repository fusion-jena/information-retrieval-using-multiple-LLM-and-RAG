The text does not explicitly mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, there are some implicit clues about how the authors might have approached this issue. For instance, they discuss using larger batch sizes, which can help reduce the impact of random initialization and improve model stability. They also emphasize the importance of choosing appropriate patch sizes to balance capturing sufficient context without overwhelming the central information. Additionally, their use of ensembles suggests a strategy to mitigate the effects of randomness by combining multiple models. Nonetheless, these observations are speculative, and the document does not directly address the management of random seeds or other sources of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
