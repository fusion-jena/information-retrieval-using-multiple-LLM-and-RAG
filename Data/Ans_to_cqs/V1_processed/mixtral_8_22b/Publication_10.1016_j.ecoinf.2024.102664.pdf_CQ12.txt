Three types of deep learning models were used in the pipeline: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model.

The CNN model consists of an image input layer, a convolutional layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2 × 25, a max pooling layer with a kernel size of 2 × 2, and two fully connected layers followed by a regression output layer.

The LSTM model comprises a sequence input layer, an LSTM layer with 60 nodes, two fully connected layers, and a regression output layer. Both the CNN and LSTM models have the same number of nodes in their respective fully connected layers, i.e., 10 and 1.

Lastly, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model combines the strengths of both CNN and LSTM networks. This model was found to consistently achieve the highest R2 values across all regions compared to the standalone CNN and LSTM models.
