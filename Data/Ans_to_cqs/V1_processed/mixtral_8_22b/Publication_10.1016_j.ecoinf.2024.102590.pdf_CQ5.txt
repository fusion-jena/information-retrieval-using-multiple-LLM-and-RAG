Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions the use of aerial images of Kruger National Park (KNP) taken about every two years for mapping land cover or more specifically woody cover using deep learning methods. Additionally, the context discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for processing satellite imagery and performing supervised learning workflows. It also describes the use of Random Forest classifiers along with GLCM texture metrics for image classification. But unfortunately, there is no explicit information regarding the use of standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline.
