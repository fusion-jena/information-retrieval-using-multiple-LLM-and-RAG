The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that images are initially taken with the help of an underwater drone and then segmented into smaller patches. This suggests that some form of image segmentation might be employed during the data preparation stage. Additionally, the text discusses the use of various handcrafted descriptors and D-CNN models for feature extraction, indicating that labeled data was likely utilized for model training. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of the data annotation techniques used, we cannot definitively state what methods were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
