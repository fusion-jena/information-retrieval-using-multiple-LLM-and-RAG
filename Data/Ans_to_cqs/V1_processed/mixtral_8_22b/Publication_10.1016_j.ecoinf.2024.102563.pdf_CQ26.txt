The given context does not directly discuss specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some related concepts can be found within the references mentioned. For instance, stratified sampling is discussed by Breiman (2001) in relation to random forest models, which could potentially help mitigate class imbalance issues. Additionally, Carr√® et al. (2007) mention database extension for digital soil mapping using artificial neural networks, suggesting possible use of synthetic data generation or augmentation techniques to tackle data bias. Although these sources do not explicitly explain how to handle data bias, they provide insights into potential strategies such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
