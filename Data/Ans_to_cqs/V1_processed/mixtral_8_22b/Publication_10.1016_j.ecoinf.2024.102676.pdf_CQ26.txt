The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions several approaches related to handling missing values and improving the overall dataset quality.

The authors discuss two main types of procedures used in their experiments: intuitive and machine-learning-based. Intuitive methods include omitting missing values and mean imputation. Machine-learning-based methods involve using tree-based nonparametric imputation methods like missForest, missRanger, or MICE RF. They also suggest collecting imperfect footprints when high-quality ones are insufficient and advocating for using missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline.

While these techniques do not directly address data bias, they contribute to enhancing the overall quality of the dataset, which can indirectly help mitigate biases. For instance, removing data rows containing missing values could potentially reduce noise and improve the reliability of the dataset. Similarly, employing advanced imputation methods like missForest can lead to more accurate predictions and better representation of the underlying patterns within the data.

However, without explicit mention of techniques specifically targeting data bias, such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, one cannot definitively state what methods are employed to tackle data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline based solely on the given context.
