The text does not explicitly mention the format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data format used is images. The passage discusses the use of deep learning models for image classification tasks, specifically focusing on classifying shrubs in images. It mentions the comparison of various deep learning architectures such as ResNet, ViT, Swin, and ConvNeXt for image classification purposes. Additionally, the discussion revolves around the ImageNet dataset, which consists of annotated images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images.
