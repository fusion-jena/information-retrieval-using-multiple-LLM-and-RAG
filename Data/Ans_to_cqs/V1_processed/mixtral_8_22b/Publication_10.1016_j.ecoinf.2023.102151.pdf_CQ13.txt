The sources provided do not contain information about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning models for classification purposes in digital soil mapping. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hyperparameters were used in those studies. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer type (such as Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent), regularization techniques (such as dropout, weight decay), and activation functions (such as ReLU, sigmoid). These hyperparameters can greatly affect the performance of the model and need to be carefully tuned during training.
