Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of generalizing patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Regularization helps improve the model's ability to generalize by adding constraints during the optimization process.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a thinned version of the original network. This prevents complex co-adaptations between neurons and encourages each neuron to learn independently useful information. During prediction time, all neurons are used but scaled down proportionally to the dropout rate.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squares of weights. By penalizing large weights, this method discourages the model from relying too heavily on any single input feature, promoting more distributed representations and reducing overfitting. The strength of the penalty is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, which uses the absolute value of weights instead of squaring them, and early stopping, where training is halted once validation error stops improving. These methods can be combined or applied individually depending on the specific requirements of the task and dataset.
