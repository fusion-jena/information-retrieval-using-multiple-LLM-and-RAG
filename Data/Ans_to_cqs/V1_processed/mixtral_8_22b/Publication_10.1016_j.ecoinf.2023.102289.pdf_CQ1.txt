Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference various sources such as Microsoft COCO (Common Objects in Context) and the Places Database, which suggests that publicly available datasets could potentially be used as input for the deep learning process. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Google Street View images, indicating that web scraping or similar techniques might also be employed. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods are being used for gathering raw data.
