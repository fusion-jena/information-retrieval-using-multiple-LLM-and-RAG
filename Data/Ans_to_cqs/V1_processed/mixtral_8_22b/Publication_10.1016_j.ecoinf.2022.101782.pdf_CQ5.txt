The context does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input tensors are normalized to ImageNet mean values, suggesting that the ImageNet dataset might have been used during the development or fine-tuning process of the deep learning model. Additionally, the mention of preprocessing steps such as horizontal flips, shearing, random zooms, and scaling pixel values to the range of [0, 1] indicates that the dataset likely consists of images. Unfortunately, without additional context, I cannot confirm if any other datasets like MNIST or CIFAR were also utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
