The given context does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and AdaGrad. These techniques help minimize the loss function during training, enabling the model to learn effectively from the data. The choice of optimization technique depends on factors such as convergence speed, memory requirements, and computational efficiency.

Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the study focuses on analyzing the relationship between valve gape and pumping rate in marine organisms using empirical laboratory experiments and mechanistic models. The authors suggest that having big-data on valve gaping could improve predictions on productivity and aid in aquaculture decision-making. However, there is no mention of any deep learning or machine learning techniques being employed in this research. Therefore, it cannot be determined which optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline based solely on the provided context.
