The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that the input data might be images or satellite imagery since the paper discusses deforestation detection from remote sensing data. Furthermore, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly employed for processing grid-like topology data such as images, also suggests that the input data could be in image format. Nevertheless, without more detailed information regarding the dataset or preprocessing steps, we cannot definitively state the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline.
