To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, which included various types of ungulate species such as wild goat, Urial, and Jebeer Gazelle. The dataset consisted of different features like Area of Core Habitats (km^2), Length of Roads Intersecting Core Habitats (km), and Percentage of Protected Core Habitats (%). Secondly, the ensemble prediction was generated using a weighted-averaging approach, where individual models were assigned weights based on their predictive accuracy on the test data. Lastly, evaluation and comparative analyses were performed for both individual models and the ensemble model through two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). These measures helped assess the model's performance comprehensively and ensured reliable predictions of species distribution across the central Iranian plateau.
