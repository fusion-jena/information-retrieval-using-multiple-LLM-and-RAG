The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for modeling purposes. These methods do not directly involve data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which are typically associated with image or video data. Instead, they focus on processing structured numerical data. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the exact data annotation techniques used in this case.
