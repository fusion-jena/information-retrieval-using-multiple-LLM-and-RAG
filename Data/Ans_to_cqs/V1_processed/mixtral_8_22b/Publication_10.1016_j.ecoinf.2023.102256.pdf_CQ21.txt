The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, it does provide some information about the overall process of training and testing the models.

From the given context, we understand that the model was trained on a relatively small number of examples, possibly due to limited availability of ecological datasets. The architecture used for the bird classification task yielded good results, leading to its adoption for further use. It also mentions that the network must be retrained every time new data or species are added.

In general, common postprocessing steps after model training may include evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, etc. Additionally, creating visualizations like confusion matrices, saliency maps, or gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) can help better understand the model's decision-making process. These techniques aid in identifying areas where the model performs well and where improvements might be needed.

However, since these details are not mentioned specifically in the provided context, I cannot confirm the exact postprocessing steps followed in this particular scenario.
