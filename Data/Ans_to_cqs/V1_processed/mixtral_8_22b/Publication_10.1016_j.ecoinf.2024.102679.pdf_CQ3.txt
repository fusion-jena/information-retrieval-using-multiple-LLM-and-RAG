The text does not provide explicit details about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the process involves both the use of a deep learning model and human manual interpretation steps. This suggests that some form of data annotation was likely performed during the development or training phase of the deep learning model. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Without more specific information, it cannot be definitively stated which of these techniques were utilized in this particular case.
