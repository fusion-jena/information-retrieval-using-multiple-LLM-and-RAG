Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the location of the data repository. However, it is common practice to publish datasets related to research studies on platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. To find out the exact location of the data repository, please refer to the original source of the text snippets or contact the authors directly.
