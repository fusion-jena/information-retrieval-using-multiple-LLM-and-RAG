Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study. However, some common practices to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation techniques, stratified sampling methods, or data augmentation strategies. These approaches help prevent overfitting and increase the robustness of the model when applied to unseen data. Without further information about the methodology used in the study, we cannot provide a more detailed response regarding the specific steps taken to enhance the generalizability of their deep learning model.
