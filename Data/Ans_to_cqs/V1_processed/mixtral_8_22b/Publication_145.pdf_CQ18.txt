To monitor the model performance during training, a combination of binary cross-entropy and Dice coefficient-related loss was employed. This approach allowed for the evaluation of the accuracy of the predicted masks generated by the model. Additionally, the optimization algorithm RMSprop was utilized with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. Training was conducted over 300 epochs with batches of 24 images each time. These strategies were implemented to ensure optimal performance and convergence of the model during the training process.
