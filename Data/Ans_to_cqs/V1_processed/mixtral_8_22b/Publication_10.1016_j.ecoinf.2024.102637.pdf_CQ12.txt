In the given context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the AlexNet architecture. The authors mention using AlexNet as the backbone model for their proposed lightweight SIAlex model. They aim to explore the potential of shallow and simple models without complex connection techniques or attention mechanisms. Additionally, they discuss other CNN architectures like VGG-16 and ResNet, further emphasizing the use of CNNs in their work.
