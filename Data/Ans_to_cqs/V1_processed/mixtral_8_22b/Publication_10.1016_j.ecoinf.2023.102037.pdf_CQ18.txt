The authors employed a specific strategy to validate their model's performance in a practical manner. They divided their data based on the sticky plate level, ensuring that all insects from the same sticky plate image remained within the same dataset (i.e., training, validation, or testing). By doing so, they could assess the model's ability to predict a class for any identified object on previously unseen sticky plate imagesâ€”data not included in the training phase. This methodology aimed to mimic how the model would function in real-world applications. Furthermore, the authors highlighted the importance of using robust validation methods instead of simpler ones, such as randomly dividing the data, which may lead to inflated estimates of model performance.
