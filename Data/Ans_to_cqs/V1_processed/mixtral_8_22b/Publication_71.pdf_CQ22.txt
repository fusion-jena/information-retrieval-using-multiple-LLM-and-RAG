The text does not provide explicit information about the specific performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the average overall accuracy for the CNN model reached 0.8298. Therefore, one metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of instances evaluated. It is calculated as the ratio of true positive and true negative predictions to the total number of cases. Other common evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the classifier. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives in the data set. F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single measure, while AUC represents the degree or measure of separability between classes. These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the deep learning model in accurately predicting outcomes based on input features.
