The text does not explicitly mention the specific optimization technique used for finding the best hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. However, it does provide some clues about the approach taken. Initially, a small dimensional space of hyperparameters was defined and explored using the original variables. This suggests that some form of parameter sweep or search was employed. Furthermore, the text mentions that one of the hyperparameters was modified iteratively following the direction that improved performance. This indicates that the optimization process might have involved iterative refinement based on the results obtained from previous trials. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the exact optimization technique used, it can only be inferred that some form of systematic search or tuning strategy was applied to identify the most suitable hyperparameters for the given task.
