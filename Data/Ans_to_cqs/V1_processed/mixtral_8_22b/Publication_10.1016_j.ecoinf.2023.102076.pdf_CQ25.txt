The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is text classification. Specifically, the authors used a pretrained BERT model for classifying web articles based on their relevance to certain topics related to bats and exploitation. Due to the limitation of BERT accepting a maximum of 512 tokens as input, they employed a method of splitting longer web articles into smaller subsections and retaining those containing relevant keywords. This approach has been previously applied to long document classification tasks. The goal of applying this deep learning model is to accurately categorize web articles according to specific themes, which could aid in various applications such as information retrieval, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.
