The paper referenced in the given context does not explicitly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class proportions in both sets. This ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the number of instances in each class to balance the dataset. Oversampling increases the number of minority class examples by duplicating them or creating synthetic examples using methods such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling decreases the number of majority class examples by removing random instances or selecting only those that contribute most to the classification task.

Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of representative examples from different sources, environments, and conditions to ensure that the model can accurately recognize various patterns and avoid biased predictions based on limited data.

These techniques help mitigate data bias and improve the performance of deep learning models. It is essential to consider these approaches during preprocessing to build robust and reliable models.
