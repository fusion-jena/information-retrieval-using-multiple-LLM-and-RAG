Unfortunately, none of the given sources provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The papers cited discuss various aspects of optimizing off-chip memory accesses for deep learning accelerators, improving YOLOv5s for fish passage monitoring, developing an efficient object detection network for densely spaced fish and small targets, creating a multiple fish tracking system based on Counterpoised JointNet, and training memory access optimization for Convolutional Neural Networks. However, they do not mention any specific code repositories or links to their respective implementations. To find out where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available, it would be necessary to consult additional sources or contact the authors directly.
