The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model using the crawling tool mentioned. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, some common preprocessing steps can be discussed. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent entries in the dataset. In our case, it could mean ensuring the quality of the retrieved NetCDF files containing vital parameters like reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations.

2. Feature Scaling/Normalization: Deep learning models often perform better when numerical input features are scaled or normalized. Techniques such as Min-Max scaling or Standardization can be used to bring all features to a comparable range.

3. Encoding Categorical Variables: If there are any categorical variables present in the dataset, they need to be converted into numerical form. Techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding can be employed.

4. Outlier Detection & Handling: Identifying and dealing with outliers in the dataset is crucial to prevent them from skewing the results. Common techniques involve setting threshold limits or using statistical methods to detect anomalies.

5. Train-Test Split: Before training the deep learning model, the dataset should ideally be split into two parts - training data and testing data. This helps evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data.

6. Cross-Validation: To ensure robustness and avoid overfitting, cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can be applied during the training phase.
