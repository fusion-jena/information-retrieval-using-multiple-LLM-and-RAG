The given context does not provide explicit information about any postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation was performed based on the mention of a validation set and a test set. In addition, the context mentions that the training process converged before the last epoch due to an early stopping strategy, indicating that some sort of metric monitoring was taking place during training. It also states that all tests were run on a specific system configuration, suggesting that there might have been some benchmarking or testing procedures carried out after the model training. Nevertheless, without more concrete details regarding these aspects, it cannot be definitively stated what specific postprocessing steps were involved after the model training.
