The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a three-phase grid search. Grid search is a technique used in machine learning to tune the parameters of a model by trying all possible combinations of parameter values from a given set. This methodical approach ensures that the optimal combination of hyperparameters is found, resulting in improved model performance. In this case, the grid search was employed to find the best regression technique for each step of the process, ultimately leading to the selection of specific models like Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and others mentioned in Table 8.
