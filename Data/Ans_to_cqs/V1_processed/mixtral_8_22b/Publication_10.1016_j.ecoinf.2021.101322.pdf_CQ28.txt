Based on the given information, it appears that the implementation and training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were done using Python programming language along with the use of Keras and TensorFlow libraries. Furthermore, computations were carried out utilizing CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards having 12GB of GPU memory. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being utilized for deployment of the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
