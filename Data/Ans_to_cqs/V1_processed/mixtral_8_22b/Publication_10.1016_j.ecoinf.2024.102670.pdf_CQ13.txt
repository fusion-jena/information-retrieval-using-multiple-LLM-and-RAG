The given context does not provide explicit details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that Guo et al. (2021) used a deep learning-based model to classify points of interest in 3D volumetric images. Additionally, it discusses how certain parameters like binarization thresholds τ1 and τ2 in Vidal-Diez de Ulzurrun et al. (2019) and the parameter κ in Wang et al. (2019) need to be tuned. It also states that in contrast, the proposed technique requires tuning parameters related to the scale of the objects of interest, making the process more intuitive. Unfortunately, without further information, I cannot specify the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning models discussed in the context.
