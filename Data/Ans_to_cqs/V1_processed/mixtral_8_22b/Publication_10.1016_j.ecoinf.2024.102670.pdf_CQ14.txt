The paper does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether they used methods like grid search or random search for optimization.

Based on the given information, I am unable to determine the method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the model. It would require additional details from the authors or further research into their work to find out more about this aspect.
