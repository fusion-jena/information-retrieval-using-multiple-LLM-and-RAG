The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that all Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained using the TensorFlow backend on a Tesla M100 graphics processing unit (GPU). This suggests that the TensorFlow framework might have been used for model serialization and deployment. The use of GPU indicates that the platform chosen for deployment has hardware acceleration capabilities. Unfortunately, without more specific details, I cannot provide a definitive answer on the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
