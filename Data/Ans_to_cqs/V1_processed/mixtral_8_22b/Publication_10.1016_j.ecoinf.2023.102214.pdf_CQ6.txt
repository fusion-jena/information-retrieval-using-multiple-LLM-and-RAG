Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. However, some general practices can be inferred from the text. For instance, the authors mention using data augmentation techniques like left-right mirroring to reduce overfitting and improve the algorithm's ability to match individuals based on pelt patterns. This implies that image manipulation could be part of their preprocessing routine. Additionally, they discuss collecting and contributing large, fully labeled datasets for deep learning research, suggesting that labeling and organizing data would likely precede training. Nevertheless, without direct evidence from the passage, one cannot definitively state what exact preprocessing steps are taken before training the deep learning model.
