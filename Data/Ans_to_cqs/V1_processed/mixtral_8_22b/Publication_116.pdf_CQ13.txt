The information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the available information. It would require additional details about the implementation of the deep learning model to accurately determine its hyperparameters.
