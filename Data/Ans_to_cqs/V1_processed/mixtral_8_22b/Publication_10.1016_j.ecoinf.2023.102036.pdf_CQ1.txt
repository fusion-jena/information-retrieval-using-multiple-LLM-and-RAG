The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, it can be inferred that the use of 'big data', 'labelled images', and 'existing deep learning techniques' suggests that the authors may have employed publicly available datasets or collected their own data using various means like cameras or sensors. Additionally, the reference to 'a small amount of K labelled images in each category' implies that some form of manual labeling or annotation was involved in preparing the dataset. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the data collection process, one cannot definitively state the exact methods used for gathering raw data in this case.
