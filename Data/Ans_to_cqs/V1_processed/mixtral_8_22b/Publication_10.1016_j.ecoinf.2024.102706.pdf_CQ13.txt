The given context does not provide any details about a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Instead, it discusses various machine learning models like Multiple Linear Regression, Elastic Net (Enet), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and LightGBM. Each of these models has specific hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance.

For instance, Enet uses alpha (Î±) and l1\_ratio as hyperparameters. SVM employs Cost (C), gamma, Kernel, and epsilon. RF uses n\_estimators, max\_features, max\_depth, min\_samples\_split, and min\_samples\_leaf. XGBoost and LightGBM have similar hyperparameters like n\_estimators, max\_depth, colsample\_bytree, min\_child\_weight, subsample, learning\_rate, num\_leaves, feature\_fraction, bagging\_fraction, and bagging\_freq.

These hyperparameters control different aspects of each model, such as regularization strength, kernel type, number of trees, maximum depth of trees, etc. They play a significant role in determining the overall performance and accuracy of the models.

However, since no deep learning model is discussed in the provided context, I cannot provide the required information regarding the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
