The given context primarily discusses large-scale image datasets and their use in training deep learning models like the BEiT model. Specifically, it mentions the use of the ImageNet dataset for obtaining pretraining weights. Additionally, the context refers to various techniques applied to images, such as Gaussian Noise, Speckle Noise, ToTensor, Normalization, and several augmentations like rotation, brightness adjustment, contrast change, saturation alteration, and hue modification. These details suggest that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files.
