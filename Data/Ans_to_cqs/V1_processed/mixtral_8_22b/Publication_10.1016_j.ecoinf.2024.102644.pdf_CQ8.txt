The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it is stated that all data and scripts are continuously updated on the ITINERIS Critical Zone Virtual Research Environment available on the D4Science e-Infrastructure. This suggests that the code repository might be hosted on this virtual research environment rather than traditional platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To access the repository, free registration to the platform and the Virtual Research Environment is required. The link provided is <https://services.d4science.org/>.
