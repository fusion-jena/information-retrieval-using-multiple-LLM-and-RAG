Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it is mentioned that during model fitting, hyperparameters are determined from the data using methods like maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches. This implies that the choice of hyperparameters may depend on the dataset being used and could vary accordingly. Additionally, the context discusses the use of Neural Networks (NN) as part of the machine learning methodologies, but it does not provide any further information about the specific hyperparameters used within the NN model. Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
