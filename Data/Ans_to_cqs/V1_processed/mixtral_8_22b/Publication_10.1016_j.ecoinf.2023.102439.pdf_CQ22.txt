In order to assess the performance of the deep learning model, several statistical metrics have been utilized. These include the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics offer valuable insights into the accuracy and predictive capacity of the model by quantifying the discrepancy between the anticipated EVI values and the actual observed ones. By applying the W-ANN model, the training values achieved 96% for Iznik and 91% for Alanya, while the projected percentages for all data escalated to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya, respectively. The development of a hybrid model led to an improvement in learning proficiency, resulting in a rise of 18.7% in Iznik and 7.3% in Alanya, as established by the network's performance. These discoveries underscore the heightened predictive abilities and efficacy of the hybrid model in both research regions.
