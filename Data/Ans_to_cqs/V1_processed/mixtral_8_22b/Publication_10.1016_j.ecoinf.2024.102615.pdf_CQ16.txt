In this study, the criterion used to determine when training is complete is maximizing the R value of the validation set. The R value is used as the performance indicator during the optimization process. To find the optimal combination of hyperparameters, the grid search method is employed. This method compares the values of evaluation metrics for different parameter combinations and selects the best ones from a large search space. In this case, the goal is to maximize the R value of the validation set. Therefore, training continues until no further improvement can be made to the R value on the validation set.
