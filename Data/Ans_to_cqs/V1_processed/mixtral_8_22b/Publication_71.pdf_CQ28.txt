The given context does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that a PC with Windows 10 operating system, a GPU card (RTX2070), and 16GB memory was used for training and testing the DeepLabv3+ model, which runs on the TensorFlow framework. However, it does not specify whether the trained model was deployed on any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model based on the provided context.
