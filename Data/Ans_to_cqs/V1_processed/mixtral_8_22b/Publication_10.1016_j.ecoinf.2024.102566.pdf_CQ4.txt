The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the model's ability to generalize by introducing variations into the dataset. It is important to choose appropriate data augmentation techniques based on the nature of the problem and the type of input data being used.
