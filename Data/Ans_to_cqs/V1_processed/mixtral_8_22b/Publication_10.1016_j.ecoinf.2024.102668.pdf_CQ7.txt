The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, common practices in machine learning and deep learning include splitting the dataset randomly or using stratified sampling based on class labels. The typical ratios used are 60-80% for training, 10-20% for testing, and 10-20% for validation. Cross-validation techniques such as K-fold cross-validation can also be employed to ensure robustness and generalization of the trained models.
