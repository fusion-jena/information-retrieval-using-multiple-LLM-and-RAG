After completing the model training phase, several postprocessing steps may be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing techniques include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize which input features contribute most significantly to a model's output by highlighting areas of importance within the input data. This technique can provide valuable insights into how the model makes its predictions and identify any potential biases or weaknesses in the input data.

Calculating various performance metrics allows researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of their trained model objectively. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. These metrics enable comparisons between different models and configurations, helping researchers select the best approach for their particular application.

A confusion matrix is another useful tool for evaluating classification models. It provides a tabular representation of actual versus predicted classifications, allowing researchers to quickly assess the model's strengths and weaknesses across different classes. By examining the confusion matrix, one can determine where the model performs well and where it struggles, guiding future improvements and optimizations.
