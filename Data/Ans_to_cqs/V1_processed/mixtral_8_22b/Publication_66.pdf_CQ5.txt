The paper does not provide explicit details about specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep neural networks can be used with very large input feature sets such as complete pixel arrays for images or x/y values. This suggests that image data could potentially be one type of dataset used in their study. Additionally, the authors mention applying deep learning to animal tracking data or animal behavioral studies, which implies that they may also utilize GPS track data and dive data within their research. Unfortunately, without more specific information regarding the exact datasets employed, it cannot be definitively stated what particular datasets were utilized in their deep learning pipeline.
