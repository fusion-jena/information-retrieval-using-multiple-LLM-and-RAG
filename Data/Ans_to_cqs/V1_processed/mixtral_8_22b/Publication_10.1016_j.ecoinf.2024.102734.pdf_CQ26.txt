The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that both validation and test datasets have a representative distribution of target features to non-target features, indicating that some form of stratified sampling or balanced data collection might be employed. Additionally, the use of transfer learning and pre-trained feature extraction models could help mitigate potential biases introduced by limited or imbalanced datasets.
