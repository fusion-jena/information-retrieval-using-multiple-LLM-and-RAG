The context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that researchers have developed numerous Water Quality Parameters (WQP) inversion algorithms for different lakes over the years. These algorithms include Band Ratio (BR), Three Bands (TB), NDCI, NDTI, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and more. It also states that some scholars have used Landsat satellites to estimate the WQP, while others have used hyperspectral data. Additionally, machine learning (ML) has been applied in various fields due to its powerful ability to handle non-linear relationships. Specifically, Li et al. established a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to estimate Chla concentrations in 45 typical lakes in China based on measured data from 2017 to 2019. Muhammad et al. developed a neural network model called the Ocean Color Network (OCNet) to estimate Chla concentrations in the Barents Sea. Therefore, it can be inferred that remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery or hyperspectral data, may be used as input for deep learning models in estimating WQP. Publicly available datasets, such as those collected by government agencies or research institutions, could also potentially be used as training data for deep learning models. Surveys or sensor data may also be used to collect relevant information for deep learning applications in this domain.
