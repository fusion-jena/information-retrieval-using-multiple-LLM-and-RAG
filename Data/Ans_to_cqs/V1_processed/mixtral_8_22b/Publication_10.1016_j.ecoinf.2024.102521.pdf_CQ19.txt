The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks are used to build the models. However, given that the authors reference several recent publications related to deep learning applications in entomology, it can be inferred that they might be employing popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. These libraries are widely used in academia and industry for building and deploying deep learning models. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the frameworks used, one cannot definitively state which ones were employed in developing the models mentioned in the provided context.
