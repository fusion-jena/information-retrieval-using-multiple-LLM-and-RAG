Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline. However, common methods for gathering raw data include using sensors, conducting surveys or experiments, utilizing publicly available datasets, scraping websites, or even generating synthetic data. Without further details about the project, I cannot provide a more precise response.
