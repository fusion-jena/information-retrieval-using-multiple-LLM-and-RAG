The information provided does not explicitly state the data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for the second experiment consists of footprint images of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). These images were likely used as input for the deep learning models mentioned in the text. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily image data.
