In the given context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, there is a reference to Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) being extensively utilized for image processing. This suggests that the pipeline might be using a form of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for its operations. It's important to note that while the text mentions DCNN, without further specific details about the architecture or implementation, we cannot definitively state that a DCNN is the exact model used in the pipeline.
