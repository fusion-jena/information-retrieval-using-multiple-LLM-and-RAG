The text does not provide explicit information about the purpose of any specific deep learning model. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and others. These models could be used for various purposes including classification, regression, or even object detection depending on their implementation and application. In this particular case, the SVM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is used to construct a calibration model for soil spectral reflectance data. This suggests that the primary goal might be to predict certain properties of the soil based on its spectral characteristics. Nevertheless, without further context, we cannot definitively determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the query.
