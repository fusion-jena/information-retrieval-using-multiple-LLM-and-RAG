The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the authors aim to address the limitation of small amounts of labeled images in each category using existing deep learning techniques combined with statistical fundamentals. Additionally, they reference a paper titled "Automatic fish species classification in underwater videos" which may involve some form of object detection or classification, but no explicit mention of the annotation technique is made. Therefore, without further context, it cannot be determined what specific data annotation techniques were used in this case.
