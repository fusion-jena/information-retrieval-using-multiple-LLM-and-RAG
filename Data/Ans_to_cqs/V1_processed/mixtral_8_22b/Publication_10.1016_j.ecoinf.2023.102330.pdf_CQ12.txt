The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for acoustic detection. This is mentioned in several places throughout the provided context. For instance, it is stated that "Recordings were analyzed using a previously developed CNN model" and later it is referred to as the "covey call acoustic CNN." Additionally, there are references to other studies that have used CNNs for automated identification of avian vocalizations. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that a CNN is the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
