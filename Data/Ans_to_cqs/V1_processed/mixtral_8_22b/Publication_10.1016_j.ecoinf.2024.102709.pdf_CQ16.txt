The criterion used to determine when training is complete is minimizing the loss value during training. Specifically, the goal is to reduce the YOLO loss function, which consists of three components: box loss, classification loss (cls loss), and distributional focal loss (dfl loss). Box loss measures the accuracy of the predicted bounding boxes, while cls loss evaluates the correctness of the predicted classes for each object in the image. Lastly, dfl loss helps the network learn the probabilities of the values around the continuous locations of the target bounding boxes. To achieve this, the training process involves multiple repetitions or epochs, with the aim of reducing these losses. However, there is no explicit mention of using a validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete.
