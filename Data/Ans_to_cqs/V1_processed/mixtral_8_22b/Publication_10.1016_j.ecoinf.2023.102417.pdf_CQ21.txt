After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and visualize its predictions. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are used to highlight the regions of an input image that contribute most significantly to the final prediction of the model. They help identify which features of the input image were important for the model's decision making process.
2. Metrics calculation: Various metrics can be calculated to quantify the performance of the model. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in terms of correctly identifying positive and negative instances.
3. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives produced by the model. This information helps understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model and identify areas for improvement.

In the given context, the authors do not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps they took after training their model. However, based on the information available, we can infer that they likely calculated some form of evaluation metric to assess the performance of their model. Additionally, since they discuss the use of saliency maps earlier in the paper, it is possible that they also generated these maps to gain further insight into their model's behavior.
