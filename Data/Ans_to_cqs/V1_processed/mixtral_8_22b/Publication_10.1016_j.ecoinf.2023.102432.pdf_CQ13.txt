The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It primarily focuses on research papers related to remote sensing, machine learning techniques like Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), and studies on invasive plant species. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in any potential deep learning models mentioned within these sources based solely on this context.
