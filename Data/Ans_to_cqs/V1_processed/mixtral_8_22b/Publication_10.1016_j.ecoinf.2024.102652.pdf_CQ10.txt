Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be suggested that since the paper has been published in Ecological Informatics journal, which encourages authors to share their source codes or datasets, the authors might have shared the code repository link within the original article itself or in the supplementary materials section. Therefore, one should refer to the complete article or contact the corresponding author directly to obtain the required information.
