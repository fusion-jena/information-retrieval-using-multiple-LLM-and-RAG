Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to determine what specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be assumed that some sort of powerful computational resources would have been required due to the complexity of the ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (CNN) being used. This could include GPU or TPU accelerators, but without further details, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
