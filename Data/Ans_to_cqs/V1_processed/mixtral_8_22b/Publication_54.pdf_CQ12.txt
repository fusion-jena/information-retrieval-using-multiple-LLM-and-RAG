The deep learning model used in the pipeline is called Inception-ResNet-v2. This model is a variant of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are widely used for image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features. Inception-ResNet-v2 combines two popular architectures, namely Google's Inception and Microsoft's Residual Network (ResNet), to create a more powerful and efficient model. It uses residual connections within the Inception modules to help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem during training, allowing for deeper networks without sacrificing performance.
