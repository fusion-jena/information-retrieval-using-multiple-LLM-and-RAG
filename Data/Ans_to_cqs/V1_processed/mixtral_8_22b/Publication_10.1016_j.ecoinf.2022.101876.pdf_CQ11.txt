The given context does not provide any specific details about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for processing wildlife camera trap images. The text only mentions that there are challenges associated with big data generated by camera traps and how AI and machine learning can be used to automate the processing of these images. It also discusses the importance of frequent and critical evaluations of model performance but does not mention any specific links to repositories containing the deep learning pipelines or related data. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context alone.
