The context does not provide explicit details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, it can be inferred that the dataset might have been divided randomly into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. Typically, around 70-80% of the data is allocated for training, while the remaining 20-30% is further divided between testing and validation, often equally. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training, while the testing and validation datasets help evaluate its performance and prevent overfitting. In this case, since the research focuses on analyzing the importance of various factors contributing to the popularity of wild bird videos on YouTube, the dataset likely consists of features like objects, text, number of uploaded videos, length, and days since uploading. These features would then be used to train, validate, and test the deep learning models employed in the study.
