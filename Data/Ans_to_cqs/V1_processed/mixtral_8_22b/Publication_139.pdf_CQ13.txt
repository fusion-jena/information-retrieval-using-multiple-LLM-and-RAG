The deep learning model used the optimizer Adam with an initial learning rate of 7. Early stopping was employed to avoid overfitting. The model typically trained between 10 and 15 epochs before training stopped. Each epoch took approximately 1 minute on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Apart from the standard accuracy metric, the area under the curve, calculated using a Riemann sum, was also utilized during training. The model was trained using five-fold cross-validation, reserving 10% of the data for comparing training and validation loss/accuracy after each epoch, and another 10% for performance testing post-training completion.
