The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the batch sizes and learning rates. For SEIO PBW vocalization training, the batch size was set to 5 and the learning rate was set to 1e-4. For blue whale Dcall training, the batch size was set to 4 and the learning rate was set to 1e-3. These decisions were made based on the fact that more samples were used for SEIO PBW vocalization training. Additionally, the models were trained for 40 and 25 epochs respectively, but an early stopping method was used to keep the model weights before they became overfit. The patience parameter was set at 10 epochs for all training phases.
