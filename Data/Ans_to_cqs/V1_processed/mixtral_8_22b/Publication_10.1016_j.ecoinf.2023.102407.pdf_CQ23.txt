The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it mentions some challenges related to poor prediction performance due to overfitting or generalization failure when there is insufficient observational data for the target species. To address this issue, several strategies have been suggested, including spatial extrapolation using models trained with sufficient observational data for external areas and integrating multiple observational datasets collected by different sampling designs. These approaches could potentially improve the generalizability of machine learning-based Species Distribution Models (SDMs). Additionally, the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting can help prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
