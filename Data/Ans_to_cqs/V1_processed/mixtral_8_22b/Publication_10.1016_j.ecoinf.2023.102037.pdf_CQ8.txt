The information provided does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, there are references to two repositories related to similar topics. One is Skalski's 'Make Sense' project available on GitHub (<https://github.com/SkalskiP/make-sense/>), but it seems unrelated to the specific topic of this research. Another reference is to the SmartProtect platform (<https://platform.smartprotect-h2020.eu/en/search?applications%5B0%5D=4>), but again, it doesn't seem directly linked to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the papers. Therefore, without further context or information, we cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
