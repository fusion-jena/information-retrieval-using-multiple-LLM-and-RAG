To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. In the provided context, one such technique mentioned is the class-weighted technique. This method is used to balance the dataset when there is a significant difference between the number of samples in each class. By assigning higher weights to minority classes during training, the model becomes less biased towards majority classes.

Stratified splitting is another commonly used technique to maintain the original distribution of target variables while dividing the dataset into training and testing sets. It ensures that both subsets contain approximately the same proportion of examples from each class.

Oversampling and undersampling are also popular methods to handle class imbalance problems. Oversampling increases the size of the minority class by duplicating its instances or creating synthetic ones, whereas undersampling reduces the size of the majority class by randomly removing some instances. Both approaches aim to achieve a more balanced dataset.

Lastly, diverse data collection is crucial to minimize any potential bias introduced due to limited representation within certain groups or categories. Collecting a wide range of data helps ensure that the trained model generalizes well across various scenarios and populations.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline can involve techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Additionally, the context specifically mentions the use of the class-weighted technique to counteract the inherent bias of deep learning models towards classes with larger sample sizes.
