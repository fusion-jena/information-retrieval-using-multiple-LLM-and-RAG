Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the study uses various datasets related to land use/cover, climate change, and human activities. Given this, it is likely that the data formats used could include geospatial data such as raster images or vector files, time series data like CSV files, or other relevant formats depending on the nature of the input data required by the deep learning models employed in the study.

Final 
It is not explicitly stated what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, possible data formats might include geospatial data such as raster images or vector files, time series data like CSV files, or other relevant formats depending on the nature of the input data required by the deep learning models employed in the study.
