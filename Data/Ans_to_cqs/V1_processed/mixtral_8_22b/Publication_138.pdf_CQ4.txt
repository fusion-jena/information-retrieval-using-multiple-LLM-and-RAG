Unfortunately, there is no information provided about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the given deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and others are commonly used to increase the amount of training data available by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. However, without explicit mention or description of these techniques being employed in the given pipeline, we cannot definitively state which ones were used.
