The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These techniques help minimize the loss function during training, enabling the model to learn patterns in the data. Without explicit mention in the context, it cannot be determined which optimization technique was employed in their deep learning pipeline.
