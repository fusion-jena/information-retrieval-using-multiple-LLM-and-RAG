The data was split based on observation time frames. There are six different observation time frames ranging from 30 seconds/120 frames to 180 seconds/720 frames. Each frame corresponds to a specific amount of time. For each observation time frame, there are three types of datasets: training data, validation data, and test data. The composition of these datasets varies depending on the observation time frame. For example, for the 30 second/120 frame dataset, there are 271,909 observations in the training data, 90,639 observations in the validation data, and 90,636 observations in the test data. This pattern continues for the remaining five observation time frames. It appears that the data was randomly divided into these three categories, but the exact ratio of division is not specified.
