Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they selected the best performing model among VGG, Inception, and ResNet CNNs for creating the rural landscape classification model. It also states that the models were trained on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU with a 256 x 256 image input size, and after parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively. These details suggest that some form of hyperparameter optimization or regularization might have been applied during the model development process, but without explicit mention of regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, I cannot confirm which ones were used.
