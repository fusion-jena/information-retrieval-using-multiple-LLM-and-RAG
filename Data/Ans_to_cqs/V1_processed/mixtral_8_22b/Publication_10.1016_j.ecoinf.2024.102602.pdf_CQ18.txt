The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of 5-fold cross validation. This method divides the dataset into 5 subsets, with one subset being used to evaluate the models using specific performance metrics. The remaining 4 subsets are then utilized for training (90% of the images) and validation (10% of the images). Additionally, an early stop approach is employed with a patience value of 16. This technique halts the training process prematurely if performance on a validation dataset does not improve beyond a predefined threshold. This helps prevent overfitting and conserves computational resources.
