The postprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context include deleting or merging very short events, estimating the typical duration from the examples, using neural network architectures specifically trained to infer and output region annotations, peak picking, thresholding, median filtering, CRNN event filter, split-merge-filter, and deleting very long or short events. However, it does not explicitly mention saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices as part of the postprocessing steps. Therefore, these may not be common postprocessing techniques used in the context of few-shot sound event detection.
