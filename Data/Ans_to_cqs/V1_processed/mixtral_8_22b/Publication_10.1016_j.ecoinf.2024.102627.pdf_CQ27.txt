Unfortunately, there isn't enough context provided to fully understand how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, based on the given information, we can infer that the model was trained using a deep learning framework, possibly TensorFlow or PyTorch, since these are commonly used for such tasks. The model was trained on a set of presence-only observations, using a variety of environmental predictors including WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude). After training, the model was used to predict a set of labels by thresholding the SDM output categorical probabilities associated with species. However, the specific steps taken to deploy the trained model, such as model serialization or platform selection, are not mentioned in the provided context.
