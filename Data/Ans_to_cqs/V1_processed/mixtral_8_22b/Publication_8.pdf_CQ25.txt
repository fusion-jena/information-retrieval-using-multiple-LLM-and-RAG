The purpose of the deep learning model described in this text is not explicitly stated; however, based on the given context, we can infer that its primary function is object detection. This conclusion is drawn from several key points mentioned throughout the passage. Firstly, the authors discuss the application of deep learning techniques to identify species and higher taxa from digitized herbarium sheets, which suggests that the model aims to recognize specific objects within images. Secondly, the paper mentions the implementation of the Detectron2 library in PyTorch framework, which is specifically designed for object detection tasks. Lastly, the description of the model's configuration includes details about the anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network, thresholds for non-maximum suppression, and the use of stochastic gradient descent optimizer â€“ all of which are commonly associated with object detection models. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model may not be directly stated, it appears that its main objective is to detect and classify various plant organs present in digitized herbarium scans.
