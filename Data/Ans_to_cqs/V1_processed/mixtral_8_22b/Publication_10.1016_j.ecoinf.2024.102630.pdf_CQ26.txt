The text does not provide explicit information about the use of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the selection of suitable NDVI products is crucial due to distinct strengths and weaknesses associated with different datasets. Researchers need to consider factors like spatial resolution, temporal coverage, and quality assessment when choosing appropriate NDVI products for their studies. Therefore, while the text does not directly discuss techniques for addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines, it emphasizes the importance of selecting relevant and high-quality data sources for ecological analyses using NDVI datasets.
