Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used to deploy the deep learning model. Instead, it appears that the deep learning model was intended for deployment on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform with limited computational resources. It is also noted that while the model exhibited fast loading times, its practical application on UAV platforms remains controversial due to lack of demonstration in practice.
