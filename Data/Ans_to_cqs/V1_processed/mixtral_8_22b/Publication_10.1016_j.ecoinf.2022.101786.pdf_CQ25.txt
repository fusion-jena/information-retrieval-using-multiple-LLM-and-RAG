The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. This can be inferred from the fact that the authors mention using bounding boxes around detected objects, which is a common technique used in object detection models. Additionally, they refer to the model as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is often used for image analysis tasks such as object detection.
