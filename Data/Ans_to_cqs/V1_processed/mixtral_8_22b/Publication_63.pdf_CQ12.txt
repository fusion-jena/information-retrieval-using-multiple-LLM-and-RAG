The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as its primary deep learning model. Specifically, it employs state-of-the-art CNN architectures such as Inception-Resnet-v2, Xception, and MobileNetV2. Additionally, transfer learning is utilized by employing pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on a dataset from ImageNet.org.
