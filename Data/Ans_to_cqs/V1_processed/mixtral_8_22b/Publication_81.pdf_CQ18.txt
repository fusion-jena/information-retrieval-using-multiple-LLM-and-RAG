The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves dividing the sample into four situations based on the actual classification and the ESK predicted classification. These situations are represented in a confusion matrix, which includes true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). Using this matrix, the classification performance of all experiments is measured by three criteria: accuracy, recall, and F1-score. These evaluation equations are formulated as follows:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-Score = 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)

These metrics help evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model and compare it with other methods. Additionally, Elastic Net was employed to address the issue of overfitting in small datasets and enhance the generalization capability of the ESK model. This approach improved the performance of the proposed model, as demonstrated by the increase in accuracy, recall, and F1-score on various datasets.
