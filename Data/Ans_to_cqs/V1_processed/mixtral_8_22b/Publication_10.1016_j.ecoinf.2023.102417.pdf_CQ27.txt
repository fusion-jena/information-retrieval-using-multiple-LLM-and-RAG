The provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including steps such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer from the given information that after training the deep learning model using appropriate techniques (such as supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised learning), the model would need to be saved or serialized for deployment purposes. This could involve saving the model weights, architecture, and other relevant parameters into a file format compatible with the chosen deployment platform.

As for platform selection, depending on the intended use case, the deployed model might run on various platforms, such as edge devices, cloud servers, or mobile applications. To ensure optimal performance and compatibility, factors like computational resources, latency requirements, and available hardware should be considered during platform selection. Additionally, any potential differences between the training and testing data distributions (data drift or domain drift) must also be addressed through methods like domain adaptation to improve the model's transferability and robustness.
