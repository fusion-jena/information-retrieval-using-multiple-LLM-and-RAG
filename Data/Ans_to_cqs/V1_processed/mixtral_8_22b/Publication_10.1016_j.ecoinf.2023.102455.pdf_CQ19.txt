Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which specific deep learning framework was used to build the described models. The text mentions several machine learning techniques such as CNN-BiGRU, KELM, RVFL, and CNN-BiRNN, but does not specify whether they were implemented using a particular library or framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot definitively identify the framework used for building these models.
