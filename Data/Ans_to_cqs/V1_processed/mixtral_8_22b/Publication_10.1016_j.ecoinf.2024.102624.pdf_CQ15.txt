Based on the given information, it is not possible to determine what specific optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). This is because the provided text does not mention any details about the use of these optimization techniques in the machine learning process. However, it does discuss the application of hyperparameter tuning through a grid search method for Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) algorithms. Additionally, the text mentions the use of the caret package in R for conducting classifications and hyperparameter tuning.
