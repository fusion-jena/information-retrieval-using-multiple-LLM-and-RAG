Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, one preprocessing step mentioned is Local Response Normalization (LRN), which is applied after some convolutional layers. LRN helps enhance the larger response values while reducing the smaller ones, improving the generalization of the model. Additionally, the Dropout technique is employed to prevent overfitting and further improve the model's generalization capabilities. These techniques contribute to preparing the input data for better performance during the training process.
