The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, binary cross entropy loss, model training time, total parameters, and total layers. However, the primary metric used to assess the model performance in this case is accuracy. Each model undergoes training for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32, utilizing 'categorical' class mode which employs one-hot encoding for multi-class classification tasks. The accuracy metric is calculated using the formula A = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN), where TP represents true positives, TN corresponds to true negatives, FP denotes false positives, and FN stands for false negatives. Additionally, other metrics like model training time and total parameters are also considered for evaluating the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the deep learning models.
