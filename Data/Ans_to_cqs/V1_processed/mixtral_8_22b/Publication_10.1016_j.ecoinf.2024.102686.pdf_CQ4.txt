The paper by J. Li et al. does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling were employed based solely on this reference. To find out more about the data augmentation methods used in this study, additional resources would need to be consulted.
