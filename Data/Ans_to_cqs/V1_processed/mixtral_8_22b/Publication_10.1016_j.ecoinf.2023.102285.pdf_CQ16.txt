Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it can be inferred that the performance metrics such as sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC) might have been used to evaluate the model during training. These metrics could help decide if the training should continue or stop. Additionally, the concept of dynamic cut-off points mentioned in the context suggests that the threshold for these metrics may have been adjusted during training to improve their values. Nevertheless, without more specific details regarding the training process, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
