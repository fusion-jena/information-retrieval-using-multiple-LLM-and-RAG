From the given context, it appears that the text discusses the application of a model called Apis-FIS for evaluating landscapes. However, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model or specific measures taken to ensure its generalizability, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query based on the information available.
