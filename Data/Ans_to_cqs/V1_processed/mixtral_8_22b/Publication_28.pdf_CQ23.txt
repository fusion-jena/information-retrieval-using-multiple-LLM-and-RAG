The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models mentioned, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, we do see that two different datasets, namely UCM and AID, were used for experimentation. Using multiple datasets could help improve the generalizability of the models. Additionally, the use of various evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and F2-score suggests that the authors aimed to evaluate their models thoroughly. Nonetheless, without further details regarding data preprocessing, training strategies, or hyperparameters tuning, it remains uncertain whether additional steps were taken to enhance the models' generalizability.
