To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, various techniques can be employed. One such technique is stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target labels across both sets. This ensures that the model does not become overly influenced by any particular label or category.

Oversampling and undersampling are other methods used to balance datasets containing imbalanced classes. Oversampling involves duplicating instances from the minority class, while undersampling removes instances from the majority class. These techniques help prevent models from being biased towards the majority class.

Additionally, diverse data collection plays a crucial role in addressing data bias. By gathering data from multiple sources and ensuring representation from different demographics, cultures, and perspectives, the resulting dataset becomes more comprehensive and unbiased. This helps improve the generalizability and fairness of the trained models.

In summary, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used to mitigate data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Each method addresses specific aspects of bias, contributing to the development of robust and accurate models.
