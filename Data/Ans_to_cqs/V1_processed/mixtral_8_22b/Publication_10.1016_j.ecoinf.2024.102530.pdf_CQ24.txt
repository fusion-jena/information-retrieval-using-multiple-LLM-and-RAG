The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, the provided context does not directly address this topic. Instead, it discusses various aspects related to modeling pollination services, such as the use of different pixel sizes, comparison between literature-based and field data, and different models for evaluating ecosystem services. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query based on the given context.

However, to address the query indirectly, one can mention that randomness is often handled in deep learning pipelines through techniques such as setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing ensemble methods to average out the effects of randomness. These techniques help ensure consistent results across multiple runs of the same model or improve overall performance by combining predictions from several models trained with different initial conditions.
