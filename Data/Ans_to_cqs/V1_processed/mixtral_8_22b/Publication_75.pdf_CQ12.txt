The paper proposes a new model called SeedNet, which is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This model is designed for single seed classification and retrieval tasks. It consists of six learnable layers, five of which are convolutional layers, while the last one is a fully connected layer. The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied after each convolutional layer. Additionally, max pooling layers are inserted between consecutive convolutional layers to decrease the number of parameters and computational complexity, thus controlling overfitting. The input image size is 224x224x3, and the output of the final fully connected layer feeds into an N-way softmax layer, where N represents the number of classes in the dataset. In summary, the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a CNN-based model named SeedNet.
