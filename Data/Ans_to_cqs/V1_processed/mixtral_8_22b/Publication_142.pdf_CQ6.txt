The text does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model used in Pl@ntNet. However, it mentions that the network is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. This suggests that some form of preprocessing might have been applied to both datasets to ensure compatibility during transfer learning.

Preprocessing steps typically involve various techniques such as normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmentation, etc., depending on the nature of the input data. Normalization scales pixel values to a common range (usually between 0 and 1) to maintain consistency across different images. Scaling resizes images to fit a standard size, ensuring uniform input dimensions. Cleaning involves removing noise or irrelevant features from images to improve model performance. Data augmentation generates new samples by applying transformations (rotation, flipping, zooming, etc.) to existing ones, increasing the diversity of the training set.

In the case of Pl@ntNet, since it uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the Inception model with batch normalization, it is reasonable to assume that image normalization was employed. Batch normalization itself is a technique used to stabilize the learning process and accelerate convergence by normalizing layer inputs within mini-batches. Additionally, considering the vast number of species covered (30,261) and the extensive image database (over 2.9 million images), data cleaning and augmentation could also have been part of the preprocessing pipeline to handle potential inconsistencies and enhance the robustness of the model.
