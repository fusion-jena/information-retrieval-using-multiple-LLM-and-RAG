Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available in the given context to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, some insights can still be derived from the text.

From the context, we understand that the authors used Vision Transformer (ViT) models for birdsong classification, specifically focusing on ViT-B/16. They also mentioned adapting the BERT methodology for this purpose. Furthermore, they employed various augmentation techniques during the training phase, such as Gaussian noise, pink noise, primary and secondary background noises, horizontal and vertical rolls, pitch shifts, masks, gain adjustments, loudness normalization, flips, stretches, and tanh-based distortions.

Regarding the specific details of the deployment process, like model serialization or platform selection, these aspects aren't covered in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot offer any concrete information regarding those topics. It would be best to refer back to the original source material or consult other resources for more comprehensive answers.
