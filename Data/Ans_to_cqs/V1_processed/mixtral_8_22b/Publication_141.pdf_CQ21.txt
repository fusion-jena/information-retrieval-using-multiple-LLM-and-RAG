After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of the model and visualize its decision-making process. Some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score; generating saliency maps or gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM) to highlight the regions of input images that contributed most to the classification decisions made by the model; and creating confusion matrices to compare predicted labels against actual labels and identify areas of misclassification. In the given context, it appears that the authors have calculated accuracy metrics and created Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize the relevant morphological traits used by their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for successful classification. However, they do not explicitly mention using other postprocessing techniques such as confusion matrices or saliency maps.
