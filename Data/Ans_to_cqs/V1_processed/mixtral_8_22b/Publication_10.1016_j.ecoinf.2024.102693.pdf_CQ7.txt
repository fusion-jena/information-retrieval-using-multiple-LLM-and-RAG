Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, typically, datasets are divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The most common approach is to use a random sampling method to ensure that each subset has a representative sample from the entire dataset. The ratio of splitting the data depends on various factors such as the total amount of available data, class distribution, and computational resources. Commonly used ratios include 80:20, 70:30, or 60:20:20 for training, testing, and validation sets, respectively. In some cases, more sophisticated techniques like k-fold cross-validation may also be employed to improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model.
