The text mentions one specific method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline: dropout. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to avoid over-reliance on any single feature and encourages the network to learn more generalized representations. In this case, a dropout layer with a rate of 0.25 was incorporated into the architecture of the model used. Other common regularization techniques not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation.
