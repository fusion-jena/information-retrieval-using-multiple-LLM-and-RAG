The text does not provide explicit information regarding which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning model for identifying bird species by their sound. However, it mentions that machine learning algorithms have been developed to automatically identify 3000 bird species by their sound using Xeno-canto, a public, citizen-based birdsong repository. These algorithms likely use popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, but without further details, it cannot be confirmed which specific framework was utilized.
