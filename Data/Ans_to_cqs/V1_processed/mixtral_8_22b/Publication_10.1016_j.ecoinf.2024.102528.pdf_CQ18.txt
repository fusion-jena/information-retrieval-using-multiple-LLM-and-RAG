Based on the given context, it appears there isn't explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, some insights can be derived regarding the evaluation of the model after its training phase.

The study uses BirdNET-Analyzer, a convolutional neural network model, to identify bird species based on their vocalizations. This model has been trained to recognize more than 3000 bird species. After the initial training, the researchers applied the pre-trained model with default sensitivity settings and pre-defined threshold confidence score values of 0.35, 0.25, and 0.15 for the top three identifications. Additionally, species-specific thresholds were employed to filter out false positives while preserving the recall score for individual species.

To evaluate the performance of the BirdNET-Analyzer, the authors conducted tests using annotated calls of 23 species, totaling 4600 vocalizations. They calculated the recall and precision metrics for these tests. On average, the recall was found to be around 29.7%, while the precision was approximately 80.9%. Despite the relatively low recall rate, the high precision indicates reliable species detection for further analysis.

However, the context does not provide details on how the model's performance was monitored during the actual training process or if any strategies like early stopping, validation set usage, or learning curve tracking were utilized. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based solely on the given context.
