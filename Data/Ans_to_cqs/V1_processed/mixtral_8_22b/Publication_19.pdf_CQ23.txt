Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the best performing model was Inception-V3 with a macro Average F1 score of 0.93, which suggests that some form of validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, the use of different neural network architectures such as MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121 indicates that multiple approaches were explored to find the most suitable model for the task. It is also worth noting that the models were evaluated based on their accuracy and size, considering their deployment on IoT edge devices. Therefore, while the exact methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated, it appears that various strategies were employed to optimize its performance and suitability for practical applications.
