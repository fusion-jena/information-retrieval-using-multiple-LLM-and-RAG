The article does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that Random Forest was the method used to build the prediction models, which suggests that traditional machine learning methods were employed rather than deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformers.
