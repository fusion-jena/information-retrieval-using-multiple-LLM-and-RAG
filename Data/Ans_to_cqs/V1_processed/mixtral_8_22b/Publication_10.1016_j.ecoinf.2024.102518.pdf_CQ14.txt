The authors used a combination of feature classes ('L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP') and regularization multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 5 to tune their model. They determined the best tuning parameters by employing the delta in the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc) as the metric. The optimal model was chosen based on having the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0), and any model with delta.AICc <2 was considered credible. Through this process, they found the optimal parameters to be the feature class 'LQP' and a regularization multiplier of 3.5. This approach suggests that the authors likely performed some form of grid search or systematic parameter exploration to find the best hyperparameters for their model. However, the specific method used (grid search, random search, etc.) is not explicitly mentioned in the given text.
