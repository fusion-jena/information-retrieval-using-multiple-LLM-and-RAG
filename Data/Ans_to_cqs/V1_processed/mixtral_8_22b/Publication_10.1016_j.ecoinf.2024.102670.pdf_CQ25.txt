The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated; however, based on the given information, there are two possible purposes. Firstly, in the work of Sharma et al. (2017), the deep learning method could be used for image analysis tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation, specifically for identifying chromosome features in karyotyping images. Secondly, Guo et al. (2021) employed a deep learning-based model for classifying points of interest in 3D volumetric images, where the points of interest could represent cross-over points or overlapping structures. Therefore, the deep learning models serve either as a tool for image analysis or as a classifier for identifying specific features within the input data.
