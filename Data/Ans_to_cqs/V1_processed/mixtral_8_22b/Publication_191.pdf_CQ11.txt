The given text does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used by the authors. However, based on the citation "[6]", which refers to the PlantClef2015 dataset, it can be assumed that the authors might have used this dataset for their study. Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of any links to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repositories in the given text. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used by the authors.
