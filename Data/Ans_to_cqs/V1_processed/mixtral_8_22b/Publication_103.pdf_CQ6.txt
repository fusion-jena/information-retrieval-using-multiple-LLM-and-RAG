Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, some relevant details can be found regarding the initialization and training process of the deep learning models mentioned.

In the context, it is stated that the network is initially trained from scratch on dataset A using a multinomial logistic regression on top of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification layer. This suggests that the input data might have been prepared accordingly to fit these requirements.

Additionally, when dealing with dataset B, the linear classification layer used for dataset A is replaced by a new one aimed at classifying the classes in B. It is initialized with random weights. Other layers remain unchanged to initialize the learning of dataset B with the weights learned from A.

Regarding image processing, simple crop and resize data augmentation was used with the default settings of Caffe. Images had a resolution of 224 x 224 pixels, and a batch size of 16 images was utilized for each iteration during training.

However, without further context, it cannot be determined if any additional preprocessing steps were taken, such as normalizing pixel values, removing noise, or handling missing data.
