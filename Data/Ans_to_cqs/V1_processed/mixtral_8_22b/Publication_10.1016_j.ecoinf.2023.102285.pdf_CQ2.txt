The information provided does not explicitly state what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some clues that suggest it might involve image data. For instance, Fig. 1 mentions "images" being placed in a queue array for processing. Additionally, the mention of "high-pixels-per-image (HPP)" also suggests that the input data could be images. Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of deep learning and machine learning techniques for detecting specific marine small natural objects such as birds, which implies that visual data like images or videos may be involved. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively stated without more explicit evidence, it seems likely that the deep learning pipeline uses image data.
