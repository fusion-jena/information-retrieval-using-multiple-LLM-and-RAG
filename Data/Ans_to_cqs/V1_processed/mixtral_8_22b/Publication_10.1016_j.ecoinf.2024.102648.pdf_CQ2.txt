The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that one of the applications of deep learning is in image analysis for identifying, monitoring, and estimating plant disease severity under field conditions. This suggests that images might be one of the data formats used in this particular application of deep learning. Additionally, the mention of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks implies that structured data such as CSV files could also potentially be used in other deep learning pipelines. Nevertheless, without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data formats are being used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.
