The text does not provide explicit information about the specific format of the data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model is trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset corresponding to different time steps of flight activity recordings. This suggests that the data might be in a time-series format, possibly related to flight activities. Without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact data format is being used.
