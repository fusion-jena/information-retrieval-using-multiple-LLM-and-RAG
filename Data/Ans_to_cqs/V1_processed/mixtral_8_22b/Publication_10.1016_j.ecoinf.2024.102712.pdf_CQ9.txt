The given context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that Sentinel-2 provides data that can be used for various purposes such as fine-scale detection of vegetation in semi-arid mountainous areas. The paper by Congedo (2021) also discusses a Python tool for the download and processing of remote sensing images in QGIS, which could potentially include Sentinel-2 data. Therefore, one possible source for obtaining Sentinel-2 data could be through the use of this Python tool or other similar tools. Additionally, the European Space Agency (ESA) operates the Copernicus program, which includes the Sentinel missions, and their website may have more information about accessing Sentinel-2 data. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
