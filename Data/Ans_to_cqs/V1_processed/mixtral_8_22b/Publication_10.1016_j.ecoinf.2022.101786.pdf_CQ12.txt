The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the deep learning model. This is evident from the mention of CNN in the text, specifically when discussing the training process and performance evaluation of the model. The authors also reference previous work related to ImageNet classification using deep convolutional neural networks, further supporting this conclusion.
