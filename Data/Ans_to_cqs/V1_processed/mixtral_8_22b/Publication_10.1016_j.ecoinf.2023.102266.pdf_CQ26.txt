The text does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, several techniques can be employed to mitigate data bias. These include:

1. Stratified Splitting: In this technique, the dataset is divided into training and test sets while preserving the original class distribution. This ensures that both subsets maintain similar characteristics, reducing the risk of biased results due to imbalanced classes.

2. Oversampling: To counteract class imbalance, oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class or generating synthetic samples using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). This helps achieve a balanced dataset, improving the performance of the deep learning models.

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, undersampling reduces the majority class size by randomly removing instances or selecting only those with high relevance. Although this approach might discard valuable information, it can still help alleviate data bias caused by class imbalance.

4. Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse datasets that cover various scenarios and edge cases can significantly reduce data bias. By incorporating different sources, demographics, and perspectives, the model becomes more robust and capable of handling unseen situations accurately.
