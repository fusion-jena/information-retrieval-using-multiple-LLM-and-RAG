Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain practices might have been employed.

Firstly, the authors mention using various datasets from different sources, including water quality parameters and environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. This suggests that the dataset used for training and testing the model could be diverse, which is one way to improve the generalizability of a model.

Secondly, the authors compare their proposed method with several other machine learning and deep learning techniques, such as SVR, LSTM, BPNN, and others. They evaluate these models based on performance metrics like R2, MSE, and MAE. This implies that the authors may have used cross-validation or similar techniques to assess the robustness and reliability of their model across multiple subsets of the data.

Lastly, while not directly related to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors do mention applying different data processing methods to train and test their proposed method. This indicates that they considered various approaches to preprocess and prepare the data before feeding it into the model, which could potentially impact its overall performance and applicability to new datasets.

However, without further information or explicit statements regarding the use of specific techniques like cross-validation, stratified sampling, or regularization methods, it cannot be definitively stated what exact measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
