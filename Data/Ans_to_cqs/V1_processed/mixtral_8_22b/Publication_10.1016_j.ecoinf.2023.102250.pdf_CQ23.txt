The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, there are some indications that suggest efforts towards improving the stability and robustness of the model. For instance, the use of spectral normalization in the discriminator instead of batch normalization aims to stabilize the training process. Additionally, enforcing Lipschitz constraints on the parameters of the convolutional kernel and the fully connected layer helps maintain Lipschitz continuity, which contributes to the overall stability of the model. While these aspects may indirectly contribute to enhancing the generalizability of the model, they primarily focus on ensuring its stability during training rather than addressing the issue directly.
