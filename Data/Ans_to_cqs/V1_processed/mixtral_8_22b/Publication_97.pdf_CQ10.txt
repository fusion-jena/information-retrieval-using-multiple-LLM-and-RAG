Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any direct mention or reference to a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, it's not possible to provide the exact link to the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository containing the source code for their implementation. However, one can infer that they might have used popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow (reference 62) and possibly other open-source tools like PyTorch or Keras during their research. To find more details about the code used in this work, it would be best to contact the authors directly or look for additional resources related to their project.
