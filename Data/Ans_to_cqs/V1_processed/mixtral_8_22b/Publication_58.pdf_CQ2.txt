Based on the given context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are primarily designed for processing grid-like topology data such as images. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of Red, Green, Blue, and Near Infra-Red channels, which are typically associated with image data. There is no mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV files being used in the deep learning pipeline.
