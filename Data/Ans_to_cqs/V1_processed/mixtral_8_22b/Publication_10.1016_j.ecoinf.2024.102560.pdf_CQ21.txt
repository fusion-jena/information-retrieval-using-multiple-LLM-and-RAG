After model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project or task. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Evaluation metrics: Calculating evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., helps assess the performance of the trained model. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs on unseen data.

2. Confusion Matrix: This is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model. It provides information about actual vs predicted values, true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives.

3. Saliency Maps: These visualize the importance of each input feature towards the final output. They help identify which features contribute most significantly to the predictions made by the model.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: After evaluating the initial results, hyperparameters may need adjustment to improve the model's performance further. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and other techniques can be employed for this purpose.

5. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, stacking, etc., can often lead to better overall performance compared to individual models.

6. Model interpretation: Explaining the reasoning behind a model's decisions is crucial for understanding its behavior and building trust in its predictions. Techniques like LIME, SHAP, Anchors, etc., can be used for interpreting complex machine learning models.
