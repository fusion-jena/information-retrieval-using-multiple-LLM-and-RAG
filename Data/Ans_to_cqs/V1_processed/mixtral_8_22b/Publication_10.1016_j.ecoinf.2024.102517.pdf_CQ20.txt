The deep learning environment used for constructing the deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model was built using Python and TensorFlow, along with GPU and CUDA support. The model was trained on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer for 50 epochs. Therefore, the primary hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is a GPU, specifically an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card.
