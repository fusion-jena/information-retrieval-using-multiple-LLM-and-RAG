Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning applied to the data before training the deep learning model. However, some general practices can be inferred from the context. For instance, the authors mention using thumbnails of whole fish, parts of fish species, and environment, suggesting that they might have resized or cropped the original images to create consistent input dimensions for the model. Additionally, since the model uses a GoogLeNet architecture designed for ImageNet competition, it is reasonable to assume that similar preprocessing techniques like mean subtraction and data augmentation methods (such as rotation, flipping, etc.) may have been employed. Nevertheless, without further clarification from the authors, we cannot provide a definitive list of preprocessing steps involved before training their deep learning model.
