In the given context, there are several datasets mentioned that were used in the deep learning pipeline. One of them is ImageNet, which was used to pre-train the ResNet50 model. ImageNet is a dataset containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. It has been widely used for image recognition tasks and has played a significant role in the development of deep learning algorithms.

Apart from ImageNet, another dataset mentioned is AudioSet, which contains over 2 million human-labeled 10-second audio clips extracted from YouTube videos. This dataset covers a wide range of sounds, including animal noises, musical instruments, and environmental sounds. Similarly, VGG-Sound is also mentioned, which is a collection of 200,000 video clips covering various types of sounds. These datasets can be useful for pre-training deep learning models for audio recognition tasks.

Additionally, some studies have used synthetic clicks or chirps generated by Glotin et al. (2017) and Yang et al. (2021) for pre-training deep learning models. However, it is not explicitly stated whether these datasets were used in the current study.

Overall, the context suggests that multiple datasets can be used for pre-training deep learning models, depending on the specific application and requirements. While ImageNet is commonly used for image recognition tasks, datasets like AudioSet and VGG-Sound may be more suitable for audio recognition tasks.
