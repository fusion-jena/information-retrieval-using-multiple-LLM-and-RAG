Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The text only provides details about the methodology, architecture, and performance of the proposed deep learning model but does not mention any specific links to code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. It would be best to contact the authors directly or search for related publications from them to find out more about the availability of their source code.
