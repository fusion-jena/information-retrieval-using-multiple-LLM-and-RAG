The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it mentions that they used transfer learning with COCO pre-trained weights and a ResNet-101 architecture. Typically, when using transfer learning, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to update the model parameters during backpropagation, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance. It is common practice to divide the dataset randomly but proportionately into these three sets, usually with a ratio of approximately 70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively. However, without more specific details from the given context, this cannot be confirmed.
