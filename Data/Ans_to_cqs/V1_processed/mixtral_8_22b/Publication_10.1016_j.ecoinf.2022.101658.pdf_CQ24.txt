The given context does not provide information on specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, common practices include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to mitigate the impact of randomness on model performance.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors utilized a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation of boreal forest ground cover vegetation composition from nadir photographs. They mention challenges related to overrepresentation of certain classes and high class imbalances affecting their study. While these issues do not directly address handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they highlight potential biases and limitations in applying deep learning models to ecological studies.
