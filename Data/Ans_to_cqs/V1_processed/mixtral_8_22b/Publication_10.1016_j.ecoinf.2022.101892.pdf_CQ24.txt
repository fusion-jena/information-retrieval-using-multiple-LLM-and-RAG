The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions applying aggressive data augmentation techniques like horizontal flipping to avoid overfitting and imbalance problems. This approach could indirectly address randomness by introducing variability into the training process. Additionally, the use of a five-fold subject-exclusive method ensures that subjects do not simultaneously appear in both the training and testing sets, further reducing potential biases or random effects caused by specific individuals.
