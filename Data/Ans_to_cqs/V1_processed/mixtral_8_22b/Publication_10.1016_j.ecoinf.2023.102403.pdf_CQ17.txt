Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Regularization helps to reduce this problem by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization. This encourages simpler models with smaller weights, which can improve their ability to generalize to new data. Two common types of regularization used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training. This means they do not contribute to the forward pass or participate in backpropagation. By doing so, it prevents complex co-adaptations between neurons, reducing the risk of overfitting. During testing, no neurons are dropped out, but their outputs are scaled down proportionally to the dropout rate used during training.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. This discourages large weights, promoting simpler models that are more likely to generalize better. In practice, L2 regularization often leads to smoother decision boundaries and improved overall performance compared to models without regularization.

Other forms of regularization include L1 regularization, which uses the absolute value of the weights instead of squaring them, and early stopping, where training is halted once validation error starts increasing. These techniques can be combined or used independently depending on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the data.
