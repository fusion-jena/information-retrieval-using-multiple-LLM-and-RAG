The method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through camera traps. The study proposes a dataset consisting of 9717 images of 15 wild bird species obtained using camera traps located in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. This dataset was then used to evaluate the performance of eight different deep learning algorithms for bird object detection. Additionally, other studies have also made use of camera traps for data collection, such as those mentioned in the SNAPSHOT USA 2019, NACTI dataset, and Camera traps in Serengeti National Park. These studies captured high-frequency annotated camera trap images from various locations and time periods, which were then used for training and evaluating deep learning models.
