The article does not provide information about the availability of the deep learning pipeline's data repository. Therefore, it cannot be determined if the dataset is accessible through platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Further research would be needed to find out whether the authors have made their data publicly available.
