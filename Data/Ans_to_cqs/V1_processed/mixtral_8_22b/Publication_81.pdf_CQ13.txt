The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that Elastic Net was used to address the issue of overfitting in the model. Elastic Net is a regularized regression method that linearly combines the L1 and L2 penalties of the lasso and ridge methods, respectively. It is known for its ability to perform well when dealing with high dimensional data, like the genetic characteristics mentioned in the text. Additionally, the use of autoencoders (AE) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) is discussed, indicating that these techniques were employed in the deep learning architecture. Nevertheless, without further information, we cannot determine the exact values of hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, or the type of optimizer used in the model.
