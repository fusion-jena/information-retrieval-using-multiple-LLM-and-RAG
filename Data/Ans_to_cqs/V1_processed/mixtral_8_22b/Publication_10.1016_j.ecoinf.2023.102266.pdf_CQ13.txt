The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, there are several modifications and improvements discussed for the proposed model, including updating the criterion to maintain stochasticity while being differentiable, allowing the use of machine learning tools. Additionally, changes in partitions are suggested to increase the number of cells exposed in each iteration, creating another adjustable parameter for improving accuracy and efficiency. Lastly, variance reduction strategies like importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are considered to develop more sophisticated estimators. These details suggest that the authors might have employed various techniques and possibly adjusted hyperparameters during their research; however, without explicit mentions, it is impossible to provide exact hyperparameter values.
