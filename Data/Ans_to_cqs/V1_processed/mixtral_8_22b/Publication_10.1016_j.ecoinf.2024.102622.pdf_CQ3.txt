Based on the given context, it appears there isn't any direct information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, the text does mention the use of the Random Forest Classification method to extract the rice-growing area of Qian Gorlos County from Sentinel-2 images. This suggests that some form of semantic segmentation was likely employed, where each pixel in the image is classified according to its features. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, I cannot provide a definitive list of the exact data annotation techniques used in this case.
