The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is object detection. This is evident from the use of the NASnet architecture with a Faster-RCNN backbone, which are both well-known architectures for object detection tasks. Furthermore, the authors mention computing recall, precision, and F-measure, which are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of object detection models. Additionally, the authors state that they assembled two types of datasets, one containing clips of sharks and another containing clips of non-shark species, further supporting the idea that the model is being used for object detection.
