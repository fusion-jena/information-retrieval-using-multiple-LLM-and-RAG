The text does not provide explicit information about all the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer. However, some details regarding other hyperparameters can be found. The resolution used was 704 Ã— 704, the batch size was 64, and there were 32 subdivisions. The model was trained for up to 6000 iterations. Additionally, during prediction, a confidence score ranging from 0.05 to 1 was assigned to each bounding box. To prevent overfitting, the optimal number of iterations was determined using early stopping, where models trained with different numbers of iterations (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000) were evaluated to find the point where performance was best. Confidence thresholds of 0.05, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.9 were also tested to determine which threshold maximized true positives while keeping false positives to a reasonable level.
