Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning model being referred to is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). However, the exact purpose of this model is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

In general, deep learning models like ANNs can be used for various purposes such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, among others. Given that the context mentions the use of these models for "modeling growth in forest fragments," we can infer that the purpose of this specific ANN could be either regression or time series forecasting, as both tasks involve predicting continuous numerical outputs rather than discrete classes.

Regression involves finding a relationship between dependent and independent variables, while time series forecasting aims to predict future values based on historical data points. Both techniques could potentially be useful for modeling growth patterns in ecological systems like forests.

However, without more specific information about the nature of the 'growth' being modeled (e.g., whether it refers to population size, vegetation density, etc.) or the type of inputs and outputs involved in the ANN, it is difficult to definitively determine its precise purpose.
