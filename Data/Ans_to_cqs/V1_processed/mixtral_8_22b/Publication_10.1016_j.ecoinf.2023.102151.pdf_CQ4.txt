The given context does not provide any direct information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses some common techniques used in data visualization, including reinterpretation, analysis, mathematical modeling, and optimization. These techniques help transform raw data into a more understandable format that highlights the intended information.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available by applying random (but realistic) transformations to existing images. This helps prevent overfitting and improves model performance. While the context doesn't explicitly mention these techniques, they are widely known and used in the field of deep learning.
