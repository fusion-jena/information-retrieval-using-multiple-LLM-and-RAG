The papers cited primarily focus on applications of machine learning and deep learning techniques in various fields such as remote sensing, ecology, and plant species identification. However, they do not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in their respective deep learning pipelines. Nevertheless, we can infer some information about the data formats used in these studies based on the nature of their research.

For instance, Zeiler et al.'s paper discusses visualizing and understanding convolutional networks, which implies that images were likely used as input data. Similarly, Wäldchen & Mäder's study focuses on machine learning for image-based species identification, indicating that images were also utilized in this case. Furthermore, Clapham et al.'s work on automated facial recognition for brown bears suggests that both images and possibly video footage could have been employed as input data.

On the other hand, Vilone & Longo's paper explores notions of explainability and evaluation approaches for explainable AI, implying that structured or semi-structured data formats like CSV files might have been used. Additionally, Collins et al.'s research on hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent for plant species identification may have involved tabular datasets stored in formats such as CSV or Excel spreadsheets.

Lastly, it is worth noting that while most of the mentioned papers seem to use either image or structured data formats, there is no explicit evidence suggesting the use of audio data within these deep learning pipelines. Therefore, without further clarification from each individual study, one cannot definitively state what exact data formats were used across all cases.
