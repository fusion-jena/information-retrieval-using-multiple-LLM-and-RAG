The pipeline uses several types of deep learning models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), Residual Networks (ResNet), and InceptionTime. These are all different types of neural network architectures designed for specific tasks. For example, CNNs are often used for image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features, while LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies, making them suitable for sequential data like time series. ResNet is a type of CNN known for its residual connections which help solve the problem of vanishing gradients in deep networks. Lastly, InceptionTime is a state-of-the-art deep learning model specifically designed for time series classification.
