The study uses a three-layer backpropagation (BP) artificial neural network built using MATLAB R2014b. The first layer corresponds to the inputs aCDOM(254) and Fn(355), while the intermediate and final layers consist of a single neuron each, representing the predictor (TSI). The LASSO model is employed for variable selection and statistical regularization to improve the model's prediction accuracy. However, it should be noted that this approach does not fall into the categories of popular deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformers. Instead, it utilizes a more traditional feedforward neural network architecture.
