The text does not provide specific information on the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses aerial imagery and provides a link to the Git repository where the data and code can be accessed. It also states that the deep learning models were trained using annotated images, but no details about the nature or source of those images are given. Therefore, without accessing the linked Git repository, it is impossible to determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
