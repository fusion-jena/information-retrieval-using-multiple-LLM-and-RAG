Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information regarding the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the data used in the work was supervised by the CHE before its publication through the SAICA and the SAIH. Additionally, it states that the data from April 2020 were not available, possibly due to the lockdown. Without further details, I cannot determine the exact datasets utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
