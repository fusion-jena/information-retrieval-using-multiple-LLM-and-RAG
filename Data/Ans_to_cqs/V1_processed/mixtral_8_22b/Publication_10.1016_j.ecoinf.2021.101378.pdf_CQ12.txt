Based on the given information, it appears that the research paper primarily focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques rather than deep learning models. Specifically, they use Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Entropy Modeling (Maxent) for predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease. There is no mention of any specific deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being employed in their methodology.
