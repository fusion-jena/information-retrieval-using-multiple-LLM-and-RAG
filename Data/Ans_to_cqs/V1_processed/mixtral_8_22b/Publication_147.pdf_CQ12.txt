In the given context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the U-Net CNN architecture is employed, which was initially designed for biomedical image segmentation. This choice is made due to its ability to require fewer training patches and being capable of training within a reasonable time frame. The input data used by the CNN model includes various indices like ARI, Band 2, Band 3, Band 4, DEM, NDVI, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI), REIP, TPI, Topographic Roughness Index (TRI), TWI, VBF, and VH. These inputs differ from those used in the XGB model, as they are tailored to optimize deep learning models effectively.
