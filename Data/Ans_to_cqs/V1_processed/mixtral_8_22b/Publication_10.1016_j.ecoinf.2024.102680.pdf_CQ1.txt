The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Therefore, I am unable to provide a direct answer based solely on the given context. However, it is common practice in deep learning applications to use various sources of data collection depending on the application domain. For example, one might use publicly available datasets, sensor data, or survey data to gather relevant information for training deep learning models. In the case of underwater object detection mentioned in the context, possible sources could include underwater cameras, sonar systems, or existing marine imagery databases. Nonetheless, further details would be required to accurately determine the exact methodologies employed for gathering raw data in this particular scenario.
