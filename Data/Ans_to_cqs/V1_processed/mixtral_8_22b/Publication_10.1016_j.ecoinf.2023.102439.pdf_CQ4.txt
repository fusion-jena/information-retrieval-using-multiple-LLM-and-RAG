Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalizability of the model. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset.

Unhelpful 
The context does not provide any information regarding the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which techniques were used.
