The deep learning model was built using several frameworks and libraries. The primary programming language used was Python. For building the deep learning model, the Keras high-level deep learning library was utilized. Additionally, TensorFlow served as the backend engine for GPU execution. These tools were instrumental in implementing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier.
