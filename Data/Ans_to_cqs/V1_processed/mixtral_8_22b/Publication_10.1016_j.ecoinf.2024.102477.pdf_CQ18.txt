The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves setting specific exponential parameters such as C and ε. These parameters play crucial roles in controlling error tolerance during training and determining the maximum deviation that the model permits for any individual training example. For instance, a higher C value allows for a larger error, making the model more likely to fit the training data but also increasing the risk of overfitting. On the contrary, a smaller C value imposes stricter constraints on the model, thereby increasing the difficulty of fitting the training data but potentially preventing overfitting. Additionally, the parameter ε controls the model's fault tolerance, i.e., the degree of tolerance for differences between predicted and actual values of training samples. Furthermore, the term σ represents a parameter of a Gaussian kernel or the width parameter of a radial basis function kernel, affecting model complexity and generalization ability. Overall, these strategies help ensure optimal model performance during training while minimizing potential errors and overfitting.
