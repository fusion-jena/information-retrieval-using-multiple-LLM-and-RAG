Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of postprocessing steps specifically related to machine learning model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrices, etc. However, the operational workflow described in the context includes several general steps that could potentially encompass some aspects of postprocessing. These include:

* Optimization and elaboration of the obtained results through statistics: This step might involve calculating various performance metrics to evaluate the trained model.
* Mapping and interpretation of the results: This step involves assessing whether the objectives have been met, which could involve creating visualizations like confusion matrices or other types of plots to better understand the model's performance.
* Display of results in an understandable format: This step suggests presenting the results in a clear and interpretable manner, which could involve generating reports or dashboards containing relevant performance metrics and visualizations.
