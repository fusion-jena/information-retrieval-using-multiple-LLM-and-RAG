The paper by Jayasundara, J.M.V.D.B., et al., Dec. 2023 titled "Deep learning for automated fish grading" discusses the application of deep learning in fish grading but does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others. Therefore, based on the information available, it cannot be determined which optimization techniques were applied in this particular study. However, these are common optimization techniques often used in deep learning pipelines.

Unhelpful 
I am unable to determine which optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the paper by Jayasundara, J.M.V.D.B., et al., Dec. 2023 titled "Deep learning for automated fish grading."
