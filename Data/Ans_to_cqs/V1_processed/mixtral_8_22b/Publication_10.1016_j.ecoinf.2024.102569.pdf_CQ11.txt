The given context does not provide information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository link. However, it mentions that platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org are available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Therefore, if these platforms were used in conjunction with a deep learning pipeline, the relevant data could potentially be found within the GBIF database. Unfortunately, without more specific details regarding the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query, I cannot provide a direct link to a particular dataset or repository.
