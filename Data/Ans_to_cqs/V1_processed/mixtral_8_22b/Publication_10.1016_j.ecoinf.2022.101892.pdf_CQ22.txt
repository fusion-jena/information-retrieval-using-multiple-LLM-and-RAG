The study uses Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Cumulative Score (CS) as evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the deep learning models. Accuracy is not considered an effective metric for age estimation tasks. The MAE is calculated as the average absolute difference between the predicted age and the actual age of the pandas across all images. The CS measures the proportion of images where the absolute difference between the predicted age and the actual age is within a certain threshold distance (set to 3 years in this case). These metrics provide a more meaningful assessment of the model's ability to accurately estimate the age of giant pandas.
