Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Two common types of regularization techniques used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst the neurons. This results in a more robust model with better generalization performance on unseen data. The rate of dropout can be adjusted based on the complexity of the problem and the size of the dataset.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of all trainable parameters. By doing so, it encourages smaller weights and prevents any single feature from dominating the decision-making process. This leads to a more balanced and stable model.

Other forms of regularization include L1 Regularization, Elastic Net Regularization, and Early Stopping. These methods have their own strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific use case and should be chosen carefully based on the requirements of the task.
