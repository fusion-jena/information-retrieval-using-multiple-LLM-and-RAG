Two criteria are used to determine when training is complete: correct identification rate and processing time. The researchers experimented with different numbers of training steps and found that 4000 training steps were optimal for most challenges, while 8000 training steps were needed for one challenge due to the larger number of species involved. They also mention increasing the validation parameter to 20%, but do not specify whether this was done to improve accuracy or reduce overfitting. There is no explicit mention of using validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete.
