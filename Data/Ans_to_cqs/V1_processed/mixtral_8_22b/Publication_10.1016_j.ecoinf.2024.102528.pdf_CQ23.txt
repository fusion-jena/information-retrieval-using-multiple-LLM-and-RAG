The authors of the paper presented an automated framework that uses the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for continuous bioacoustic monitoring of bird species. To ensure the generalizability of the model, they applied it to more than 80 species and selected 20 species with the highest recall scores for further analysis. They also generated the Agmon annotated dataset to examine the BirdNET deep learning model and selected 23 species with the highest precision/recall values for further analysis. Additionally, they demonstrated that using BirdNET, the relationships between the confidence thresholds and the precision and recall values are species-specific. Therefore, they used species-specific confidence thresholds to account for the precision-recall tradeoff. However, the paper does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
