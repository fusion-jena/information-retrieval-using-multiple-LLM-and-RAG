The given context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the dataset for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it can be assumed that common practices were followed, such as randomly splitting the dataset into these subsets. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set (used to train the model), validation set (used during the training process to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting), and testing set (used after the model has been trained to evaluate its performance). The exact proportions may vary depending on the specific application and available resources but often follow ratios like 70/15/15 or 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing respectively.
