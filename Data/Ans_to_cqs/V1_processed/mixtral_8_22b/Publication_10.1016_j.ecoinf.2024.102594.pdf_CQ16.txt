The training process is determined to be complete based on two criteria related to the validation loss value. First, if there is no decrease in the validation loss value after five consecutive epochs, the learning rate is halved. Second, if there is still no decrease in the validation loss value after ten consecutive epochs, the training process is terminated. This means that the model stops training once it has reached a point where it can no longer improve its performance on the validation data, even after adjusting the learning rate.
