Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general techniques can be mentioned which are commonly used to handle such issues. These include stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes; oversampling, where samples from minority class(es) are duplicated to balance the dataset; undersampling, where samples from majority class(es) are removed to achieve balanced datasets; and diverse data collection, which aims to gather data from various sources to ensure representation of different groups or categories. It should be noted that these techniques may not necessarily apply to the specific problem discussed in the given context.
