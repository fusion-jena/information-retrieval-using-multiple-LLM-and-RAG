The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various aspects related to improving the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models. It mentions leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies. Additionally, it explores distinctive annotation profiles influenced by the complexity of vocalizations and annotators' strategies. Furthermore, it describes training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on annotations from both novices and experts, highlighting the importance of annotation guidelines encouraging a more conservative approach to improve overall annotation quality. Lastly, it proposes and tests two annotation aggregation methods (majority voting and soft labeling) to optimize the potential of multi-annotation and mitigate the presence of noisy labels.
