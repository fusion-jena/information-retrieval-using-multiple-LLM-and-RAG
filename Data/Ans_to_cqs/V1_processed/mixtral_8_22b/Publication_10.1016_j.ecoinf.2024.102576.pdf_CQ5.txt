Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the application of deep learning models, specifically the U-Net model, for land-cover classification and extraction of ecological information. It mentions that the U-Net model was trained using both training and validation data, but it does not provide details about the source or nature of this data. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of having labeled data for U-Net model applications, particularly in the case of North Korea where there is no official land-cover map available. Given this information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline.
