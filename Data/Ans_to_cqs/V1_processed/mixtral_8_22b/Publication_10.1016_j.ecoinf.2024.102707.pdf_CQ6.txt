The authors do not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training their deep learning models. However, they do discuss some aspects related to image processing such as testing different spatial resolutions of the imagery and using the default settings for YOLOv6 hyperparameters. They also note that they tried various combinations of hyperparameters but found only marginal improvements. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors might have performed basic preprocessing tasks like normalization or scaling, although no explicit details are given about these processes. Additionally, since they mention using the same images at different spatial resolutions, it is likely that they may have conducted some form of image resizing or cropping during preprocessing.
