The text does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, creating confusion matrices, and performing cross-validation. These steps help evaluate the performance of the trained model and identify areas for improvement.

I do not know what the postprocessing steps are after the model training.
