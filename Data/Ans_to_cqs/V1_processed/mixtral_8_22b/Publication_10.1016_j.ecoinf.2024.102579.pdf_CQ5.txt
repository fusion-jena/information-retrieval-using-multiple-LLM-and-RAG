The provided context does not mention any specific dataset used for deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses a study related to forestry using an inventory estimator equation and mentions two other estimators called NN1 and NN2. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
