Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the experiments are conducted using the Google Colab repository, but it does not provide any specific link or reference to a publicly accessible code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
