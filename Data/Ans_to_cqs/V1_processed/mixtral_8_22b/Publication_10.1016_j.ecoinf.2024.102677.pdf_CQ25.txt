The purpose of the deep learning model used in this context is for landscape type classification. Specifically, the authors fine-tuned several state-of-the-art CNN architectures such as VGG, Inception, and ResNet, using a training dataset. They then selected the most effective model to classify different types of landscapes in a case study area. The evaluation of the model's performance was done using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and convergence rate. Based on the results presented in Figure 6, it appears that the ResNet architecture, particularly ResNet50 and ResNet101, performed better than the other models in terms of both accuracy and convergence rate. Therefore, the main goal of this deep learning model is to accurately classify different types of landscapes using high-resolution satellite imagery.
