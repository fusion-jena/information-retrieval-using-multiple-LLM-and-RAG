The provided context does not directly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, based on general practices in machine learning and data science, some common postprocessing steps include evaluating the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC curve, etc. Additionally, creating visualizations like confusion matrices can help understand the types of errors made by the model. Another important aspect could be generating saliency maps to interpret the predictions made by the model. These steps would depend on the type of problem being solved and the chosen algorithm. Unfortunately, without more information about the specific models used in this case, it is difficult to provide a detailed list of postprocessing steps.
