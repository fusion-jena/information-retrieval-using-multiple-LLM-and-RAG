The deep learning pipeline uses several data formats including audio files (.wav), image files (spectrograms), and comma-separated values (CSV). The audio files contain bird songs, while the spectrograms are visual representations of these sounds generated by the data preparation program using the Librosa Python package. These spectrograms have dimensions of 480 x 365 pixels but are resized to 224 x 224 pixels to meet the requirements of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in the pipeline. Additionally, a metadata CSV file is created listing all the necessary classification information for training the CNN and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithms. This CSV file has five columns, one of which lists the file paths to folders containing the bird songs, where each folder is labeled with the dialect type and the year it was collected.
