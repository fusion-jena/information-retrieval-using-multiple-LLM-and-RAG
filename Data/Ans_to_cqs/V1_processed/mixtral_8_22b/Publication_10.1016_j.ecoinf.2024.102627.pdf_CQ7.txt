The text does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does provide some clues about the overall process. After the initial training of the Inception v3 model using the observation set, the model is used to predict the most likely species assemblages on a global regular grid. Then, the model is validated and calibrated on a separate validation set for predicting species assemblages. Once the best epoch has been determined on the validation set, a new training is initiated from scratch on the entire dataset. This suggests that there might have been an initial splitting of the data into training and validation sets, but the exact criteria used for this division are not specified in the given context.
