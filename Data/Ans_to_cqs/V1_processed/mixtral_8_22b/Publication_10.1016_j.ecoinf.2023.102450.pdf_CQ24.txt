The use of deep learning techniques in handling randomness within the pipeline is crucial for achieving accurate results. One common strategy used to manage this issue is setting a fixed random seed value before training the model. This ensures reproducibility by initializing the weights and biases of the neural network consistently across different runs. Another approach involves employing ensemble methods, which combine multiple models trained with varying random seeds to improve overall performance and reduce variance caused by random initialization. Additionally, data augmentation techniques can be applied during training to introduce controlled variations in input data, helping the model generalize better and reducing overfitting due to randomness. Lastly, regularization methods such as dropout and weight decay can also help mitigate the impact of randomness by preventing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize.
