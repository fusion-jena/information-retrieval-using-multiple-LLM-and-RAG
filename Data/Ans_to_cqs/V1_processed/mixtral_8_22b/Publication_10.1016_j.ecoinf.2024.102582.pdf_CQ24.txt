The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or any specific strategies related to managing random seed values. However, some common practices to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce overfitting, and using ensemble models to combine multiple predictions and improve overall performance.
