Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in deploying deep learning models, we can infer some possible methods.

Model Serialization: After training the Mask R-CNN model, it would typically be saved or serialized into a file format such as.h5 or.pb using TensorFlow's built-in functions like `model.save()`. This allows the model to be loaded later without retraining.

Platform Selection: Depending on the application requirements, the platform for deployment could vary. Some popular choices include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc., or edge devices like Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, etc.

Deployment Process: Once the model is serialized and the platform is selected, the next step would involve setting up the environment on the chosen platform. This might require installing necessary libraries and dependencies. Then, the serialized model would be loaded onto the platform and integrated with any other components required for the application. Finally, testing should be performed to ensure everything works correctly before full-scale deployment.
