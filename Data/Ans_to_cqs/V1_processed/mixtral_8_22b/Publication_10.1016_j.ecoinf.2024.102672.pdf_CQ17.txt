Based on the given context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is Dropout. This can be seen from the table where the dropout rate of the dropout layer is listed as one of the hyperparameters. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting. Other common regularization techniques such as L2 regularization are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
