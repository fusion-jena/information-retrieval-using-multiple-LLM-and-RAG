Based on the given context, there isn't specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics like validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. A popular criterion is reaching a validation loss plateau, where the model stops improving significantly on the validation set after several epochs. Other criteria might be based on time constraints, computational resources, or achieving a satisfactory performance level on the validation set. In summary, the context does not provide explicit details regarding the completion criteria for training, but general practices involve observing various performance metrics and setting thresholds accordingly.
