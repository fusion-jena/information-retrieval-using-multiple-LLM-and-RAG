The text does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, there are several references to TensorFlow throughout the text. For instance, it mentions that the model can be converted to TensorFlow Lite format for deployment on an edge device like Raspberry Pi. It also discusses how TensorFlow Lite can be optimized for latency and size of the trained model. Additionally, it notes that TensorFlow or TensorFlow Lite models can be used to run explainability techniques such as Grad-CAM. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively stated without more information, it appears likely that TensorFlow was used to build the deep learning model.
