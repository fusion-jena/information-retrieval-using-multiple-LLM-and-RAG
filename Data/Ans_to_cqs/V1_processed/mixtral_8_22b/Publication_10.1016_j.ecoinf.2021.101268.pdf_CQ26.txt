Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing was performed since the results show accuracy comparisons between raw and preprocessed datasets. Additionally, the table shows that the data distribution is split into 70.12% for training, 1.69% for validation, and 28.19% for testing, which could indicate some form of stratification. Nonetheless, without further details about the exact preprocessing steps taken, it cannot be confirmed what specific techniques were used to address data bias.
