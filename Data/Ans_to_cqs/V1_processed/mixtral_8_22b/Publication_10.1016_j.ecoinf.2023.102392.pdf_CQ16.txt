The context does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the XGBoost model. However, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a minimum error threshold, validation loss plateau, maximum number of iterations, or early stopping based on performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, overall accuracy (OA), or Kappa coefficient. In this case, it appears that the authors have evaluated their model using these metrics, but they do not specify how they determined when training was complete. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
