The paper uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These include the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), and Davies-Bouldin Cluster Validity (DBCV) scores. The ARI is a measure of similarity between two clusterings, while the AMI measures the agreement between two partitions of data. The DBCV score is used to determine the optimal CNN backbone for fine-tuning the model without knowledge of the ground truth labels. Additionally, the paper also considers the energy consumption related to the training of the models, which is estimated using the Python package CodeCarbon.
