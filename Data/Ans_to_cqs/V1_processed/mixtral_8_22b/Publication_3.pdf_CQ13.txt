Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in their deep learning model. However, it does state that they used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks and pattern recognition. Additionally, they mentioned that they found an optimal number of training steps for each challenge, specifically 4000 training steps for all challenges except Challenge 3, where they used 8000 training steps. This information suggests that they likely experimented with various hyperparameter settings during their model optimization process. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the exact values of these hyperparameters, I cannot provide a more precise response.
