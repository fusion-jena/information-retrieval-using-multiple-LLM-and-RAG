The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it mentions two optimization techniques employed in the data analysis process: the Least Squares (LS) method and Genetic Algorithms (GA).

The Least Squares (LS) method is a traditional approach used to find the line of best fit for a given dataset by minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values. In this case, the LS algorithm is used as part of a larger process involving a genetic algorithm.

Genetic Algorithms (GA) are inspired by natural selection processes and are often used for optimization problems. They work by creating a population of candidate solutions, which evolve over time through mutation, crossover, and selection operations. In this study, GA is used to partially optimize the results of the estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. Four random combinations of initial values are generated from the first quarter of the best fit parameter values stored in the database, serving as input for the LS procedure.

Although the mentioned optimization techniques do not directly correspond to those typically found in deep learning pipelines like SGD or Adam, they demonstrate how various optimization approaches can be integrated into complex data analysis tasks.
