The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for classification tasks on complex dolphin sounds. Specifically, the model aims to classify dolphin calls into their respective species. Two approaches were taken to develop the model - a customized architecture and a transfer learning approach using a pre-trained ResNet152V2 architecture. The customized models consisted of three convolutional layers, each followed by dropout and max pooling layers, and then a fully connected layer with ReLU units and a softmax function. The models were trained for 50 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 32. The goal was to find optimal parameters to construct a suitable training dataset to be used as input to CNNs for the classification task. It was discovered that using shorter window sizes generated more accurate models for both tasks.
