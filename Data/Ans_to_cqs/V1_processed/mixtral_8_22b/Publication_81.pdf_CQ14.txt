The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that Elastic Net was used to address the issue of overfitting in small datasets. Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 regularizations, where L1 regularization encourages feature selection and L2 regularization prevents overfitting. This suggests that the authors might have employed techniques such as cross-validation or grid search to find optimal values for the regularization parameters lambda_1 and lambda_2. Nevertheless, without specific details regarding the optimization strategy, we cannot definitively state whether grid search, random search, or another technique was utilized.
