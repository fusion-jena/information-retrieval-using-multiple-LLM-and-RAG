There are several methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be conducted to gather information from individuals about their opinions, behaviors, or experiences related to a specific topic. This method is often used in social sciences and market research.

2. Sensors: Sensors are devices that detect physical changes in the environment and convert them into electrical signals. They are commonly used in fields such as environmental science, engineering, and healthcare to collect data on variables like temperature, humidity, pressure, and motion.

3. Public Datasets: Publicly available datasets are collections of data that have been made accessible by organizations or researchers for use by others. These datasets can cover a wide range of topics and may be used for tasks such as training machine learning models or conducting statistical analyses.

In the given context, it appears that the authors collected water quality data using sensors placed in different locations along a canal. The data was then split into training and testing sets for use in developing and evaluating machine learning models. However, the exact type of sensor used and how the data was collected is not specified in the provided text.
