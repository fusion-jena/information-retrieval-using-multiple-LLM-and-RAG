Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of the specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact location of the code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, it might be helpful to look for related publications or resources from the authors mentioned in the context, like R. Crocker et al., Nikolenko, S.I., Patki, N., etc., who may have shared their work on these platforms.
