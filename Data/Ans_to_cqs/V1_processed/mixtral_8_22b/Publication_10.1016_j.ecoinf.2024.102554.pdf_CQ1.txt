In the context of the SMARTLAGOON project, the method used for collecting raw data involves utilizing a crawling tool specifically designed to gather historical and near real-time data from various Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) products. This tool obtains water quality data from public APIs of major space agencies like the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The collected data includes crucial parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), Chlorophyll-a concentrations, and more. The primary focus of this work revolves around using Sentinel-3 related products due to their ability to provide daily data from the same world region around the same hour, which is essential for developing a monitoring system. Additionally, in situ data sources like CSIC-IEO and CARM contribute to the overall dataset with sampling dates ranging from 2016 to 2022.
