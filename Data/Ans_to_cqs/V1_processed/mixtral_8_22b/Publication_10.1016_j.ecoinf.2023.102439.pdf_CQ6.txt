In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing would have been necessary due to the nature of the data being used.

Preprocessing steps typically involve preparing raw data so that it can be effectively utilized by machine learning algorithms. Common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries.

2. Normalization: This process scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1. It helps prevent attributes with higher magnitudes from dominating those with smaller ones during the learning process.

3. Feature Scaling: Similar to normalization, feature scaling rescales features to improve the efficiency of gradient descent methods. Techniques like Min-Max scaling and Standardization are commonly used.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Machine learning algorithms work primarily with numerical data. Therefore, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical format through encoding techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding.

5. Splitting Dataset: The dataset is often split into training, validation, and test sets. Training set is used to train the model, validation set to tune hyperparameters, and test set to assess the final model's performance.

While these are common preprocessing steps, the exact requirements depend on the specific problem and the type of data being used. For instance, image data might require different preprocessing steps compared to tabular data.
