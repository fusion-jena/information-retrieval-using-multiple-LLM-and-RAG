The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) that are commonly used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some hints about optimization techniques being employed. For instance, the use of Batch Normalization in the YOLOv5s core unit suggests that this technique might be utilized to optimize the learning process. Batch Normalization helps in reducing internal covariate shift, improving gradient flow through the network, and allowing higher learning rates, all of which contribute to better optimization. Additionally, the reference to the paper "Communication-efficient parallelization strategy for deep convolutional neural network training" implies that optimization strategies related to distributed computing might also be relevant in this context. Nevertheless, without more explicit information, it cannot be definitively stated what specific optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
