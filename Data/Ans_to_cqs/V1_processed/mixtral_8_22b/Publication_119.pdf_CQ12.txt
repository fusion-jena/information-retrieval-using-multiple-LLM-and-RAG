In the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a U-Net model. The U-Net model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks. It consists of two parts: a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder). The encoder captures high-level features by applying multiple convolutions and pooling operations, while the decoder reconstructs the original image resolution using transposed convolution or upsampling operations.

In this case, the U-Net model is implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python and has a ResNet-50 backbone that was pretrained on ImageNet. This means that the initial weights of the U-Net model are obtained from a pretrained ResNet-50 model trained on the ImageNet dataset. Using a pretrained model helps reduce the amount of training data required and speeds up the training process.

Additionally, the U-Net model includes dropout and batch normalization layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. The hyperparameters of the model, including the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size, have been optimized to achieve the highest testing accuracy and kappa score among all models.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a U-Net model, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.
