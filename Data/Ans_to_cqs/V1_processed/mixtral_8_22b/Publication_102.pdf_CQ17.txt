Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention the use of the early stopping technique to avoid overfitting during the training process. Early stopping is a form of regularization where the training process is halted when the performance on a validation dataset stops improving, even if the training loss continues to decrease. This helps prevent the model from memorizing the training data instead of generalizing well to new, unseen data. Additionally, the use of pre-trained weights based on the ImageNet dataset for initialization can also be seen as a form of regularization, providing the model with some prior relevant information and helping it converge faster while reducing the risk of overfitting.
