The paper discusses several preprocessing methods used before training a deep learning model like YOLOv8. These include white balance, gamma correction, sharpening, dehazing, denoising, and CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization). White balance adjusts colors in an image to give a more natural look, while gamma correction changes the overall brightness of an image. Sharpening enhances the edges of objects in an image, making them appear clearer. Dehazing removes haze from images, improving visibility. Denoising reduces noise in images, and CLAHE improves contrast in images. These preprocessing steps help improve the quality of input data, leading to better performance of the deep learning model.
