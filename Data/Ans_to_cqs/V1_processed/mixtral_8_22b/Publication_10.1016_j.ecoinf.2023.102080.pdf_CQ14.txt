Based on the given context, it appears that details regarding the optimization of hyperparameters for model fitting are provided in Supplementary Material 1: Text S2. However, the exact methodology used for hyperparameter tuning, whether it involves grid search, random search, or another technique, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this specific query without access to the supplementary materials referenced.
