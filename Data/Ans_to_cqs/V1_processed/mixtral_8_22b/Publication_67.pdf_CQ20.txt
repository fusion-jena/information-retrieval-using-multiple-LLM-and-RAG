The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, there is a reference to a paper titled "Using GPUs for Machine Learning Algorithms" [76], which suggests that Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) might be one of the hardware resources employed for training the deep learning model. This paper discusses how GPUs can accelerate machine learning algorithms due to their parallel processing capabilities. Therefore, it can be inferred that GPUs could potentially be utilized for training the deep learning model mentioned in the context. Nevertheless, without further details or confirmation, it cannot be definitively stated whether other hardware resources such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) were also involved in the process.
