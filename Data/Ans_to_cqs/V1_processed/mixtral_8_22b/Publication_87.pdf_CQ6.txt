The context does not provide explicit information about specific data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions applying various transformations like flipping, brightness, and contrast modifications to improve training. These can be considered part of image augmentation techniques often employed during the preprocessing stage of deep learning projects involving computer vision tasks. The goal is to increase the amount of training data available and prevent overfitting by creating modified versions of existing images. Additionally, the process of selecting a portion of the annotated images for training and another portion for testing can also be seen as a form of data preparation.
