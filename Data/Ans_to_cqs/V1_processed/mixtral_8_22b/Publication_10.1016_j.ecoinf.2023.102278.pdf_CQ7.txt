The table titled "Table 1" provides information about how the data was split for deep learning model training. For both the TLm and GBIFm datasets, the data was divided into two parts - one for training and another for validation. In the case of the TLm dataset, approximately 84% of the data was allocated for training while the remaining 16% was reserved for validation. Similarly, for the GBIFm dataset, around 80% of the data was utilized for training purposes, whereas the rest 20% was set aside for validation. However, there is no mention of any specific criterion or methodology employed for dividing the data into these subsets.
