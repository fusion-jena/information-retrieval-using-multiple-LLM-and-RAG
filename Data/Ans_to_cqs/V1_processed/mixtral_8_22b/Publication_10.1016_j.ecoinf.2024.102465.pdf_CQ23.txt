Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in this research. However, some common methods to improve the generalizability of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, employing cross-validation techniques, or performing stratified splitting during training and testing phases.

In the context provided, it appears that the researchers employed a comparative analysis of various machine learning models such as Rostcm 6.0, Simple Bayesian Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) before deciding to use the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework. While this does not directly address the issue of generalizability, it suggests that the researchers considered multiple approaches to find the most suitable model for their purposes.

Additionally, the fact that they chose to utilize the pre-trained ERNIE model might imply that they aimed to leverage existing knowledge from a more extensive dataset to enhance the robustness and applicability of their model. Nonetheless, without further information regarding the validation strategies adopted by the authors, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
