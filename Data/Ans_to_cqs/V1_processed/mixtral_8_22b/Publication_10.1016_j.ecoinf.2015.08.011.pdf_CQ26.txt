The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then splitting each stratum separately to maintain the original distribution of classes in both the training and validation datasets. This helps prevent imbalanced classes and ensures that the model is trained and validated on representative samples.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the distribution of classes in the dataset. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. These techniques can help improve the performance of the model on imbalanced datasets.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and domains to ensure that the model is exposed to different types of inputs and scenarios. This can help reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

Again, these techniques are not mentioned specifically in the provided context, but they are commonly used in practice to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
