The text does not explicitly mention specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting for ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are indications that efforts were made towards achieving a well-generalized latent space.

One approach mentioned is the use of a higher Î² term in the optimization objective of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This term encourages a well-generalized latent space over good reconstructions, which can potentially improve the model's ability to handle new, unseen data.

Additionally, the model was trained on a dataset that was gradually expanded until satisfactory reconstructions were achieved. This gradual expansion might have helped expose the model to a broader range of examples, contributing to its generalizability.

Lastly, the model's latent space was explored, revealing that traversing different lines in the latent space resulted in smooth transitions between different spectra types. This suggests that the model has learned meaningful representations of the input data, which could contribute to better generalization.
