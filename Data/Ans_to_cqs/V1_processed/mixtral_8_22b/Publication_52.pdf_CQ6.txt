The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, generally speaking, these are common preprocessing techniques employed when preparing datasets for machine learning models including deep learning ones. Normalization typically involves rescaling numeric columns to a standard scale, often between 0 and 1, to prevent attributes with higher magnitudes from dominating those with smaller ones. Scaling is another technique used to bring all features to the same magnitude range, usually between -1 and 1, to ensure equal importance during model training. Cleaning refers to removing noise and inconsistencies within the dataset, such as missing values, outliers, or irrelevant information, to improve the overall quality of the data being fed into the model. These preprocessing steps help enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning model during both training and prediction phases.
