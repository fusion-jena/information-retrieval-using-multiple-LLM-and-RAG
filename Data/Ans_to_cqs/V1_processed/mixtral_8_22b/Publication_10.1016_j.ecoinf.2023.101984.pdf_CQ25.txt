Based on the given context, it appears that a MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) model has been used for analysis rather than a deep learning model. However, I will still provide information about the purpose of this model based on the available context.

The MaxEnt model is being used to analyze the distribution of two Quercus species, namely Quercus pubescens Willd. and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex. This model helps determine the relative contributions of various environmental and territorial variables to the distribution of these species. It does so by calculating the percentage contribution and permutation importance of different variables such as temperature factors, precipitation factors, geographical factors, etc.

Therefore, the primary purpose of using the MaxEnt model here seems to be understanding the ecological niche modeling or habitat suitability of these tree species concerning their environment. In other words, the goal is to identify which environmental conditions best support the growth and survival of these trees.
