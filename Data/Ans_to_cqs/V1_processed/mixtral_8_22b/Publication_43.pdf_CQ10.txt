Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses two popular deep learning models, ResNet and GoogLeNet, which have their respective repositories on GitHub. Here are the links:

1. ResNet: <https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks>
2. GoogLeNet: <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim#pre-trained-models>
