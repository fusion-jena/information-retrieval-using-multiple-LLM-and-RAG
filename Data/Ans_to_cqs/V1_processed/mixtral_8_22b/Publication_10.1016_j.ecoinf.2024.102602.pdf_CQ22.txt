The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics. These include accuracy (ACC), specificity (TNR - True Negative Rate), sensitivity (also known as recall or TPR - True Positive Rate), and F1-score. For the classification task, the term 'positive' refers to the presence of Cortaderia selloana in the images ("With Cortaderia selloana"), while 'negative' indicates its absence. The models' performance is assessed using 5-fold cross-validation over the dataset, providing a robust and unbiased estimate of their performance. This method also guides effective hyperparameter tuning for improved overall performance.
