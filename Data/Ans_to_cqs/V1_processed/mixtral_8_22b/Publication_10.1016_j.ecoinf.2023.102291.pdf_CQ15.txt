The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that the model training and prediction procedures were executed using TensorFlow, which is a popular open-source library for machine learning and deep learning applications. TensorFlow supports various optimization algorithms, including SGD, Adam, and others. Therefore, it can be inferred that some form of optimization technique was employed during the training process, but the exact method remains unspecified in the given context.
