The given context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, it discusses the use of two parameters, Maximum Segments (MS) and Recovery Threshold (RT), in the context of LandTrendr (LTR), a tool for analyzing trends in satellite image time series data. These parameters are used to define the maximum number of segments used for fitting and the threshold of the fast recovery event, respectively. However, they do not correspond directly to typical deep learning hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer.
