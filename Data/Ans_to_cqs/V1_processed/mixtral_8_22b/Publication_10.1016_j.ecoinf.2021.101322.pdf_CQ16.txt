The table provides information on the performance metrics of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), including Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), and Accuracy (%). However, it does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Nevertheless, based on common practices in machine learning, one possible criterion could be the number of epochs without improvement in validation error before training will terminate early. This means that if the validation error does not improve after a certain number of epochs, the training process may stop to prevent overfitting or wasting computational resources. Unfortunately, this piece of context does not specify the exact number of epochs used in this case. Therefore, while we can infer that such a criterion might have been used, we cannot definitively state what it was.
