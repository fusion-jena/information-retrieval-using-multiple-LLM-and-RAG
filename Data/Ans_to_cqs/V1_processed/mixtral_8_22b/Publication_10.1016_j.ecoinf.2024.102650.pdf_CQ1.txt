The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that tweets were used as part of the dataset, suggesting that social media platforms may have been one source of data collection. Additionally, the context mentions that the final available data elements totaled 6802, but it does not specify how this data was collected or what types of data were included beyond tweets. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
