The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions that other studies have used Deep Learning Models (DLMs), specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to model species distributions. In general, DLMs often use optimization techniques like SGD, Adam, or others during training to minimize loss functions and improve model performance. Without further context, I cannot determine which optimization technique was used in these studies.
