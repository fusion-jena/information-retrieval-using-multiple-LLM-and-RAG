The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. The references cited do not appear to include studies related to common image classification datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the focus seems to be on environmental factors and river health assessments. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the specific datasets used in this case.
