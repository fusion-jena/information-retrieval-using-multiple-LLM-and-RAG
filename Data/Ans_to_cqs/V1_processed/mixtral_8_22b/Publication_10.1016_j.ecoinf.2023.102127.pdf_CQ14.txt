The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, whether it's through grid search, random search, or other methods. However, there are references to regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent, which could suggest that some form of optimization technique is used. Additionally, the text mentions that certain models can be computationally intensive, implying that efficient optimization techniques might be necessary. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized based solely on the provided context.
