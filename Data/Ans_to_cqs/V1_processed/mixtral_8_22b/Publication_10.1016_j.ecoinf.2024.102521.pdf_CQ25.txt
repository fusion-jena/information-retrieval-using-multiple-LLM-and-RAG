The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is primarily for object detection and assessment of percentage cover. This is evident from the mention of two open-source and free AI-based tools integrated into the web interface, one for object detection and another for assessing percentage cover. These tools are designed to aid in the analysis of images of trapped insects, allowing users to annotate, search, count, and characterize them morphologically. Additionally, there is ongoing work to integrate the training, storage, and application of taxonomic classification models, suggesting that classification could also be a future purpose of these deep learning models. However, it is important to note that while these models utilize off-the-shelf algorithms for object detection and classification, the unique contribution of this work lies in combining these models with a user-friendly web-based portal and database. Furthermore, there is a stated aim to continuously update the AI models used by STARdbi, potentially expanding their purposes over time.
