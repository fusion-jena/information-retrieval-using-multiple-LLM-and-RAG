The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. This is evident from the use of remote sensing imagery and aerial RGB images throughout the process. Additionally, metadata is stored in CSV format, specifically for FAO's GDA photointerpreted very high resolution plots. However, it should be noted that while not explicitly mentioned, other data formats such as audio or video could potentially be incorporated into the pipeline depending on the specific application or requirements.
