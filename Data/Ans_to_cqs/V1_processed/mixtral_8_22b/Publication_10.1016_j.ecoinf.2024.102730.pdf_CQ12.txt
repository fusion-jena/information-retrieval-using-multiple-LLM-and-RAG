The study uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), which are fully connected feedforward neural networks.

Explanatory  Based on the given context, it appears that the study employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as part of their machine learning approach. More specifically, they utilize Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), which are a type of fully connected feedforward neural network. This means that each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer, allowing information to flow through the layers without looping back. It should be noted that other types of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers were not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the study primarily focuses on utilizing MLPs within the realm of ANNs for their specific task.
