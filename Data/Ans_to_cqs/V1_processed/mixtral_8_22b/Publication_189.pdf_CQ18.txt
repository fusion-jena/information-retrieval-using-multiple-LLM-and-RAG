To monitor the model performance during training, the authors have employed several strategies. They have calculated various types of losses such as rpn\_class\_loss, rpn\_bbox\_loss, mrcnn\_class\_loss, mrcnn\_bbox\_loss, and mrcnn\_mask\_loss. These losses provide insights into different aspects of the model's performance. For instance, rpn\_class\_loss measures the error in predicting whether an anchor is a foreground or background object, while rpn\_bbox\_loss calculates the regression error between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. Similarly, mrcnn\_class\_loss, mrcnn\_bbox\_loss, and mrcnn\_mask\_loss measure the classification, localization, and segmentation errors respectively. By monitoring these losses, one can understand how well the model is performing and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, the authors have also evaluated their model using validation datasets after every few epochs, providing further insight into its generalizability and robustness.
