The text does not provide information about a deep learning model but rather discusses Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models. For these models, several hyperparameters have been mentioned and tuned.

In the case of the RI models, the learning rate was set to 0.05, and the maximum tree depth was set to 4 for both the CS and NW models. Early stopping was employed to prevent overfitting, resulting in 120 iterations for the CS model and 106 iterations for the NW model. A subsample rate of 0.75% was applied in all cases.

For the RY models, a slower learning rate of 0.005 was found to perform better. Additionally, the NW model utilized a very shallow tree with a depth of 2. The number of iterations was maintained at 500.

These hyperparameters were determined either through manual tuning or via grid search, depending on the specifics of the dataset and the desired outcome.
