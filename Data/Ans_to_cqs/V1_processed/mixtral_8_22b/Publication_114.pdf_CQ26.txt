To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets such that each subset maintains the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This ensures that the model does not become biased towards any particular class due to imbalanced representation in the training set.

Oversampling is a technique where additional copies of minority class examples are added to the training set to balance out the distribution between majority and minority classes. This helps prevent the model from becoming overly influenced by the majority class.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing some instances of the majority class from the training set to achieve a more balanced distribution. While this may result in loss of information, it can help improve the overall performance of the model.

Diverse data collection refers to collecting data from various sources and environments to ensure that the model generalizes well across different scenarios. This can involve gathering data from multiple sensors, locations, or time periods. By incorporating diverse data, the model can learn to recognize patterns and variations that might otherwise go unnoticed.

These techniques can be applied individually or in combination depending on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the dataset. Proper application of these methods can significantly enhance the robustness and fairness of deep learning models.
