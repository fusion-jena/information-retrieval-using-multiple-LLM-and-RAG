The table does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the authors have utilized raster and supplementary data for their study. Specifically, they acquired three sets of data from USGS Earth Explorer, but the exact nature of these datasets remains unknown without further context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive list of datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

Based on the second piece of context, we can see that the authors employed the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network with Markov Chain (MLPnn-MC) modeling technique for their research. This approach combines the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain to simulate land use and land cover changes. While this information doesn't directly address the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that the authors may have applied this technique to analyze spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of land use and land cover changes using remote sensing imagery and other relevant datasets.
