The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, top-3 accuracy, f1-score, precision, and recall. These metrics can be found in Table 2 of the given context. Accuracy refers to the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of instances. Top-3 accuracy considers a prediction as correct if the true label is among the three most probable labels predicted by the model. The f1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a more balanced measure of the model's performance. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives, while recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the actual positives.
