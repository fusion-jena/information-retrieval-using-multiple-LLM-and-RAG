The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is instance segmentation. This model is based on Mask-RCNN, a two-stage detector model known for its effectiveness in accurately segmenting objects within complex images. The authors chose Mask-RCNN due to its demonstrated superiority in various segmentation applications. They trained the algorithm initially on one dataset (images of bacteria from Swedish soil) and later expanded its recognition capabilities to include other datasets. The goal was to develop a model capable of accurately capturing and quantifying differences in bacterial abundance and morphology across different environments, thereby demonstrating its proof of concept. Additionally, the authors mention considering integrating faster one-stage models like YOLO into their system for real-time segmentation with microbe species on the chip.
