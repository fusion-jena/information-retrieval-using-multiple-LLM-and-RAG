Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does discuss the use of random forest models, which are a type of ensemble learning method that operates by generating many randomized decision trees. This inherent randomness is managed through the process of averaging the results from each tree, producing a more reliable result than any single tree could generate. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning during model development, but it doesn't explicitly address how randomness related to deep learning pipelines is handled. Therefore, without further information, I cannot provide a detailed strategy regarding handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
