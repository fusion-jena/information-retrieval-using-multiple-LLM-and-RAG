Based on the provided context, it appears that the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) is utilized to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ, removing the impact of heterogeneous observations. This suggests that the RTMSPE could potentially serve as a criterion for determining when training is complete. However, it should be noted that the context does not explicitly state that the RTMSPE is used for this purpose.

Additionally, the context mentions that it may be recommended to perform cross-validation to obtain the RTMSPE or calculate using a validation data-set which is independent of the training dataset. This implies that the RTMSPE could also be used in conjunction with cross-validation or validation loss to determine when training is complete.

Furthermore, the context states that due to computational cost of cross-validation, the RTMSPE is calculated using the training data in this paper. This indicates that the authors of the paper did not use cross-validation or validation loss as a criterion for determining when training was complete. Instead, they relied solely on the RTMSPE calculated from the training data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated what criteria are used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the RTMSPE, possibly in combination with cross-validation or validation loss, could potentially serve as such a criterion.
