Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the specific framework or library used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that a U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), was employed for image classification tasks. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch support CNN architectures like U-Net, but without further details, it cannot be determined which one was used in this case.
