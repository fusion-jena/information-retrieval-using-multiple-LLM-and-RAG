The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred that the authors took some steps towards ensuring the robustness and reliability of their model.

Firstly, they mention training multiple models (M=5), which could potentially help improve the overall performance and reduce overfitting. Secondly, they use a relatively large batch size (B=64) during training, which might contribute to better convergence and more stable gradients. Lastly, they implement early stopping based on validation loss improvement, reducing the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 if no progress is made after 15 epochs. This approach helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model doesn't continue training unnecessarily once its performance plateaus.

While these practices do not directly address the issue of generalizability through diverse datasets or specialized evaluation methods, they still demonstrate efforts to create a well-performing and reliable deep learning model.
