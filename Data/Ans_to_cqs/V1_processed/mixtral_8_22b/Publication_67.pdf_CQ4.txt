The study utilized several data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the sample size and improve the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models. Specifically, they employed a 50% increase in brightness, half-random rotation, random rotation with a factor randomly selected between 0ยบ and 359ยบ, random cropping, and random scaling of image sizes. These techniques help create new variations of existing data without altering their labels, thus enabling the model to learn more robust features and generalize better.
