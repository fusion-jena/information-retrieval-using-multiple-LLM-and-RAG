The data repository for the deep learning pipeline used by C.D. Jolliffe et al. is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it is stated that "the link to the data is shared in the manuscript." Therefore, one would need to refer to the full text of the manuscript to find out where exactly the data has been made available. It could be on any of the platforms mentioned in the query such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but without access to the complete manuscript, we cannot determine which platform was used.
