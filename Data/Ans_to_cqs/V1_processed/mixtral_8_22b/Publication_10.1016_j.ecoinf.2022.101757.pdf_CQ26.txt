The text does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target variables in both sets. This ensures that the model is trained and tested on representative samples from each class.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the number of instances in the minority and majority classes, respectively. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. These techniques can help balance the dataset and reduce bias towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and demographics to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help prevent bias towards certain groups or characteristics.

Without more context, it is difficult to determine which technique would be most appropriate for addressing data bias in the given scenario.
