In the deep learning experiment, the authors aimed to evaluate whether the Single Specimen Per Batch (SSPB) introduced significant bias into their model. To achieve this, they conducted experiments using a dataset without any segmentation applied, except for resizing the images to 224x224 pixels before feeding them into the neural network.

However, the paper does not explicitly mention specific techniques like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Instead, the focus seems to be on comparing the performance of the model between unbiased and biased datasets.

For the unbiased dataset, the authors tried to maintain a 70%-30% distribution for each species in the dataset while avoiding the SSPB issue. They did this by ensuring that images from the same specimen were placed either in the training dataset or the testing dataset, depending on the unique specimen identifier. Although this method made it difficult to achieve the desired 70%-30% distribution, it helped prevent overfitting due to having multiple images of the same specimen in both the training and testing sets.

While these steps may contribute indirectly to improving the model's generalization ability, the paper does not provide explicit details about employing standard practices like cross-validation or stratified sampling to further enhance the model's robustness and generalizability.
