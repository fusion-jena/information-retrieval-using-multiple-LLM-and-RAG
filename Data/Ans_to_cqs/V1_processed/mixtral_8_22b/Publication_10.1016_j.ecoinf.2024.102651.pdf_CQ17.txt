Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. Regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are commonly employed techniques to address overfitting issues in deep learning models. However, without explicit details about the implementation of these methods in the discussed pipeline, it cannot be confirmed if they were utilized.
