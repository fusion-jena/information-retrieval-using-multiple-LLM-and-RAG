The text does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or using random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness in machine learning models include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation techniques, employing ensemble methods, and applying regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. These strategies help ensure consistent results and prevent overfitting by reducing model variance due to random factors.
