Based on the given context, it appears that the authors utilized a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach to evaluate their model performance. This method involves extracting one observation at a time from the dataset and estimating the model parameters using the remaining (n-1) observations. Then, the model is applied to the extracted observation. However, the context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based solely on the information given.
