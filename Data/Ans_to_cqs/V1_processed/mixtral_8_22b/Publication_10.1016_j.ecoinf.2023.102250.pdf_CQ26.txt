Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the context mentions data augmentation which is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. While this doesn't directly address data bias, it can help improve the generalizability of the model by increasing the diversity of the training data. Additionally, the context discusses the use of attention mechanisms and spectral normalization, but these techniques are related to improving the performance of the model rather than addressing data bias. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to the query based on the given context.
