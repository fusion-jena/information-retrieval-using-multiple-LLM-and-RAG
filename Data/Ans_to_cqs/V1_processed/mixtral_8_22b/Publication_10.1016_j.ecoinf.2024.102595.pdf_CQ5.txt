The text does not provide specific information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study employs comprehensive datasets and in-depth research using machine and deep learning techniques for predicting oil palm yields. The datasets likely include various agronomic parameters such as soil composition, climatic conditions, plant age, and farming techniques. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, we cannot confirm if well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized in this particular study.
