To monitor the model performance during training, the researchers employed a grid search approach combined with cross-validation techniques. They defined a range of potential values for each hyperparameter ('numberOfTrees','minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and'seed') based on prior knowledge and literature review. The grid search exhaustively tested all possible combinations of these values and evaluated the model's performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. By minimizing the RMSE, they aimed to achieve the most accurate predictions and enhance the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data. The winning parameters obtained from this process were: numberOfTrees: 150, minLeafPopulation: 3, bagFraction: 1, and seed: 123. Additionally, the researchers used a stratified random sampling approach to capture the full distribution of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps accurately. This ensured that the training/testing dataset accurately represented the distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps, leading to more accurate and representative AGB maps for the study area.
