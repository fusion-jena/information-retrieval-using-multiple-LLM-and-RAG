The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is segmentation. Specifically, the authors implemented a segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) using the U-Net architecture, which was originally developed for biomedical image segmentation. This type of model is designed to identify and delineate specific features within images, rather than simply classifying entire images or detecting objects within them. In this case, the goal was to map wetland classes defined by the Canadian Wetland Classification System across a large area in the boreal forest region of Alberta, Canada, using satellite imagery from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS DEM data acquired through Google Earth Engine. To accomplish this, the authors trained their CNN model using various input variables related to vegetation, topography, and soil moisture, including ARI, band 2, band 3, band 4, DEM, NDVI, NDWI, PSRI, REIP, TPI, TRI, TWI, VBF, and VH. They then compared the performance of their CNN-based approach to a more traditional shallow learning algorithm called XGBoost, which had previously been shown to perform well in machine learning competitions but had limited application in remote sensing literature. Overall, the authors sought to demonstrate the potential benefits of using deep learning techniques like CNNs for large-scale land cover classification tasks in remote sensing.
