The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of remote sensing tools such as airborne and satellite imagery for detecting invasive plant species like Brazilian peppertree in the Everglades National Park. It also mentions the application of a multiple-instance learning algorithm to handle variability or imprecision in the training dataset.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance. Some popular data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These transformations help create new variations of existing data, making models more robust and generalizable.

Since the context does not specify the exact data augmentation methods employed, one cannot definitively state which techniques were utilized in their deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, based on typical practices in image analysis tasks, it is plausible that some combination of these standard data augmentation techniques was implemented.
