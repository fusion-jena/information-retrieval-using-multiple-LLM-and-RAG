The text does not provide explicit details regarding the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the utilization of remote sensing Earth observation data and satellite imagery data for conducting Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) analysis using a deep neural network. These types of data can be collected using various methods, including satellites equipped with sensors capable of capturing multispectral or hyperspectral images, airborne platforms like drones or aircraft fitted with cameras, and ground-based sensors. Additionally, publicly available datasets containing relevant satellite imagery or other Earth observation data could also be employed. Therefore, while the exact methodology is not specified, we can infer that some combination of these techniques may have been applied to gather the necessary data for training the deep learning models.
