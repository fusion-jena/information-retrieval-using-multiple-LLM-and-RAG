The materials and methods section does not provide explicit details about how the data was split for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it mentions that the dataset consists of ecological and air pollution data, which are considered big data due to their large volumes. Additionally, the study uses various tools and statistical models for data analysis, including standardization for pre-processing the data. Unfortunately, without specific information regarding the splitting criteria, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your query.
