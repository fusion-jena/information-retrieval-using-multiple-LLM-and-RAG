Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does indicate that feature selection was performed to maximize the use of limited well data. This could potentially improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Nonetheless, without further information, we cannot definitively state what measures were taken for ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
