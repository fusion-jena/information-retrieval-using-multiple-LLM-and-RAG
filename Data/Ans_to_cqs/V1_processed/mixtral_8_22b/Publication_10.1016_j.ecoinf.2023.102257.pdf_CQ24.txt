The study does not directly address strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. Instead, it focuses on evaluating the effects of machine learning (ML) model performance on tagging efficiency in wildlife monitoring using trail cameras. The researchers conducted experiments using three tagging methods, one with ML bounding box assistance and two without assistance. They found that ML bounding boxes significantly improved tagging efficiency but were dependent on the ML algorithm's performance. Incorrect ML predictions could slow down the tagging process compared to non-hybrid approaches. Therefore, while this research provides valuable insights into optimizing data labeling processes using ML models, it does not discuss specific strategies for dealing with randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
