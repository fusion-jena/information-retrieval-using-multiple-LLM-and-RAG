After the model training process using the ensemble of machine learning models in Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM), there are several postprocessing steps involved. These include:

1. Model Assessment: This involves evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. In this case, the authors use external model assessment data consisting of 80 survey locations for Short-billed Gulls during May 2013 to evaluate the model's performance.

2. Model Diagnostics: This step involves analyzing the importance of different predictors in the model and visualizing their partial dependence plots. In this study, the authors provide three figures (Figures 6-8) showing the partial dependence plots of the first, second, and third top-ranked predictors, respectively. Additionally, they present a 3D partial dependence plot (Figure 9) of the top-ranked continuous predictor (distance to water vs distance to transfer site).

3. Visualization of Results: After the model has been evaluated and its diagnostics analyzed, it is important to visualize the results in a meaningful way. In this study, the authors present two figures (Figures 4 and 5) showing the predicted Relative Index of Occurrence (RIO) for Short-billed Gulls based on the machine learning ensemble and time series data for a 'presence site' in Fairbanks during summer 2017, respectively.

Overall, these postprocessing steps help to ensure that the model is performing well and producing accurate predictions. They also aid in understanding the factors influencing the occurrence of Short-billed Gulls in the study area.
