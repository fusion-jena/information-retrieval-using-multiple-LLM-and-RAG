The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, common practices include splitting the dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters during the training process. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. The proportion of each subset can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the problem complexity, but a typical split might be 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing.
