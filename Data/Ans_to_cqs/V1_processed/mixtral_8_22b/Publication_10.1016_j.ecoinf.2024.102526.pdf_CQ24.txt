The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that careful planning and documentation throughout the entire process of capturing and processing marine imagery are essential to ensure consistency and reduce potential sources of randomness. This includes defining the target population, outlining the planned spatial and temporal extents, describing the habitat or environment of study, detailing the type of imagery, and documenting the use of ancillary data captured. Additionally, the context mentions the importance of considering potential biases introduced by artificial intelligence tools used for detecting and identifying organisms in marine imagery, which might also relate to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, further information on specific strategies for managing randomness in deep learning pipelines would require additional resources beyond the given context.
