Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors have utilized their own custom dataset containing images of fishes, which they have annotated with bounding boxes to indicate the location of the objects within the images. This dataset was then used to train and validate the YOLO model. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were employed to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.
