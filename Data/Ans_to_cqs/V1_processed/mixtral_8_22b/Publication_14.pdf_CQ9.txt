The text does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that a DeepMeerkat executable for Mac and Windows is available for download with the pre-trained hummingbird model. Additionally, there are reproducible scripts for local and Google cloud environments to allow users to train new models. Therefore, while the exact location of the data repository is unknown, it appears that the necessary files and resources are accessible through these means.
