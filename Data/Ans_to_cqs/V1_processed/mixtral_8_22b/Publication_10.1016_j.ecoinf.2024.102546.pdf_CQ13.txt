The primary hyperparameters used in the deep learning models include initial learning rate, learning rate schedule, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold, confidence threshold, weight decay, image size, batch size, classification loss, location loss, data augmentation techniques, and optimizers. For both YOLOX and YOLOv8 models, the initial learning rate is set to 0.01, while the learning rate schedule uses warm-up and cosine decay. The NMS threshold is 0.45 for YOLOX and 0.7 for YOLOv8, with a confidence threshold of 0.25 for both models. Weight decay is set to 0.0005, and the image size is 800 pixels. Both models use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as their optimizer. Classification loss is calculated using Binary Cross Entropy (BCE), and location loss is determined using Intersection over Union (IoU). Data augmentation techniques employed include color jitter and mosaic for YOLOX, and VFL, DFL, and CIoU for YOLOv8.
