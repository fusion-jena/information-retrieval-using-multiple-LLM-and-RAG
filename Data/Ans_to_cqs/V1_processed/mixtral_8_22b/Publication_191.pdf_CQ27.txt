The provided context does not contain information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, based on typical practices in deploying deep learning models, some possible steps could include:

* Serializing the model: After training the deep learning model, it needs to be saved in a format that can be loaded later for deployment. Common formats include HDF5, ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, etc.
* Selecting a platform: Once the model is serialized, it needs to be deployed on a suitable platform. Depending on the application requirements, this could range from cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc., to edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, etc.
* Loading the model: After selecting the platform, the serialized model needs to be loaded onto the platform. This involves writing code to load the model from disk and initialize any necessary variables.
* Making predictions: Finally, once the model is loaded, it can be used to make predictions on new data. This typically involves preprocessing the input data, passing it through the model, and postprocessing the output to obtain the final prediction.
