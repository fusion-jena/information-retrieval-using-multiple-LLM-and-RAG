The information provided does not mention any specific details about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding this topic based on the available context.

Based on the provided context, it appears that the study focuses on building machine learning models using Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). The authors use Optuna library to optimize the structure and hyperparameters of these models. However, there is no explicit mention of any data augmentation techniques being applied in their deep learning pipeline.
