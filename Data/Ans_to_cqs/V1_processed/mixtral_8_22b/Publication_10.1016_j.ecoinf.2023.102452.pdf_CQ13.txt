The given context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. However, some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, and regularization parameters such as dropout or weight decay. Learning rate determines how much the weights should be updated during training, while the optimizer specifies which optimization algorithm to use for updating the weights. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. Batch size refers to the number of samples processed before the model updates its internal parameters, while epochs refer to the number of times the entire dataset is passed through the model during training. Regularization parameters help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model's complexity. Without more specific details about the deep learning model being used, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used.
