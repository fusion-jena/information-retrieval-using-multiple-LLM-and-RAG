The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics. The first metric is the overall accuracy, which is calculated as the percentage of correctly classified pixels. The second metric is the F1 score, which is computed for each class. The F1 score is the harmonic average of precision and recall, where precision is the ratio of the number of segments correctly classified as a particular class to the number of all segments (true and false positives), and recall is the ratio of the number of segments correctly classified as a particular class to the total number of segments belonging to that class (true positives and false negatives). The F1 score ranges from 0 (lowest value) to 1 (best value).
