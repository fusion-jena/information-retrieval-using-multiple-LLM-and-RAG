Based on the given context, the training process consists of 150 epochs with a batch size of 4, and the learning rate starts at 10^-3 and gradually decreases over the course of training. However, there is no explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is completed, such as reaching a certain number of epochs or achieving a desired level of validation loss. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I cannot definitively state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
