Two metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Bias. These metrics are used in addition to Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Nashâ€“Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE).

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the average magnitude of the error in the predicted values. It gives a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In contrast to the similar Mean Absolute Error, RMSE amplifies and severely punishes large errors.

Bias is a metric that measures the difference between the expected value and the actual value. It provides information about the systematic error or deviation from the true value. A positive bias indicates that the prediction tends to overestimate the observation, while a negative bias indicates that the prediction tends to underestimate the observation.
