Based on the given context, there is no direct mention or discussion about specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization for preventing overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. However, some related techniques and concepts can be found within the text.

One technique mentioned is data augmentation, which is often employed to improve model performance and generalizability by increasing the amount of training data available. Data augmentation involves creating new samples from existing ones through various transformations like rotation, scaling, flipping, etc. This helps reduce overfitting by exposing the model to more diverse input variations during training.

Additionally, the context mentions using semi-supervised deep convolutional networks [29] and improved U-Net architectures [23] for image feature extraction with fewer labels. These approaches may help mitigate overfitting since they leverage unlabeled data alongside labeled examples, allowing models to learn better representations without relying solely on limited labeled instances.

Lastly, while not explicitly stated as a regularization method, Adam optimization [27] was referenced in the context. Adam combines aspects of both momentum-based gradient descent algorithms and adaptive learning rate methods, aiming to provide efficient convergence even when dealing with sparse gradients or noisy problems. Although it does not directly address overfitting, proper optimization strategies contribute to achieving well-performing models that generalize effectively across different datasets.
