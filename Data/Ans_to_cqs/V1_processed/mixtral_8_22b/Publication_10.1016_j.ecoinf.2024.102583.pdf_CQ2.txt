The context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning applications, the data could be in various formats such as images, videos, audios, or structured data like CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the type of input required by the chosen deep learning model. For instance, if the task involves object detection or classification, then image data might be suitable. On the other hand, if the task involves time series analysis or forecasting, then structured data like CSV files might be appropriate. Therefore, without further information about the specific application or the chosen deep learning model, it is difficult to determine the exact data format used in this case.
