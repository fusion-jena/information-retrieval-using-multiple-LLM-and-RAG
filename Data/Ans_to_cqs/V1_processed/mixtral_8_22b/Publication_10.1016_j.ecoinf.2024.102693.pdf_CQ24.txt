Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be used to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Fixing the random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value, one can ensure reproducibility in their experiments. This means that every time the code runs, it will produce the same results, making it easier to compare and debug.

2. Using deterministic algorithms: Some machine learning libraries offer deterministic versions of certain algorithms, ensuring consistent output even when using different seeds.

3. Data shuffling: When training a model, randomly shuffling the input data before each epoch helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model learns from diverse examples.

4. Regularization techniques: Techniques like dropout, early stopping, and weight decay help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize across various datasets.

5. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models trained with different initializations or hyperparameters can lead to better overall performance and robustness against randomness.
