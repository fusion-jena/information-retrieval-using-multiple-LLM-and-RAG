Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. None of the sources mentioned in the context discuss or provide details about the optimization methods used for tuning the hyperparameters of the model. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether grid search, random search, or any other optimization technique was used for this purpose.
