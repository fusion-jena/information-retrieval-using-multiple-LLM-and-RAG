The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), or transformer model was employed. Further details would be needed to accurately identify the deep learning model utilized in this case.
