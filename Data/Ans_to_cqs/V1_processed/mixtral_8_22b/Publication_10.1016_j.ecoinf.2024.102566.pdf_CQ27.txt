The text does not provide information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of field-collected data and machine learning methods for developing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) models, but it does not mention any specifics regarding the deployment of these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.
