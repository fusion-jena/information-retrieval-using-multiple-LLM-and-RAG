Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The given context only discusses the use of machine learning and kernel function theory in introducing the kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) but does not provide any details about the specific deep learning model employed.
