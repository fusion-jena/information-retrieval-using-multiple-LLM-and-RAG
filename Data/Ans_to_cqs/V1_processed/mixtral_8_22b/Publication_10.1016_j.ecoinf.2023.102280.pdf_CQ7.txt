The text does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, and validation. However, it does discuss some aspects related to data preparation and requirements for deep learning-based denoising methods, particularly in the field of bioacoustic applications.

In general, the process of splitting data involves dividing the available dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final model's performance.

When preparing data for deep learning-based denoising methods, collecting clean data and superimposing noise profiles is common practice. In bioacoustics applications, obtaining clean recordings might be challenging or even impossible, making the collection of suitable training data difficult. Additionally, the scarcity of vocalizations in these applications limits the creation of extensive datasets.

Regarding data requirements, the text mentions that fine-tuning deep learning models doesn't necessarily need large datasets. It suggests that similar performance can be achieved using a subset of only 100 training examples. Moreover, data augmentation techniques, such as superimposing noise samples, should be considered since bioacoustic applications usually contain abundant noise features.

While the text does not directly address the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it highlights important considerations regarding data collection, preparation, and requirements for deep learning-based denoising methods in bioacoustic applications.
