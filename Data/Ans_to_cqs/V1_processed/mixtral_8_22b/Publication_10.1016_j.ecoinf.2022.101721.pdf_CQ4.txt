The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that machine learning has been used for species identification (Jennings et al., 2008; Parsons and Jones, 2000; Zamora-Gutierrez et al., 2016). In general, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, padding, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and improve model performance by introducing variations into the dataset.
