The paper "Domain randomization for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world" by Abbeel, Pieter, 2017 does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, other papers mentioned do provide some insights into this topic. For instance, the paper "Imagen editor and editbench: Advancing and evaluating text-guided image inpainting" by Wang, Su, et al., 2023 mentions using AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) as an optimizer. Additionally, the note section states that SGD (stochastic gradient descent) is also used as an optimization technique. Therefore, it can be concluded that both AdamW and SGD have been employed as optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines.
