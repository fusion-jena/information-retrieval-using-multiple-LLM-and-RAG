The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the DeepLabV3+ model was trained using the TensorFlow framework and a pre-trained model for the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. In general, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, polygon annotation, pixel-wise labeling, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest, while polygon annotation involves outlining the shape of objects more precisely. Pixel-wise labeling involves assigning labels to each individual pixel in an image, and instance segmentation involves identifying and separating individual instances of objects within an image. Without additional context, it cannot be determined which specific technique(s) were used in this case.
