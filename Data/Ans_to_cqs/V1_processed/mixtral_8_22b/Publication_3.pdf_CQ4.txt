Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline within the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given text. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These methods help increase the size of the dataset and improve the robustness of the model by creating variations of the original images.
