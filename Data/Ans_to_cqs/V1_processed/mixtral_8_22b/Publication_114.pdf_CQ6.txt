The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that batch normalization (BN) is commonly used in many studies to address issues like vanishing or exploding gradients in deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While this isn't directly related to data preprocessing, it suggests that techniques aimed at improving the stability and efficiency of the training process may be applied during or prior to training. To get more detailed information about common preprocessing steps for deep learning models, one would need to refer to additional resources focusing specifically on data preparation for machine learning tasks.
