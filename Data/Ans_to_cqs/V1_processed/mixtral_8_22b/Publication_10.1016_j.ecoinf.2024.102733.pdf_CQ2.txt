The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references cited, we can infer that the data formats used could include images, signals, or time series data such as those found in computer vision tasks, bioacoustic signal classification, and fish event classification. The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Autoencoders further supports this assumption since these architectures are commonly applied to image and signal data. Additionally, the reference to Restricted Boltzmann Machines and their variants for unsupervised pre-training indicates that binary or real-valued input data might have been utilized. Nonetheless, without explicit information about the dataset, it remains uncertain which exact data format was used in the deep learning pipeline.
