The study primarily utilizes morphometric variables derived from camera trap images. These variables include distances, angles, and areas, totaling 124 in number. The researchers used these variables for identifying species and sex for fisher using linear discriminant analyses. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred as numerical data, likely stored in a structured format like CSV or similar. However, it should be noted that the original source of the data is camera trap images, which could potentially be another data format involved in earlier stages of their pipeline.
