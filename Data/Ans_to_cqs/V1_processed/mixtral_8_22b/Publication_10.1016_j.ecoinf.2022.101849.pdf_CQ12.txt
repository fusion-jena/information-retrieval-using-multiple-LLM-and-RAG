In the given context, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used in the pipeline. However, one of the methods mentioned for Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV) mapping is a feed-forward neural network. This type of neural network is not typically classified under the umbrella of deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, feed-forward neural networks are simpler architectures consisting of multiple layers through which information flows in one direction, from input to output. Therefore, while a neural network is indeed used in the described pipeline, it does not fall into any of the categories specified in the query (CNN, RNN, Transformer).
