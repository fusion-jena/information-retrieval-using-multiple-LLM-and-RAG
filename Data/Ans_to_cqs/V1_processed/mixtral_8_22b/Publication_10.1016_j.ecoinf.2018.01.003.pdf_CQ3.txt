The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image or video frame. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object with a unique identifier. It is often used for semantic segmentation tasks.

3. Semantic Segmentation: This technique involves assigning a class label to every pixel in an image. It is useful for identifying different types of objects within an image.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique involves outlining the shape of an object with a polygon. It can be used for both object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

5. Key Point Annotation: This technique involves marking specific points on an object, such as the corners of a rectangle or the joints of a person. It is often used for pose estimation tasks.
