The dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as one of the common datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears that the authors have created their own custom dataset using digitally available occurrence records of orchid species. This dataset includes four main feature groups: geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic. Geographic features include mean latitude and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), number of locations (sensu IUCN), and occurrence records. Climatic features consist of the mean of 19 bioclim variables. Biome features indicate presence in 14 different biomes. Anthropogenic features involve the mean Human Footprint Index. These features were derived from digital occurrence records of orchid species and used to train the IUC-NN deep neural network algorithm to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species.
