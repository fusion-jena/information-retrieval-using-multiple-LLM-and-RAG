The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) method, which is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm. In order to train the RF classifier, labeled training data would need to be generated. While the exact methods used for labeling the training data are not specified, common techniques for image classification tasks could include assigning categorical labels to entire images or individual pixels within the images. It also mentions that acquiring large-scale training data is laborious and time-consuming, suggesting that manual annotation may have been involved. Additionally, the mention of identifying errors in classification and carrying out further work with additional training areas suggests that active learning or other forms of semi-supervised learning may have been employed.
