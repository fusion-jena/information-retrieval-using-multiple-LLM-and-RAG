The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification. Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are used to classify LULC based on satellite imagery. These models can effectively recognize intricate patterns and extract hierarchical features at various scales, including edges, textures, and other complex elements. They eliminate the need for manual feature engineering and reduce manual effort. Furthermore, these techniques allow for the generation of real-time LULC information. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns continuously, capturing temporal shifts and variations in land cover patterns.
