Based on the given information, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, the use of k-fold cross-validation (CV) with k set to 10 is mentioned as a means of evaluating the algorithms and obtaining valid results. Furthermore, there is also mention of tracking the relationship between mini-batch size and both accuracy and the number of epochs required for convergence. However, without further context or specific details regarding the implementation of these strategies, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods were employed to monitor the model performance during training.
