The study uses the RMSProp optimization algorithm with a momentum of 0.9 and epsilon of 0.1. This information is found in the given text, which states, "As an optimization algorithm, we used RMSProp with a momentum of 0.9 and epsilon of 0.1." Therefore, no other optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) were explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
