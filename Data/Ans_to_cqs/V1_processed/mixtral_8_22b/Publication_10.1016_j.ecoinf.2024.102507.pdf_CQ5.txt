The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and discusses the use of popular CNN architectures like ResNet and Faster R-CNN. Additionally, it refers to the ImageNet dataset as an example of a vast dataset used for pretraining models. Nevertheless, without direct mention of the datasets used in this particular study, I cannot definitively state which datasets were employed.
