In the given context, the Siamese Relation Network uses a deep residual neural network (ResNet-50) as its backbone to extract multi-scale features from images of animals. Additionally, it employs a cascade structure of a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for classifying the proposed location boxes. Therefore, the deep learning models used in this pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Specifically, ResNet-50 is utilized for feature extraction, while R-CNN is employed for object detection and classification tasks.
