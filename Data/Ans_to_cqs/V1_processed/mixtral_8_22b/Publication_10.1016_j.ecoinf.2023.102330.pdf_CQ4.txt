The text does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation was used to increase the total number of observations by adding 'known non-detections'. This suggests that the authors might have added synthetic data points to balance the classes in their dataset. The term 'data augmentation' generally refers to various techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, etc., which can help improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by artificially expanding the size of training datasets. In this case, since no specific techniques are mentioned, we cannot definitively state which ones were used.
