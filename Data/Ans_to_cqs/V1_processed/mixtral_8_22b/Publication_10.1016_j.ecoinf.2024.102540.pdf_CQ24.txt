The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of various deep learning models like YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x for detecting alates on sorghum leaves. These models might employ techniques to manage randomness, but specific details aren't mentioned.

In general, some commonly used strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out results from multiple runs, and applying cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness against variations in the training data. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and regularization methods can help reduce overfitting caused by random fluctuations in the data.
