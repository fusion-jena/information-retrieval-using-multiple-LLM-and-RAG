The given context does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve model performance by introducing variations into the training set.

Based on the context, we can infer that the study may have involved some form of data preprocessing or manipulation, such as using occurrence records of species and repeating distinct rounds of software and methods of clipping. However, without explicit mention of data augmentation techniques, we cannot confirm which ones were used in this particular case.
