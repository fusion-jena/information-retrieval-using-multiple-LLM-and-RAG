In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for object recognition and categorization. However, based on common practices in deep learning applications, some possible data annotation techniques could include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within an image, while semantic segmentation entails labeling each pixel in an image according to the category of the object it belongs to. Instance segmentation is a combination of both bounding box annotation and semantic segmentation, where individual instances of objects are identified and labeled separately. These techniques can be applied to large image datasets, such as those used in the present study, to train deep learning models like XGBoost to recognize and categorize different types of forests.
