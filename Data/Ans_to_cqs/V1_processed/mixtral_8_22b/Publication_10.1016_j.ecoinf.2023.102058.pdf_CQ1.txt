Deep learning models require vast amounts of data to train effectively. In the context of water quality prediction using hyperspectral data, various methods are used to collect raw data. These include:

1. Surveys: Field surveys involve physically visiting the site and collecting water samples. These samples are then analyzed in laboratories to determine their biophysical properties such as chlorophyll-a concentration, total suspended solids, etc. This method is often time-consuming and resource-intensive but provides highly accurate results.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors are used to collect hyperspectral data. For instance, satellite or airborne sensors capture images of water bodies from which relevant information is extracted. Ground-based sensors can also be deployed near water bodies to continuously monitor water quality parameters.

3. Public Datasets: Several organizations provide open access to hyperspectral datasets. These datasets have been collected over many years and cover diverse geographical locations. They offer a cost-effective alternative to field surveys and sensor deployment. However, they may not always meet specific research requirements.

In conclusion, a combination of these methods is typically employed to gather comprehensive and reliable data for training deep learning models. It is important to note that the choice of method depends on factors such as budget, available resources, desired level of precision, and project scope.
