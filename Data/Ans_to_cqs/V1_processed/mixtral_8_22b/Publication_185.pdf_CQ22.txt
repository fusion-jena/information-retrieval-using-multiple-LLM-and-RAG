Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall being used to assess the performance of the deep learning models. However, the text does indicate that the models were evaluated based on their performance in the validation set. Specifically, it mentions that the validation accuracy was 94%. This suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics used to measure the effectiveness of the models. Additionally, the context discusses how the recognition rates for different butterfly families changed after implementing data resampling, implying that some form of class-wise performance measurement may also have been employed. Nevertheless, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact metrics were utilized for evaluating the deep learning models.
