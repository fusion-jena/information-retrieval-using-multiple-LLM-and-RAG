The given context does not provide information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on specific criteria such as class labels, ensuring that each subset maintains the same proportions of classes as the original dataset. This technique helps prevent imbalanced datasets and ensures that all classes are represented equally during training and testing phases.

Oversampling is a method used to increase the number of instances in minority classes by duplicating existing examples or creating synthetic ones using interpolation techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). This approach aims to balance the dataset and improve the model's ability to learn patterns within the minority classes.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the size of majority classes by randomly removing instances or selecting only those closest to the decision boundary between classes. By reducing the dominance of majority classes, undersampling can help mitigate bias towards them and improve overall classification accuracy.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering more representative samples across various demographics, geographical locations, or other relevant factors. Collecting diverse data enables models to generalize better and perform well when applied to new, unseen scenarios.

These techniques should be carefully considered depending on the nature of the problem being addressed and the available resources. It is also important to note that no single technique guarantees optimal results, so experimentation and validation through cross-validation or holdout sets may be required to determine which combination works best for a particular application.
