The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred from the text that one possible criterion might be the use of the elbow method. This method is mentioned in relation to identifying the optimal number of clusters or classes for fish freshness classification. While this is not directly related to determining when training is complete, it suggests that some form of evaluation or optimization technique is being applied during the machine learning process. Other common criteria for determining when training is complete include observing a plateau in validation loss, monitoring changes in accuracy or error rates, or setting a predefined maximum number of iterations or epochs. Without further information, it cannot be definitively stated which criteria are being used in this particular case.
