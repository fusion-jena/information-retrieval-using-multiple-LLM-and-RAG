Based on the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the data collection involves using micro-fluidic platforms to gather statistical data of distribution and morphology of live microbes in a soil-analogue environment. This information is valuable for community characterization, as phenotypic traits of living organisms are essential for understanding biological systems. Additionally, the context mentions that enormous efforts have been made to develop deep learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise. Therefore, while the specific data collection methods are not detailed, we can assume that they involve utilizing micro-fluidic platforms and possibly other unspecified techniques to collect data on bacterial abundance and morphology.
