Based on the provided context, there is no mention of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, it discusses various engines used within the ibis.iSDM package for inferring or projecting relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features. These include:

1. Regularized elastic net regressions through the glmnet package
2. Bayesian regularized "Spike-and-Slab" regressions with the BoomSpikeSlab package
3. Bayesian additive regression trees through dbarts
4. Monotonic gradient descent boosting via mboost
5. Extreme Gradient Boosting through xgboost

These engines use either regressions or non-parametric machine learning approaches and are frequentist or Bayesian in nature. However, none of them explicitly mentions deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
