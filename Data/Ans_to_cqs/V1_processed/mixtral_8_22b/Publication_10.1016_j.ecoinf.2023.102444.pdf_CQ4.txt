Unfortunately, there isn't any specific mention of data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline in the given context. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, etc., are often used to increase the size of training datasets by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. These techniques help improve the generalization ability of machine learning models and prevent overfitting. However, without further details about the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, it's not possible to provide a precise list of data augmentation techniques applied.
