In the given context, there is no direct mention or discussion about the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. However, we can still discuss these techniques briefly.

Regularization methods are commonly employed in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to avoid overfitting and improve generalization performance. Two popular regularization techniques are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. This forces the network to learn redundant representations and makes it robust against noise and perturbation. During testing, all neurons are considered without any dropout, but their weights are scaled down to account for the missing neurons during training.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By adding this penalty, the optimizer tries to minimize not only the original loss function but also the sum of squared weights. As a result, the learned weights tend to be smaller, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.

These regularization methods help control the capacity of the neural networks, making them simpler and improving their ability to generalize well to unseen data.
