After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of input images that contribute most significantly to the output prediction made by the machine learning (ML) model. They help identify which parts of the image were important for making the decision, providing insights into how the model is working.

Calculating metrics involves evaluating the performance of the trained ML model based on various criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. This step helps assess the effectiveness of the model in handling new, unseen data.

A confusion matrix is another useful tool for understanding the performance of the ML model. It provides a summary of prediction results on a dataset, displaying the number of correct and incorrect classifications made by the model. The confusion matrix includes four categories: True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN). By analyzing these values, one can determine the strengths and weaknesses of the model and further improve its performance if necessary.

In this particular case, the researchers conducted an experiment to measure tagging efficiency using an ML bounding box model. To analyze their results, they created a confusion matrix (Figure 3) to show the percentages of TP, FP, FN, and TN classification outcomes observed during the experiment. Furthermore, they employed a generalized linear mixed model to investigate the impact of ML model performance and tagging method on tagging efficiency. Their analysis revealed that ML bounding boxes significantly improved tagging efficiency compared to unassisted tagging, but also highlighted that incorrect ML predictions could hinder the tagging process.
