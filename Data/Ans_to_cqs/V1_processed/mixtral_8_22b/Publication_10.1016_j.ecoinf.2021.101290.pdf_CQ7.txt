The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, generally speaking, there are several common approaches to splitting datasets for deep learning models.

One popular method is random splitting, where the dataset is randomly divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the ratio used is 60% for the training set, 20% for the validation set, and 20% for the testing set. This approach assumes that the dataset is representative of the entire population and that each subset contains examples from all classes.

Another method is stratified sampling, which ensures that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. This method is useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where some classes may have significantly fewer samples than others. Stratification helps prevent overfitting on the majority class and improves the overall performance of the model.

Time series data often require a different approach due to their sequential nature. Instead of using random or stratified splits, time series data should be split chronologically. For example, the first 70% of the data can be used for training, the next 15% for validation, and the remaining 15% for testing. This approach preserves the temporal dependencies present in the data and allows the model to learn patterns across time.

In summary, the choice of how to split the data depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem being addressed. Common approaches include random splitting, stratified sampling, and chronological splitting for time series data.
