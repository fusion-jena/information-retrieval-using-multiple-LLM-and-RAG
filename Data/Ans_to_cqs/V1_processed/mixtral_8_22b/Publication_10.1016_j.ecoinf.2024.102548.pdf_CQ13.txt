Unfortunately, the given context does not provide explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer utilized. However, it does mention some other important aspects of the model setup and training process.

For instance, we know that the models were trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32. Epoch refers to a single pass through the entire training dataset, while batch size determines how many training examples are processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.

Additionally, the class mode was set to 'categorical,' indicating that the labels were encoded using one-hot encoding for multi-class classification tasks. One-hot encoding is a method where each category of the target variable is converted into a new categorical column and filled with binary values.

Furthermore, the models were initialized with pre-trained weights obtained from the 'imagenet' dataset. Pre-trained models can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the training process by leveraging previously learned features.

Lastly, the evaluations of model performance were based on the accuracy metric. Accuracy is a common evaluation metric for classification problems, calculated as the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of input samples.
