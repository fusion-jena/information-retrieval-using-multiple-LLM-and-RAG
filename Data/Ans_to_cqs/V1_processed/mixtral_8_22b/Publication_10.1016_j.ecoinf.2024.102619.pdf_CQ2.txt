The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses image data. Specifically, it employs pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like VGG16, which have been trained on the ImageNet dataset. To prepare the input data for these models, the images are resized to 224x224 pixels while maintaining their aspect ratio. After this, the central portion of the images is cropped to create square images. Additionally, the RGB values of the images are normalized according to the training dataset (ImageNet). Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is primarily image data.
