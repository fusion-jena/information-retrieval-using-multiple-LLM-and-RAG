The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that three different machine learning models were used - Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models were trained using a subset of the full dataset, selected through clustering and time series analysis, which resulted in improved performance compared to using the entire dataset. Additionally, the study compares these results with other studies that have used similar input variables but obtained lower accuracy.
