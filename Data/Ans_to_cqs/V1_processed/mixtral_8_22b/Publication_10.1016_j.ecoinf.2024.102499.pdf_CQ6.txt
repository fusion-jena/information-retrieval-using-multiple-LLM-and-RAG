The text does not provide explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions that all images were resized to 1333 x 800 pixels to match with the pre-training data (COCO dataset) used to prepare the first layers of their model. This step is crucial to ensure consistency between the input data and the pre-trained model, which helps improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the training process. Other standard preprocessing techniques may have also been applied but are not mentioned explicitly in this excerpt.
