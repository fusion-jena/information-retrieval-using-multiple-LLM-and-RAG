Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline using strategies like setting specific random seed values. However, some insights can still be derived regarding managing potential issues related to randomness.

One strategy mentioned indirectly is the use of manual annotations to create training, validation, and testing datasets. By manually labeling images, researchers can ensure consistency across different stages of the machine learning pipeline. This approach helps reduce variability introduced by automated processes that may rely on random sampling techniques.

Additionally, the text discusses how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prone to overfitting if they undergo excessive training iterations. To mitigate this issue, the authors mention finding an optimal number of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets starts to diverge due to overfitting. This optimization process involves monitoring both the training and validation accuracy during each iteration, ensuring that the model does not become excessively specialized towards the training data while losing its ability to generalize well to unseen data.

While these strategies do not directly address handling randomness via specific random seed values, they contribute to maintaining stability and reducing unwanted variance within the deep learning pipeline.
