The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it can be inferred from general practices in machine learning and data science that common methods include random splitting, stratified sampling, temporal splitting, or cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation. These methods aim to ensure that the resulting subsets maintain similar statistical properties to the original dataset while also providing a robust way to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data.

In the given context, there is no direct reference to any particular data splitting technique being applied. Therefore, based solely on the information available, one cannot definitively state which criteria were used to divide the data for deep learning model training.
