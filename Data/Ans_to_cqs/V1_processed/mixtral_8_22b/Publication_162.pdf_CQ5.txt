The paper mentions two main datasets used in their deep learning pipeline - the Microsoft COCO dataset and the authors' own RGB-D dataset. The Microsoft COCO dataset was used for pretraining the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. The authors' RGB-D dataset was used for evaluating the performance of D-Mask R-CNN specifically on instances of deer, which were the most common species in this dataset. Additionally, the paper cites several other works that have utilized various datasets, including the Intel RealSense stereoscopic depth cameras dataset, the iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset, and the Part Detector Discovery in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks dataset. However, these datasets do not appear to be directly involved in the authors' deep learning pipeline.
