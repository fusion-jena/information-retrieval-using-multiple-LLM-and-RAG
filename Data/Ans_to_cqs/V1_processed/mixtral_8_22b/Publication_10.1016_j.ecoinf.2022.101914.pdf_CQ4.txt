The text does not provide information on any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Instead, it describes a process for building ecological niche models using Maxent software. This process involves obtaining presence and background points, separating data into folds, setting aside one fold for external evaluation, performing scale optimization for environmental covariates, subsampling background points, and training component models separately using each background point subsample. The described methodology focuses on optimizing the spatial scale of environmental variables and balancing the number of background points relative to presence points rather than applying traditional image data augmentation techniques found in deep learning pipelines.
