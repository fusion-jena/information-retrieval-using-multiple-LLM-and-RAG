The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that a model was trained on the subgroup annotations from the development set AmStP and evaluated on the evaluation sets: SWAMS and ElephantIsland2013 for SEIO PBW and Dcall, respectively. This suggests that the authors might have used cross-validation or similar techniques to assess the model's performance during training. Additionally, they compared the performance of the model trained with non-expert annotations against the performance of the model trained with expert annotations using AUC and mAP metrics.
