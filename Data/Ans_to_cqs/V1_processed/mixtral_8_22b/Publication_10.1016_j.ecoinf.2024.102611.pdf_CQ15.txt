The papers mentioned in the given context primarily discuss various applications of deep learning in plant species identification and classification, including medicinal plants. While they provide valuable insights into the use of deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Global Average Pooling, ResNet-50, and VGG-16, there isn't explicit information regarding specific optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

However, one paper does mention the application of a hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent method for plant species identification (Barhate et al., 2023). This suggests that some form of SGD was employed in their deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, without further details, it remains unclear whether other popular optimization methods like Adam were also explored or compared.

In conclusion, while the papers offer interesting perspectives on applying deep learning to plant species identification and classification, they lack comprehensive coverage of optimization techniques used within these pipelines. Further research may be required to fully understand which optimization strategies have been successfully implemented in this domain.
