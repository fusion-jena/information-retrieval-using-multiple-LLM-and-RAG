Based on the given information, it appears that the authors are utilizing a custom deep learning model called MU-Net. However, without further details about the specific architecture or components of this model, we cannot definitively classify it as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning model. Nevertheless, considering that the study focuses on soil salinity analysis using remote sensing imagery, it can be inferred that the MU-Net model likely incorporates elements commonly found in convolutional neural networks due to their effectiveness in processing image data.
