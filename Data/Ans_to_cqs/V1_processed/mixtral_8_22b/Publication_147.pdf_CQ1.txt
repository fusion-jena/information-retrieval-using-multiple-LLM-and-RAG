The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of remote sensing data, which suggests that satellite imagery is likely being used. Additionally, the mention of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites further supports this idea. It also refers to the use of Google Earth Engine, which is a platform for processing and analyzing geospatial data, including satellite imagery. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data collection involves the use of satellite imagery obtained through platforms like Google Earth Engine.
