The performance of the deep learning models in this study was evaluated using several statistical metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and slope (in linear regression). These metrics were used to compare the measured and predicted values of chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration and turbidity. For instance, when using 20 spectral bands as training features and Chla concentration as the target, LightGBM and XGBoost achieved the best performance. LightGBM had the highest R2 (0.8390) and Slope (0.8126), while XGBoost had the lowest RMSE (5.0617 μg/L) and MAE (3.9776 μg/L). Similarly, when using 17 spectral bands as training features and turbidity as the target, XGBoost achieved the best theoretical generalization ability in five-fold cross-validation (R2 = 0.7927, RMSE = 2.1747 μg/L, Slope = 0.7791, MAE = 1.6791 μg/L).
