Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. However, some common types of deep learning models used in remote sensing applications include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. It is possible that one or more of these models were used in the pipeline, but without further information, we cannot determine which specific model was employed.
