Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation involves applying transformations to the existing data to generate new images that maintain the same class but are slightly different. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adjusting brightness or contrast. These techniques help expand the dataset without acquiring additional data, allowing for the training of larger networks and balancing the data when there are significant differences in the number of examples per class.
