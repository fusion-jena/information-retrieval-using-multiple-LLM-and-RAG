To evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, various metrics are employed. These include accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. Accuracy measures the proportion of true positive and true negative predictions among the total number of cases examined. Precision indicates the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall, also known as sensitivity, calculates the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly. Specificity determines the proportion of negatives that were identified correctly. Lastly, the F1-score provides a harmonic mean between precision and recall, offering a single metric that balances both concerns.
