The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it mentions that cow-specific parameters were fitted into the model, which could contribute to its ability to accurately detect cow vocalizations. This suggests that the model may have been tailored to better suit the characteristics of cow vocalizations, potentially improving its performance and applicability across different datasets featuring cow sounds.
