Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred from the context that the authors have attempted to improve the robustness and adaptability of their model by conducting a series of ablation experiments involving ten different network architectures based on YOLOv8. Each experiment was designed to modify certain aspects of the original model, including the addition of new modules like the Multicat module, Reduced detection head, and C2flite module, as well as modifications to existing ones like the SPPF module. By evaluating these changes across multiple experiments, the authors aimed to identify the most effective combinations of improvements that could lead to better overall performance without significantly increasing computational complexity. While not directly addressing generalizability, these efforts suggest a focus on creating a more versatile and efficient model capable of handling a wider range of scenarios.
