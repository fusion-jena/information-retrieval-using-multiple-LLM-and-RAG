The given context does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several common methods used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to handle data imbalance and bias, including stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly selecting instances from each subset to maintain the original distribution. This technique can help ensure that minority classes are adequately represented in both the training and validation sets.

Oversampling refers to increasing the number of instances belonging to underrepresented classes by duplicating existing examples or generating new ones through interpolation or extrapolation techniques. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular example of an oversampling algorithm.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the size of the majority class(es) by removing some instances to balance the dataset. Random Under-Sampling (RUS), NearMiss, and Condensed Nearest Neighbor Rule (CNNR) are well-known undersampling algorithms.

Lastly, collecting diverse data can also mitigate biases introduced by limited representation in datasets. By gathering more varied examples, researchers can improve the generalizability and robustness of their models across different scenarios and populations.

In summary, while the given context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, commonly used approaches include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
