The paper by P.R. Kaushik et al. does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several datasets related to climate and hydrological variables such as Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS), Soil Moisture Storage (SMS), Groundwater Storage (GWS), Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), El-Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), North Tropical Atlantic (NTA), South Tropical Atlantic (STA), and Equatorial Atlantic (ETA). These datasets have different spatial and temporal resolutions and sources. The paper also references other studies that use various datasets, including those focused on drought characteristics, hydrological risks, and groundwater recovery. However, without more specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in this study, it is impossible to determine which datasets were utilized.
