The given context does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, generally speaking, common preprocessing steps include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmentation, and encoding. Data normalization involves rescaling numeric columns to have a mean value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Scaling refers to transforming the range of independent variables or predictors to a certain scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent entries. Augmentation includes techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, cropping, padding, etc., which help increase the amount of training data. Encoding is converting categorical data into numerical form so that machine learning algorithms can process them.
