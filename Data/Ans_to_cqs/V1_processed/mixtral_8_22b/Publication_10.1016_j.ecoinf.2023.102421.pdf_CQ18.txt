To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. They divided their training dataset into two parts, where 80% was utilized for training and validation purposes, while the remaining 20% was reserved as unseen data for testing. During this process, they aimed to minimize any potential biases. Additionally, they used mean Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the objective function (loss function) to evaluate the performance of the models.
