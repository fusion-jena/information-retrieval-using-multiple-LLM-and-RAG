The text does not provide explicit information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning and computer vision tasks, some possible postprocessing steps could include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics such as accuracy or precision, creating confusion matrices, or performing other forms of evaluation or analysis. It is important to note that these potential postprocessing steps are speculative and may not be applicable to this particular study without further context.
