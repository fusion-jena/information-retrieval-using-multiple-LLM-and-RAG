Based on the given context, it appears that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets for the deep learning pipeline. However, there isn't specific information about how the raw data was collected before being manually annotated. Generally, in deep learning pipelines, raw data can be collected through various means such as surveys, sensors, public datasets, etc. Surveys could involve using underwater vehicles equipped with cameras to capture images or videos of the deep sea environment. Sensors could include devices like sonar systems to gather acoustic data or other specialized equipment to measure physical properties like temperature, salinity, etc. Public datasets refer to existing databases containing relevant information which can be accessed and used for analysis. It should also be noted that collecting representative datasets in the deep sea poses significant challenges due to its vastness and difficult accessibility.
