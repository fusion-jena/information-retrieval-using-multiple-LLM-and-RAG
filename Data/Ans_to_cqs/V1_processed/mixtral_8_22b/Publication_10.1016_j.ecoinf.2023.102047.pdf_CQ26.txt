The authors use several techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline. They apply data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal/vertical flipping, image rotation, image translation, zooming, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, hue and saturation adjustment, gaussian noise, and random erasing. These techniques help increase the size and variability of their dataset, which helps prevent overfitting and makes the model more generalized. Additionally, they mention the use of domain adaptation models to mitigate the issue of data distribution shifts in different locations. However, they do not specifically mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used for addressing data bias.
