Based on the given context, it appears that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images, specifically satellite images. This is evident through the mention of applications such as satellite image-based vegetation indices and the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation across various types of young vegetation cover. Furthermore, the study by Cameron et al. (2022) focuses on ground cover vegetation composition from nadir photographs using DCNN. Therefore, it can be concluded that the main data format utilized in this context is image data.
