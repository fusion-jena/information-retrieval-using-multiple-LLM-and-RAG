The information provided does not mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the deep learning pipeline might be available. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is located based on the given context. Further research would be required to find out if the deep learning pipeline has been made publicly available and where it can be accessed.
