The provided context does not explicitly mention what specific data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning methods are being widely applied to create models directly from large volumes of complex data. This suggests that various types of data formats could potentially be used in the deep learning pipeline, such as images, audio files, videos, or structured data like CSV files. The choice of data format would depend on the specific application and problem domain. For instance, if the goal is to analyze air pollution levels based on satellite imagery, then the data format used might be images. On the other hand, if the objective is to predict agricultural product sales based on historical sales data, then the data format might be a CSV file containing time-series data. Therefore, without further information about the specific use case, it is difficult to determine exactly what data format is used in the deep learning pipeline.
