The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the authors may use common machine learning practices such as monitoring the validation loss or accuracy over epochs and stopping the training process once the model performance has reached a satisfactory level or stopped improving significantly. It is important to note that this information is not directly stated in the provided context, so further clarification would be needed to provide a definitive answer.
