The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific methods or sources for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets could potentially be used based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning applications. For instance, Allken et al. (2021) use trawl camera images for identifying and counting fish species, which suggests the use of sensor data collection. Similarly, Bay et al. (2006) employ computer vision techniques for feature extraction, indicating the potential use of image datasets. Nevertheless, the exact methods used for gathering raw data in this particular case remain unspecified within the given context.
