The provided context does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that Halgamuge et al. (2020) collected data automatically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning technology. Additionally, the text discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to retrieve, map, and analyze images to extract information about spectral indices. It is also mentioned that some images had to be excluded due to inappropriate NDVI estimates, lack of such estimates, and cloud coverage. Based on this information, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline likely uses image data, specifically satellite imagery, to estimate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions in Australia.
