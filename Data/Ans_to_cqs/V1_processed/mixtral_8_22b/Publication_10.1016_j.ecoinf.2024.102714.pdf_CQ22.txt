Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which specific metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning (ML) model. However, we can infer some possible metrics based on common practices in ML model evaluation.

In general, when evaluating the performance of a supervised ML model like the one described here, several standard metrics are often employed. These include:

1. **Accuracy**: This measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of instances evaluated. It provides a simple and intuitive measure of overall performance but may not always be suitable for imbalanced datasets where certain classes have significantly fewer samples than others.

2. **Precision** (also known as Positive Predictive Value): Precision is defined as the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false positives. In other words, it measures how many of the predicted positive cases were actually positive. High precision indicates low false positive rate.

3. **Recall** (also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate): Recall is calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false negatives. Essentially, it quantifies what fraction of actual positives the model correctly identified. A higher recall value suggests better detection of positive cases.

4. **F1 Score**: F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a more balanced metric that considers both false positives and false negatives. An ideal classifier would achieve high values for both precision and recall, resulting in a high F1 score.

While the text does mention that high model accuracies were obtained for most of the target vegetation types (VTs), it does not specify whether this refers to overall accuracy or if any additional metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 scores were also considered during the evaluation process. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be definitively determined which exact metrics were utilized to assess the performance of the ML model.
