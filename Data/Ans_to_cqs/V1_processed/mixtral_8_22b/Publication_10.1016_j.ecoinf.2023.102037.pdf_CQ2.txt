The information provided does not explicitly state the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is implied that the input data consists of images due to references made to image datasets, such as the "Pest24" dataset containing 25,378 annotated images. Additionally, there are mentions of object detection, insect vs non-insect separation, and multi-class insect classification, which further suggest that the primary data format being utilized is images. Therefore, we can infer that the main data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
