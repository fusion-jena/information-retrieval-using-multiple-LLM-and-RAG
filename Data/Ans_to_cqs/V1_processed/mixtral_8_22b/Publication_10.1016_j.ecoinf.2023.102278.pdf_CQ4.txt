In this study, several data augmentation techniques were employed during the training phase of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques included image scaling, which involves resizing the images to different dimensions. Horizontal and vertical flipping were used to create new samples by mirroring the original images along their respective axes. Perspective distortion was another technique utilized, which manipulates the image's geometry to simulate changes in viewing angle or distance. Lastly, color jitter was introduced to modify the brightness, contrast, and saturation levels of the images, thereby creating additional variations within the dataset. All these techniques aimed to enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities by artificially expanding the available training data.
