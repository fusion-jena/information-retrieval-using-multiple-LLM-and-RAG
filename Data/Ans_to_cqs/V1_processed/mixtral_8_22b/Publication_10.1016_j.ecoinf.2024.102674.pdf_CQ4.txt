The papers mentioned do not provide explicit information about specific data augmentation techniques used in their respective deep learning pipelines. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting. It is likely that some form of these techniques was employed in the studies, but without explicit mention, it cannot be confirmed which ones were specifically used.
