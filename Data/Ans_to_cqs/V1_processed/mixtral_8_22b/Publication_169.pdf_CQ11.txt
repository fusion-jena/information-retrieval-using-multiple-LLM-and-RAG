The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, there is a reference to the UCI Machine Learning Repository where the dataset used in this work can be downloaded. Unfortunately, no specific link or identifier is provided for the dataset within the UCI Machine Learning Repository. To find the exact dataset, one would need to search for the "One-hundred plant species leaves data set" within the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
