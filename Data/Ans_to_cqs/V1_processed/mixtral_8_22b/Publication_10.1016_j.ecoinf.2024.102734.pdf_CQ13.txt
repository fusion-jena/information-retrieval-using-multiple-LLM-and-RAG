The text does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. It only mentions that the models were trained on a dataset containing 3000 5 s segments generated by the annotator and that the dataset was divided into an 80/20% training-validation split. Additionally, it states that the model hyperparameters were implemented based on the recommendation outlined by the model authors. However, it does not specify what those recommendations are or what the exact values of the hyperparameters used in the models are.
