The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that the authors have employed machine learning algorithms and potentially deep learning methods due to references to papers discussing applications of deep learning in ecology and a fast implementation of random forests for high-dimensional data.

One possible technique mentioned indirectly is image-based species identification using machine learning, which might involve object detection or classification tasks requiring appropriate data annotations like bounding boxes or class labels. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, one cannot provide a definitive answer.
