Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the research. However, it can be inferred from the use of both Random Forest (RF) and Maxent models that some form of validation was likely employed. Cross-validation is commonly used when training machine learning models like these, but without further details, it cannot be confirmed if this method was specifically utilized. Similarly, while diverse datasets would improve the robustness of any model, there is no direct evidence in the text indicating whether this was done. It should also be noted that stratified sampling could have been applied during the creation of the dataset, but again, this is speculative without additional information.
