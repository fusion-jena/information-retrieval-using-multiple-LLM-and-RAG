Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the task and the nature of the data. However, based on the given context, the only mentioned preprocessing step is image resizing. This step involves adjusting the dimensions of the input images to match the resolution required by the chosen models. Other commonly used preprocessing techniques include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization scales pixel intensities to a certain range, typically between 0 and 1, while maintaining the relationship between them. Scaling refers to changing the scale of the pixels without altering their relationships. Cleaning involves removing noise, irrelevant information, or outliers from the dataset to ensure better quality inputs for the model. These preprocessing steps help enhance the overall performance of the deep learning model during training and testing phases.
