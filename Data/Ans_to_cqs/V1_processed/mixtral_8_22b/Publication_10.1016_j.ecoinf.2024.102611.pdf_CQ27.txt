The given context does not provide information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Instead, it focuses on validating the practical deployment of a proposed hierarchical classification model as a smartphone-based application. This validation involves assessing the efficiency of the proposed model using two real-time datasets and comparing the machine predictions with those made by human experts. More than 50% conformity between expert and machine predictions was found, and 75.46% of the samples were accurately predicted using the baseline hierarchical classification model. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
