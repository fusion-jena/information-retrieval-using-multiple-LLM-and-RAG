Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training was minimizing the mean squared error. This approach is a common method used in machine learning models such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which seems to be the case here based on the mention of MLP model parameters in Table 2. However, there is no specific information about how exactly this strategy was implemented or any details regarding the training process itself. Additionally, it should be noted that the lack of temporal data might have affected the ability to fully evaluate the model's performance.
