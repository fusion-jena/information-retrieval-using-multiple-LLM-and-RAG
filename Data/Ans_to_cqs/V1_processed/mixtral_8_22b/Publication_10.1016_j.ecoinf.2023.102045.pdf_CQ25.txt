The text does not provide explicit information on the purpose of a deep learning model. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model could potentially be used for improving visual representations in mapping, particularly for individuals with color vision deficiencies. The article discusses the challenges faced by colorblind individuals when interpreting maps due to the reliance on color gradients. Therefore, one possible application of a deep learning model could be to enhance these visualizations, making them more accessible to those with color vision impairments. Nevertheless, without additional context, this remains speculative.
