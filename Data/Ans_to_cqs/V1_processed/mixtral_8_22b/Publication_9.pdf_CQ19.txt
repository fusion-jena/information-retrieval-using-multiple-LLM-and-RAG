The given context does not provide information about which specific frameworks were used to build the deep learning models mentioned. However, it mentions that methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Backpropagation have been employed in these models. These techniques are commonly implemented using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, but the exact choice of framework would depend on factors such as project requirements, developer preference, and available resources.
