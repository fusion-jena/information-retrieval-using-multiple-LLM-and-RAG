The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the context that the model might be used for either species or sex classification. This is because the authors mention using linear discriminant analysis to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane to classify species or sex. They also discuss evaluating the contribution of predictors on the response object, which could refer to identifying features that help distinguish between different species or sexes. Additionally, they mention extracting a set of base X,Y coordinates and 124 calculated variables consisting of lengths, angles, and areas for use in species or sex discrimination. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is likely being used for classification purposes, specifically for distinguishing between different species or sexes based on various extracted features.
