A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used in the pipeline. More specifically, it uses a framework that integrates two Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers. The model is designed to process three integrated features: the daily number of flights, the duration spent outside each day (measured in minutes), and the beeâ€™s age.
