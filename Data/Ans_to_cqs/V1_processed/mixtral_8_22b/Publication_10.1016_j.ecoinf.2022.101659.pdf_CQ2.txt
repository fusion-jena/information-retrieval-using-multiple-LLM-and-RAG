The information provided does not explicitly state what type of data format is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in the analysis is related to valve gaping, which is expressed as a proportion of aperture. The data is collected using sensors and recorded at 1 Hz. It is also mentioned that the data is processed using R programming language. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline could be a numerical or tabular format, possibly in CSV or similar format. Additionally, since the data is collected using sensors, it might also include time series data.
