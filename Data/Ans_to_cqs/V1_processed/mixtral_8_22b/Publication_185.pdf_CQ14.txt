Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. However, some details regarding certain hyperparameter values can be found. For instance, the batch size was set to 69, the momentum was set to 0.9, and the penalty multiplier for L2 weight decay was set to 5 Ã— 10^-4. Additionally, the dropout ratio was set to 0.5, and the model was trained in CPU mode. Unfortunately, without further context, we cannot determine if these hyperparameters were chosen through optimization techniques like grid search or random search.
