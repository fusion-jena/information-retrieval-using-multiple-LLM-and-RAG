The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is both classification and segmentation. The model, called MRS\_DeepLabV3+, integrates the classification results predicted by the DeepLabV3+ algorithm and the segmentation results obtained from MRS using Python programming language. The main goal of this approach is to classify and segment different categories within remote sensing images. This is achieved by counting the number of pixels of each category in the current segmentation object area, selecting the category with the largest area, and finally assigning the largest category to the current object.
