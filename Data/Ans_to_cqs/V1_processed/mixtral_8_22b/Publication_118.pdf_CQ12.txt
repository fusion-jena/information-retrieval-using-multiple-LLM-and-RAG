In the given context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically an auto-encoder variant. This can be determined from the description of the network architecture, which includes multiple convolutional layers and max-pooling or implicit pooling layers. These are characteristic features of CNN models. Furthermore, the use of ReLU activation functions also supports this conclusion, as they are commonly employed in CNNs.
