The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the early stopping strategy. This strategy inspects the validation accuracy after every epoch and stops the training process if it detects no further improvements. In this case, the maximum number of epochs for training was set to 100, but the training was completed before reaching that limit due to the early stopping strategy. Additionally, the initial learning rate was set to 1 x 10^-6 and was randomly decreased to 10^-6 by monitoring the validation loss after every epoch.
