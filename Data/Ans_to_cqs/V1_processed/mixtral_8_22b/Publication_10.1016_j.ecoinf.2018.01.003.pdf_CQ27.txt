The given context does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the experimental process map is randomly selected in Matlab (Fig. 6). This suggests that the experiment might have been carried out within the Matlab environment itself. Unfortunately, there is no further information regarding model serialization or platform selection for deployment.
