Based on the given information, it appears that the model underwent 150 iterations during its training phase. This suggests that one criterion used to determine when training is complete could be reaching a predefined number of iterations or epochs. However, the text does not explicitly mention other specific criteria such as validation loss plateau, so we cannot definitively state whether these were also used. It's important to note that different models may use different criteria to determine when training is complete, depending on their specific requirements and objectives. Some common criteria include achieving a certain level of accuracy, minimizing the validation loss, or reaching a point where additional training no longer improves the model's performance. Without more detailed information about the specific model and its training process, it's difficult to provide a more precise answer.
