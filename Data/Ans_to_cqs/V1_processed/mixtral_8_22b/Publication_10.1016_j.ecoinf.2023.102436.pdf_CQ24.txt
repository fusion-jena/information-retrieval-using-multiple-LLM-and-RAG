None of the provided sources directly address handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, common practices in machine learning and deep learning include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation to reduce overfitting caused by random initializations, and employing ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different random seeds. These approaches help mitigate the effects of randomness and improve model robustness.
