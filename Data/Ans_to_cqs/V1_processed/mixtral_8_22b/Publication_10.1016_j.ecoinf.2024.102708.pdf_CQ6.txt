The text does not provide explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning models. However, common practices in preparing datasets for deep learning include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so they have zero mean and unit variance. Scaling adjusts the range of pixel values to improve contrast or brightness. Cleaning removes noise, irrelevant data, or outliers that might negatively impact the performance of the model. These techniques help ensure that the dataset is suitable for training deep learning models effectively.
