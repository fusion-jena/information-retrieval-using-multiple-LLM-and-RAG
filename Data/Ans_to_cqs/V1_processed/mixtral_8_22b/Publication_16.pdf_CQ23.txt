To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included various bird species such as the Eurasian Collared Dove and the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker. This diversity in the dataset allowed the model to learn patterns across different types of birds, improving its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Secondly, the model employed dropout layers to aid in regularization and prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single feature or pattern. By incorporating dropout layers into the architecture, the model could better generalize to new data by reducing its dependence on specific features present only in the training set.

Lastly, the model underwent training over 100 epochs, allowing it to gradually converge without becoming excessively specialized to the training data. As seen in Figure 9, the loss of the model continued to decrease throughout the specified epochs, indicating ongoing improvements in the model's performance. Furthermore, Figure 10 demonstrates that the accuracy of the model plateaued towards the end of the training session, suggesting that the chosen number of epochs was sufficient for model convergence and avoiding overfitting.

In conclusion, the combination of a diverse dataset, dropout layers for regularization, and careful selection of the number of epochs contributed to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model. These measures collectively enabled the model to perform well not only on the training data but also on previously unseen data, as evidenced by the test split accuracy of 0.74.
