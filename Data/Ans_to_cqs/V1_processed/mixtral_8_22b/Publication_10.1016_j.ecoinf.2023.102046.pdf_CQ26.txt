To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. One such technique is stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. This ensures that both sets have similar representations of each class, reducing any potential biases caused by uneven distributions.

Another method to tackle data bias is through oversampling or undersampling. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from underrepresented classes to balance the dataset, while undersampling removes samples from overrepresented classes. Both methods help create a more balanced dataset, improving the overall performance of the deep learning model.

Additionally, diverse data collection plays a crucial role in addressing data bias. By collecting data from various sources and ensuring diversity among samples, the risk of having a skewed dataset is minimized. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards certain characteristics present in the majority of the collected data.

In the given context, the issue of dataset imbalance was dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function. Class weights assign higher importance to minority classes, helping the model learn better from these classes and reducing the impact of dominant classes on the final predictions.
