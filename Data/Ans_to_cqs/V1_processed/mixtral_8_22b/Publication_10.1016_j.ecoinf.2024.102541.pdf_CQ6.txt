Before training a deep learning model such as YOLOv5s, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific requirements of the dataset and task. These can include data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, or cropping to increase the diversity of the training set. Normalization methods such as mean subtraction, scaling, or batch normalization can also be applied to ensure consistent feature scales across different dimensions. Data cleaning processes might involve removing corrupted samples, handling missing values, or dealing with class imbalance issues. Additionally, label encoding or one-hot encoding could be necessary when working with categorical variables. However, it should be noted that not all these preprocessing steps are mandatory, and their application depends on the nature of the problem and the chosen architecture. For instance, YOLOv5s already incorporates batch normalization within its core unit, as mentioned in the given context. Therefore, additional normalization steps might not always be required.
