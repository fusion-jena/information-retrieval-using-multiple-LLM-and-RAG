The given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training deep learning models, such as GPUs or TPUs. It primarily focuses on describing various machine learning algorithms like neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines, along with their application in supervised learning of animal behavior based on accelerometer data. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hardware resources were utilized for training these models based solely on this context.
