The text does not provide any information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses various aspects related to the use of machine learning tools for refining classifications, the limitations of these tools, and the need for further testing. However, no specific details regarding the location of the code repository are mentioned. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on this given context.
