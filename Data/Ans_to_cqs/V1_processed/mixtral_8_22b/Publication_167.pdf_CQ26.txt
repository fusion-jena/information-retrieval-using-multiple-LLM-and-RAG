To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques are employed. One technique mentioned in the given context is batch normalization, which is applied to the input data. This involves calculating the mean and variance of each channel in the current batch, subtracting the mean from the input, dividing the result by the standard deviation, and obtaining the normalized output. Then, the normalized output is scaled by a factor gamma and shifted by beta to get the final output.

Additionally, the issue of class imbalance in the categorical data is addressed by assigning larger weights to classes with fewer samples and smaller weights to those with more samples during the training process. This helps improve the model's performance for classes with small sample sizes.

However, other common techniques for addressing data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. These methods could also potentially be useful depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the nature of the biases present.
