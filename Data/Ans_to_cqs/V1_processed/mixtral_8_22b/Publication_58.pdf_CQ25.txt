The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the given context is for land use (LU) detection and classification. Specifically, these models are used for both single-pixel and semantic labeling tasks. The goal is to accurately identify and categorize various land uses within satellite images. The best performing'single-pixel' architecture is DenseNet, while the best'semantic labeling' network is DeepLab. These models have proven to significantly outperform the XGBoost model, with differences being significant, reaching up to 15 percent points in overall accuracy (OA). It should be noted that the internal parameters of the employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were not changed with regards to the originally proposed ones.
