The text does not provide specific information about the name or type of the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the dataset consists of audio spectrograms constrained to 128 x 128 pixel RGB images with values repeated in each color channel to produce a grayscale image. Additionally, the dataset has been extensively annotated and used in previous studies. Therefore, while the exact name or type of the dataset is unknown, it can be inferred that it contains audio data represented as grayscale images and has been previously utilized in research.
