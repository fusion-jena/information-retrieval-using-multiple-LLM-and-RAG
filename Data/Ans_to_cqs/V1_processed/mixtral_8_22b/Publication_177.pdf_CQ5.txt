Two datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline: UBD\_45 and VP\_200. These datasets were used to train and test various deep learning models, including InceptionResnet2, Resnet50, Xception, Inceptionv3, Mobilenetv2, and Googlenet. The performance metrics for these models on both datasets are presented in Tables I and II. The highest testing accuracy was achieved using the InceptionResNetV2 network on the UBD\_45 dataset, while the maximum testing accuracy on the VP\_200 dataset was obtained using the Xception net. It should be noted that the validation and testing accuracies for the VP\_200 dataset were comparatively lower than those for the UBD\_45 dataset, despite having more balanced data and a larger number of samples. This could potentially be due to the presence of a large number of classes and the nature of images in the dataset.
