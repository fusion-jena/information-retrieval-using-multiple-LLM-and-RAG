The papers cited in this context primarily focus on deep learning applications related to computer vision tasks such as object detection, plant disease classification, animal identification, and satellite imagery analysis. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in these deep learning pipelines is images or video frames. For instance, Lin et al. (2014) introduce the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset containing thousands of labeled images for object detection tasks. Similarly, Schindler and Steinhage (2021) use deep learning techniques for identifying animals and recognizing their actions in wildlife videos. Furthermore, Sandler et al. (2018) propose MobileNetV2, which is designed for mobile devices and optimized for image classification tasks.

However, there are also instances where other data formats are utilized. For example, Anders et al. (2021) employ convolutional recurrent neural networks for acoustic chimpanzee detection, indicating the use of audio data in their deep learning pipeline. Additionally, Antoine-Santoni et al. (2018) present a wireless tracking and sensor system called AMBLoRa, which uses long-range communication to monitor animal behavior. While not explicitly mentioned, this could potentially involve various types of sensor data, including but not limited to GPS coordinates, temperature readings, or accelerometer measurements.

In summary, the majority of the research presented here focuses on computer vision tasks utilizing image or video frame data formats. However, there are examples of deep learning pipelines incorporating different data formats like audio and possibly other sensor data.
