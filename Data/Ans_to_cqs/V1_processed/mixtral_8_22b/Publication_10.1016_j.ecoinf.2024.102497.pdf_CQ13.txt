The given context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning model. The papers mentioned in the context discuss various aspects related to bathymetry retrieval methods, such as linear or nonlinear regression, logarithmic ratio transformation, and machine learning techniques like CART, RFR, and SVM. They also mention the use of different sensors and satellite imagery for estimating bathymetry. However, none of them explicitly state the hyperparameters used in their respective deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in these models based solely on this context.
