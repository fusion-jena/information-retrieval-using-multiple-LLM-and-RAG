The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for tasks like image segmentation, image classification, and object detection. Some popular methods include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within an image to identify them. It is commonly used for object localization and detection tasks.

2. Semantic Segmentation: This method assigns a label or category to every pixel in an image, allowing for precise identification of different regions or objects within the image.

3. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, this approach also labels individual pixels; however, it distinguishes between instances of the same class, making it useful for identifying multiple occurrences of similar objects.

4. Polygon Annotation: This technique uses polygons instead of rectangles to outline complex shapes more accurately. It is often employed when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark Annotation: Also known as key point annotation, this method identifies specific points on an object, which can help determine its size, position, orientation, or pose.

Without explicit mention in the provided context, it cannot be confirmed which specific data annotation techniques were utilized in the described deep learning pipeline.
