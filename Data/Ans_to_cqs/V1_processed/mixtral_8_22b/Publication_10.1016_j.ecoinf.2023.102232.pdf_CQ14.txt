In the given context, it appears that the optimization of the model parameters is performed through a combination of Least Squares (LS) methods and Genetic Algorithms (GA). However, there is no explicit mention of specific hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Instead, the focus seems to be on finding the optimal set of parameter values rather than tuning hyperparameters.

The LS method is used to find the best fit parameter values, which are then fed into the GA for partial optimization and exploration of the parameter space. From the description, it appears that the top quarter of the best fit parameter values from the LS method are used as inputs for the GA. During the GA process, new combinations of best fit values are generated and stored in the database along with previous estimates. At the end of a GA cycle, the rows of the database are reordered based on the sum of the residuals.

While not explicitly stated, one could infer that the choice of hyperparameters for the LS and GA processes might have been determined through some form of trial and error or manual tuning, rather than systematic approaches like grid search or random search. Nonetheless, without more information about how these choices were made, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the use of specific hyperparameter optimization techniques.
