The context provided does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the given study or method. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, or other performance indicators during training. When these metrics reach a plateau or stop improving significantly, it may indicate that further training will not yield substantial improvements, suggesting that training could be considered complete. It is also possible to use early stopping techniques, where training is halted if the monitored metric stops improving after a certain number of epochs. Without explicit information regarding the criteria used in this particular case, we can only infer based on general machine learning practices.
