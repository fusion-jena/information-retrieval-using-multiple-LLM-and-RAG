The given context does not provide information on any specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). The text discusses pre-processing steps for imagery, including calculating a per-pixel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) layer, and segmentation and classification methods for different types of images. However, it does not mention any details about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques used within them.
