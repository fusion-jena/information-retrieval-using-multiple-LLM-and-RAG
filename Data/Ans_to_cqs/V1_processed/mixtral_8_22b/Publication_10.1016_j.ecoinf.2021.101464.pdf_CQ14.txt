The hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model in this case are optimized using an alternate method called successive screening. This method attempts to find the optimal number of variables (M) to be tried at each split. The optimal value of M is determined by looking below and above a certain threshold, which is typically one-third of the total number of variables for regression. The goal is to find the value of M that results in the minimum Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error rate. Unlike other methods such as grid search or random search, successive screening does not rely on predefined ranges or random sampling of hyperparameter values. Instead, it systematically screens different values of M until the optimal value is found.
