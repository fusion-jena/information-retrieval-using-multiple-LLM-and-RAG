The dataset for each period was divided into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 70:20:10, respectively. This means that 70% of the data was used for training the deep learning models, while 20% was used for testing and 10% for validation purposes. These ratios are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning applications to ensure that the models can learn effectively from the data without overfitting or underfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts fitting noise instead of actual patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. Underfitting happens when the model is not complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in low accuracy even on the training set. By splitting the data into separate subsets for training, testing, and validation, we can evaluate the model's performance objectively and fine-tune it accordingly.
