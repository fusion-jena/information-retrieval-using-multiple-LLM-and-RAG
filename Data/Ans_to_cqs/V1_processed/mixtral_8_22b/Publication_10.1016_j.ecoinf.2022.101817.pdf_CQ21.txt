After the model training, there are several post-processing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project. Some common post-processing steps include:

1. Saliency Maps: These visualize which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions. They help identify areas where the model may have focused its attention during prediction.

2. Metrics Calculation: This involves calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

3. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class.

Based on the given context, it appears that one of the post-processing steps performed was creating a confusion matrix to validate the performance of the CNN Model 4 with respect to each of the six environmental conditions. However, without additional information, we cannot determine if any other post-processing steps were taken or what their results were.
