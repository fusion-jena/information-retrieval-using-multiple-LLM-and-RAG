In the given context, there are several datasets mentioned that were used in various deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Caltech Camera Trap Dataset: This dataset consists of 243,100 images. It has been used in conjunction with TensorFlow Lite InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNetB1, DenseNet121, and Xception pre-trained on ImageNet neural network models.

2. Snapshot Serengeti: This dataset contains 78,000 images. It has been used with MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and EfficientNetB3 models.

3. African Elephant (Loxodonta Africana) Dataset: Although not explicitly stated, this dataset appears to be part of the research conducted by Whytock et al. (2023) and SwieË™zewski et al. (2021).

4. Multiple Datasets: These unnamed datasets have been used in species distribution modeling, which involves understanding the relationship between species occurrence data and environmental data.

5. Passive Acoustic Monitoring: While not directly related to visual datasets like those above, passive acoustic monitoring involves analyzing audio recordings to identify different animal species. This method has been used with twelve pre-trained models.

It should be noted that these datasets vary significantly in their content and purpose. Some focus specifically on certain species or environments, while others cover broader categories. Additionally, each dataset may require specific preprocessing steps before being suitable for use in a deep learning pipeline.
