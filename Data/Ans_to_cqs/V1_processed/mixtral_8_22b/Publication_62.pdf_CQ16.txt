The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. In this study, the authors might have employed similar strategies, but without further details, we cannot confirm which specific criterion they used.
