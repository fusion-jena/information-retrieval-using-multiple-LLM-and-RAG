The given context does not directly address the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses several techniques related to handling variability and improving stability in machine learning models, including ensemble methods like random forests, bagging, and boosting. These methods involve combining multiple models or predictions to reduce variance and improve overall performance.

In the case of random forests, decision trees are combined into an ensemble to create a more robust model. Bagging involves creating multiple instances of a model with different subsets of training data and then aggregating their outputs. Boosting, on the other hand, sequentially trains weak learners to focus on misclassified examples, gradually building a strong learner.

To prevent overfitting in XGBoost, a type of boosting algorithm, a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme is employed. This involves splitting datasets into tuning, validation, and test sets, and monitoring performance on the validation set while adjusting the number of iterations.

Although these techniques do not explicitly manage randomness caused by factors like random seed values, they contribute to reducing variability and enhancing the stability of machine learning models. Managing randomness in deep learning pipelines often involves setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like dropout for regularization, and utilizing ensemble methods to mitigate the effects of random initialization and stochastic processes during training.
