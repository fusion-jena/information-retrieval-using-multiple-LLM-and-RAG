The information provided does not contain any details about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on inter- and intra-brand recordings using different devices (SongMeter and AudioMoth), sample schemes, frequencies, and gain settings. The goal appears to be minimizing device bias for broader comparative analyses and potential applications in machine learning and deep learning. However, no explicit mention of any particular dataset was made.
