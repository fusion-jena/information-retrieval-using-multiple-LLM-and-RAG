The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the context provided, it appears that the primary goal of the study is to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. To achieve this, the researchers employed seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), among others. These models were used to extract Area Under the Curve (AUC) values both before and after urban development.

While these models may involve elements of classification or regression, they do not appear to be specifically designed for image segmentation or object detection tasks. Instead, they seem to focus on predicting species distributions based on various environmental variables such as land cover, vegetation, terrain, and distance to certain features like water bodies, forests, roads, and urban areas.

Therefore, the purpose of these deep learning models could be described as performing spatial predictions or species distribution modeling rather than traditional computer vision tasks like image classification, segmentation, or object detection.
