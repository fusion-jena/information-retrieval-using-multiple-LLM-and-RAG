The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in any deep learning pipelines. However, it mentions several studies using deep learning algorithms for various purposes like strategic planning, assessing the role of settlement in environmental challenges, analyzing the effects of topography, climate, and human activities on the spatial pattern of kNDVI, etc. These studies might be using different types of datasets depending upon their objectives and requirements. Some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, COCO, etc., but without more specific details, we cannot determine which dataset was used in these studies.
