The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for classification purposes. This is evident from the title of one of the cited papers, which mentions 'deep learning based classification'. Additionally, another paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques like random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion techniques, and neural networks for establishing Above Ground Biomass (AGB) equations. These techniques are often employed for classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model discussed here is likely being used for classification purposes.
