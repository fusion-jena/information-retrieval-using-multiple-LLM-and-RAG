Data bias is a significant issue in machine learning and deep learning pipelines, which can lead to poor model performance if not addressed properly. Several techniques are commonly employed to mitigate data bias during preprocessing. Here are some popular ones:

1. Stratified Sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, such as target classes or features, before splitting it into training and testing sets. The goal is to ensure that each subset maintains the same proportion of samples from different groups as the original dataset. This helps prevent any group from being underrepresented or overrepresented in either set.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class has significantly fewer instances compared to others, oversampling can help balance the dataset. It involves duplicating existing minority class examples or generating synthetic samples using algorithms like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). By increasing the number of minority class instances, this method aims to reduce the impact of imbalanced datasets on model performance.

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, undersampling reduces the majority class size to match the minority class count. Randomly removing samples from the majority class is one way to achieve this. However, this approach may discard valuable information. Alternatively, techniques like NearMiss or Tomek Links can selectively remove majority class instances close to the decision boundary, preserving important patterns within the dataset.

4. Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse data is crucial for building robust models capable of handling various scenarios. Ensuring representation from all possible sources, demographics, or conditions relevant to the problem domain can minimize biases introduced by limited or skewed datasets. Regularly updating and expanding the dataset with new samples also contributes to maintaining model accuracy over time.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing involves employing techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse data. These strategies aim to create balanced and representative datasets, ultimately improving deep learning model performance and reliability.
