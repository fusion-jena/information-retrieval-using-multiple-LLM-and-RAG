The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model such as learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions the use of a larger FFT window size and fitting cow-specific parameters in the model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a helpful answer regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
