The text does not provide information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. The focus of the given excerpt is on the use of various machine learning models, including deep learning, for river health prediction and the evaluation of their generalizability using bias-variance decomposition. However, it does not discuss the deployment process or any details related to model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, based on the available information, I cannot provide a helpful response regarding the deployment process of the trained deep learning model.
