Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the papers. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the exact datasets used in these studies. However, I can mention that common datasets used in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, among others. These datasets are often employed for various computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.
