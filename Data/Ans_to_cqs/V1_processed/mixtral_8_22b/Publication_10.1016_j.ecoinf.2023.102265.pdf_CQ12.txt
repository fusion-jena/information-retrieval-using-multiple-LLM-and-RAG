The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model called ResNet-50. This model was chosen due to its marginally higher validation accuracy compared to other depths like ResNet-18 and ResNet-101. ResNet-50 consists of five convolutional blocks stacked on top of one another. It extracts image features from fully connected layers pre-trained with the ImageNet database. The input to the network is an image of size 224x224 pixels.
