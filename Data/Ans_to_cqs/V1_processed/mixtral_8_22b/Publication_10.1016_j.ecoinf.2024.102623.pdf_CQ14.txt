The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, based on the given data, it appears that the hyperparameter λ2 was tested using various values ranging from 2 to 2048. It is possible that either a grid search or a manual search method was used to find the optimal λ2 value for each region. Grid search involves testing all combinations of a manually specified subset of a hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm, while manual search involves trying different values one at a time until satisfactory results are achieved. Without further information, it cannot be determined which specific optimization technique was employed.
