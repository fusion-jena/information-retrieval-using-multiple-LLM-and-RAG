The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used by L. Martinez-Sanchez et al. in Ecological Informatics 70(2022)10175716 can be found at https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf. This repository contains an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ using the COCO dataset, which includes 121,408 images and a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. The authors did not train the model directly on the landscape photos but instead used it to infer common objects below the skyline.
