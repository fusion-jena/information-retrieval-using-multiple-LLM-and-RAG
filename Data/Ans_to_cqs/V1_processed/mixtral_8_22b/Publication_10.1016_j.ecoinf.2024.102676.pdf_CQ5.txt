The query asks about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, the provided information does not explicitly mention any particular dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct answer based solely on the given context.

However, the context mentions a study using deep learning models to classify three sympatric otter species where a model trained on images of all qualities was compared to a model trained on high-quality prints. It can be inferred that the datasets used in this study likely consisted of images of otter footprints, but no specific details regarding the source or nature of these datasets were provided.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of missing value imputation as part of the data preprocessing pipeline for enhancing the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method. While this suggests that the datasets may have contained missing values, there is still no explicit mention of any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, without more specific information regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it is not possible to definitively identify them.
