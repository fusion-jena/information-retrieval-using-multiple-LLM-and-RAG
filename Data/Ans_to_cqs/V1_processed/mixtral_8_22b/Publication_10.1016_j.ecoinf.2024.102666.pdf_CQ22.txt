Based on the given context, two metrics are mentioned for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are used to compare and rank the performance of different algorithms. However, it should be noted that these metrics are not specific to deep learning models only but can also be applied to other types of predictive models.

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the difference between the predicted and actual values, where lower values indicate better fit. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE), on the other hand, calculates the average of the absolute errors between the predicted and actual values. Lower values of MAE indicate better performance of the model.

These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in terms of prediction accuracy and help in selecting the most suitable algorithm or model for a particular task.
