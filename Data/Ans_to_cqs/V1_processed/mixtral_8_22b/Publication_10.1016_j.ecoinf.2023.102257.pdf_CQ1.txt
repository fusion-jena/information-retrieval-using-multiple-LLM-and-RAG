The article discusses the use of trail cameras or camera traps for wildlife monitoring as part of a deep learning pipeline. Camera traps are remote, motion-activated devices that capture images or videos of animals in their natural habitats. The collected data is then labeled manually by human experts, which can be a time-consuming task. To improve this process, machine learning models such as bounding box algorithms have been developed to assist in data labeling. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in improving tagging efficiency while considering factors like model performance and potential errors. Other relevant studies mentioned in the materials and methods section also focus on utilizing camera trap images for various purposes, such as detecting and classifying ungulates, identifying empty images in camera-trap data, and comparing deep learning techniques with citizen science approaches for counting wildlife in aerial survey images.
