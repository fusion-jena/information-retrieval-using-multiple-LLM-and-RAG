After the neural network training and validation process, several postprocessing steps were taken to generate predictions and analyze the model's performance. These steps include generating a prediction record, collecting weather data, and evaluating the model using various metrics.

First, predictions for the entire unvalidated recording period were generated. For each of the five training folds, a single prediction was made for every 8-second interval throughout the year. The resulting five prediction records were then averaged together to create a single prediction record. To provide a more concise summary of the data, these 8-second interval predictions were aggregated into hourly prediction records, indicating the number of instances each specific sound stimulus was predicted per hour. This record was normalized by the number of 8-second intervals actually recorded during that hour to account for missing audio data.

Next, weather data was collected to complement the acoustic data analysis. Although no details about the collection method or type of weather data gathered are mentioned, it can be assumed that this information was integrated into the study to examine any potential correlations between environmental conditions and sound events.

Finally, the model's performance was evaluated using various metrics. The average unweighted and category-weighted training classification accuracies were found to be 98.9% and 97.4%, respectively. However, slightly lower testing accuracy scores were observed in certain categories due to factors such as faint sounds, class ambiguity, and small sample sizes. The F1-scores for the training and testing datasets were.980 and.907, respectively. Besides the conventional accuracy metric, the area under the curve was also calculated using a Riemann sum. It should be noted that the training and validation loss/accuracy were compared after each epoch, and a separate dataset was reserved for performance testing after all training had ceased. All reported results represent the average after five-fold cross-validation.
