Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, during the network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance the network's robustness. Additionally, the initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the learning rate was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. These details suggest that some level of optimization or tuning may have been performed, but without specific mention of methods like grid search or random search, we cannot definitively determine the exact method used for hyperparameter optimization.
