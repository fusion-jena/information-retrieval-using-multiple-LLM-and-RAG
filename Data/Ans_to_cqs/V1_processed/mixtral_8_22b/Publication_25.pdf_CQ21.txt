The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, etc. However, it does discuss various aspects related to improving the model performance through different methods like using better validation data, more hand-annotated training samples, combining self-supervised learning with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework, and comparing the contributions of high-quality annotations versus self-supervised models.

The Figure 8 shows how the prediction quality improves during the training pipeline, starting from bounding boxes generated by lidar-based unsupervised detection, then predictions from the self-supervised RGB model, and finally the full semi-supervised model combining both self-supervised RGB data and hand-annotations. Although this process doesn't directly address the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query, it provides insights into the iterative improvement of the model's predictive capabilities throughout its development.
