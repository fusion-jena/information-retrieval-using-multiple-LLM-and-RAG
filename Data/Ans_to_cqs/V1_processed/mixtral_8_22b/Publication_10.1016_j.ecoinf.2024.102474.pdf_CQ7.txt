According to the given context, the data is divided into a set used for model training and four distinct sets for testing. This division is defined by EarthNet2021, but the specific criteria used to split the data are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the splitting process aims to create separate datasets for different stages of the machine learning pipeline, such as training, validation, and testing. These splits help ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and prevent overfitting during training.
