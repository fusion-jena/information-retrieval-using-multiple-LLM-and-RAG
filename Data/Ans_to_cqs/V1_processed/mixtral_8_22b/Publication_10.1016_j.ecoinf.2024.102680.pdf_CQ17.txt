The authors do not explicitly mention any regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization in the given text. However, they discuss two strategies to overcome issues related to overwhelming computational complexity and overfitting. First, they use dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations and maintain a larger receptive field without increasing the number of parameters or computational load. Second, they employ Boosting R-CNN, which uses a reweighting strategy to adjust the classification loss based on errors in the region proposal network. This method helps address challenges specific to underwater environments but requires significant computational resources. Although these strategies help improve model performance and efficiency, they do not directly correspond to traditional regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.
