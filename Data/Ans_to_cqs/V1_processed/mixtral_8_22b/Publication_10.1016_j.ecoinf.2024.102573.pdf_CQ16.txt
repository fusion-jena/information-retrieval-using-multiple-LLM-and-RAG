Training completion is determined based on the macro-averaged f1-score on the validation set. This score helps monitor the model convergence. The models were trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer with default hyper-parameters and a cosine decay scheduler for the learning rate. The loss function used was cross-entropy for multi-class single-label classification. Macro averaging ensures that all classes receive equal importance, regardless of the number of data points in each class.
