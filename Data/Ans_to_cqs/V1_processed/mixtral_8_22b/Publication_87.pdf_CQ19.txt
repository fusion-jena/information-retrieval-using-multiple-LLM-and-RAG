The deep learning model is built using PyTorch, which is an open source machine learning library based on Torch. This can be seen from the reference to the paper titled "PyTorch: An Imperative Style, High-Performance Deep Learning Library" published in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32. Additionally, the code snippet uses the `resnet18()` function, which is part of the torchvision package, a computer vision library for PyTorch.
