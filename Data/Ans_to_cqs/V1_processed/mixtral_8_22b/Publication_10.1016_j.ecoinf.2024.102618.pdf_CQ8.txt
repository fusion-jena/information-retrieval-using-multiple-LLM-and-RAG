The paper does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses the use of various deep learning models such as EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, InceptionResNetv2, ResNet50v2, and DenseNet201 for plant disease classification. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the code repository is located based solely on the given context.
