The given context does not provide specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets for various tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, etc. For example, bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest, while semantic segmentation requires pixel-level labeling of each object class. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image. Polygon annotation involves outlining the shape of objects using vertices, while key point annotation marks specific points or joints on objects. Landmark annotation identifies important features or reference points on objects. Without more specific details about the datasets and methods used in the given context, it is impossible to determine which annotation techniques were employed.
