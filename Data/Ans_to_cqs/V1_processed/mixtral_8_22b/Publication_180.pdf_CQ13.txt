The text mentions that the authors adjusted two parameters from their default values in TensorFlow: validation percentage and number of training steps. They increased the validation percentage from 10% to 16% due to small numbers of images available for some species. For the number of training steps, they explored different numbers and compared the results to find the optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. However, the text does not provide specific information on other hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer.
