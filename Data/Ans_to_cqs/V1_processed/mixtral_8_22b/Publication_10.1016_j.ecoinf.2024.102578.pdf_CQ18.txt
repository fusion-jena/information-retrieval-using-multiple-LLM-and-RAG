Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer from Table 4 that the authors used various performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score to evaluate their models. These metrics could have been monitored during the training process to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, Table 5 and Table 7 showcase the performance of the image quality model and false positive model respectively on the test data using these same metrics. This suggests that the authors did indeed track these metrics throughout the development and testing phases of their models.
