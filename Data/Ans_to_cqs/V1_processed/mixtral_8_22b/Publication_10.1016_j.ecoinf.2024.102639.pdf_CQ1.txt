The paper does not provide information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, common methods include using sensors, conducting surveys, or utilizing publicly available datasets. In this case, we cannot determine which method was employed without further context.

Based on the given context, it is not possible to directly answer the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general methods for gathering such data include using sensors, conducting surveys, or employing publicly available datasets. Without additional context, we cannot definitively state which method was used in this particular study.
