The given context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of training samples available for a machine learning task by creating modified versions of images in the dataset using random transformations that yield believable-looking images. Commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shearing. However, without explicit mention or reference to these methods within the provided context, it cannot be determined which, if any, were utilized in this particular research.
