The context does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common machine learning practices, some possible postprocessing steps could include evaluating the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score, creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps to understand the importance of different features, and performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model. These steps can help assess the quality of the model and identify areas for improvement.

The given context mentions the use of a stacked GRU-DNN model and provides details about its hyperparameter tuning process. It also discusses techniques like early stopping and dropout to prevent overfitting during training. However, it does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps taken after the model training phase. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state what postprocessing steps were involved in this particular case, we can suggest potential steps based on typical machine learning workflows.
