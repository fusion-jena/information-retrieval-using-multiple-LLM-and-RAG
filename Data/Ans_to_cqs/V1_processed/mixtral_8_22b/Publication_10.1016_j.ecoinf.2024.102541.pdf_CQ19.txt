Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of which specific framework was used to build the deep learning models such as YOLOv5s or WildARe-YOLO. However, it can be inferred that popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch could have been used due to their widespread adoption in building and deploying deep learning models. It would require additional resources or documentation to confirm the exact framework used.
