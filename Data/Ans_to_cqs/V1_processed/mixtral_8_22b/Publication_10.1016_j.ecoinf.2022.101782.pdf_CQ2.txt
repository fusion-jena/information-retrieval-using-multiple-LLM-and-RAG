The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data format. The input tensors are 224 x 244 pixel RGB images, which are normalized to ImageNet mean values and have pixel values rescaled in the range of [0, 1]. The model training takes roughly four days, and the best model is selected based on minimum validation loss. The model shows a training loss of 0.256, a training accuracy of 0.899, a validation loss of 0.298, and a validation accuracy of 0.891. The performance of the red kite model is evaluated based on an independent test set of 2060 images. Out of these images, 950 are true positive red kites images.
