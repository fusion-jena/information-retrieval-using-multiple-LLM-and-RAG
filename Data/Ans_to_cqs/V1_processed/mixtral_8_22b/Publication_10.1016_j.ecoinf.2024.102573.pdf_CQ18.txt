To monitor the model performance during training, the first five seconds of the validation recordings were used. This strategy was effective because the labeled species are typically present during the initial few seconds of the recordings from Xeno-Canto. Preliminary experiments confirmed that this approach significantly reduces computation time while still yielding valid results when compared to the full-length evaluation employed for the test set.
