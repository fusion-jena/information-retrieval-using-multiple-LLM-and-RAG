Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions that the initial LULC classification was done using Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud processing platform that enables high-performance and rapid planetary-scale processing and analysis of images. This suggests that the computational workload might have been handled by GEE's infrastructure, but no explicit details regarding the use of GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware resources are mentioned.
