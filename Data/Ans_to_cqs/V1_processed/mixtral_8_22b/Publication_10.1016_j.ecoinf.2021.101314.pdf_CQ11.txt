Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the deep learning pipeline's data repository. However, based on the given context, I can suggest checking out the TNC GIS Data website (<http://maps.tnc.org/gis_data.html>) mentioned in the reference [8]. While it might not contain the specific deep learning pipeline data, it could potentially offer related datasets or resources relevant to ecology and conservation efforts.
