The text does not provide information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adjusting brightness or contrast. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of the dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting.
