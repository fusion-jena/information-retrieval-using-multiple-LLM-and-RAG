The given context does not provide specific information on the type of deep learning models used in the mentioned studies. However, it can be inferred from the context that various types of deep learning models have been applied in ecology, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for species identification through imagery and possibly other architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for tasks related to species distribution, characterization of land use change, biodiversity conservation, and estimation, among others. To find out the exact type of deep learning model used in each case, one would need to refer to the respective research papers cited in the text.
