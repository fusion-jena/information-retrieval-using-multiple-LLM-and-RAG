Strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting a fixed random seed value, using deterministic algorithms, and employing techniques such as cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce variability caused by random sampling. Additionally, ensemble methods can be used to combine multiple models trained with different initializations to improve overall performance and robustness.
