The papers mentioned primarily focus on remote sensing applications, specifically using satellite or airborne data such as LIDAR, SAR, and multispectral imagery. Therefore, the primary data format used in these studies is raster data, which includes satellite or airborne images. These images may be in various formats like GeoTIFF, JPEG, or other common image file types. Some studies also use vector data, such as shapefiles or CSV files containing point locations or polygon boundaries. However, none of the papers explicitly mention using audio or video data formats within their deep learning pipelines.
