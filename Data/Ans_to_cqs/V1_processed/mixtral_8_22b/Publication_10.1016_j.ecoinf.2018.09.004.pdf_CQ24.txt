The query asks about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, the provided context does not directly discuss deep learning or managing randomness within its pipeline. Instead, it focuses on applying machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, to examine the presence-absence of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean Sea.

That said, there are general strategies to manage randomness in machine learning pipelines that could be applied to deep learning as well. These include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using cross-validation to reduce variance due to random sampling, and employing ensembling methods like bagging or boosting to improve model performance and stability.

Regarding the specific issue of random seed values, they can significantly impact the initialization of weights in neural networks and the selection of training samples during stochastic gradient descent. To ensure consistency and reproducibility across different runs, researchers often set a fixed seed value at the beginning of their code. This way, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code is executed, leading to consistent results.
