The given context does not provide specific information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a method used to divide the dataset into different subsets or strata before selecting samples from each subset. This ensures that all classes are represented proportionally in both the training and validation datasets.

Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance the dataset. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing examples from the majority class to achieve the same goal. Both techniques aim to reduce the impact of imbalanced datasets on machine learning models.

Diverse data collection refers to collecting data from various sources and perspectives to increase the diversity of the dataset. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the performance of the model by reducing its reliance on any particular feature or pattern.

In summary, there are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, including stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques help improve the accuracy and fairness of machine learning models by ensuring that all classes are represented equally and preventing overfitting.
