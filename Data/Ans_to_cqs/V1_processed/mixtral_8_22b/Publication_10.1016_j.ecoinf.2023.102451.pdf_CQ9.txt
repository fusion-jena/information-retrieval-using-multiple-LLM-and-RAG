Unfortunately, based on the provided information, there isn't any explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the dataset used is a publicly available dataset called EMDS-6, but it does not specify where exactly this dataset can be found or accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to your query.
