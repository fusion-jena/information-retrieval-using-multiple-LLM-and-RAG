The given text does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it discusses the use of hyperparameters in general machine learning models. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the commencement of the learning process. They can significantly impact the performance of the model. Common examples include learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, batch size, epochs, etc. In the given text, hyperparameters are mentioned in the context of their role in estimating prediction errors for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Unfortunately, without additional context or details about the specific deep learning model being used, I am unable to provide exact hyperparameters used in the model.
