Based on the given information, it appears that the authors utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to deploy their deep learning models. However, there isn't any explicit mention of other cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used for deployment. Therefore, it can be concluded that the GEE platform was primarily used for deploying the deep learning models in this research.
