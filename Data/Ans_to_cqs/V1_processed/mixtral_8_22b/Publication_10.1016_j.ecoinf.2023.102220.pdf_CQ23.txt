To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models, including the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Neural Network (DNN), the authors employed several strategies. Firstly, they utilized diverse datasets consisting of various features related to environmental conditions and pest populations. This allowed them to capture different aspects of the problem and improve the robustness of their models.

Secondly, the authors implemented cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of their models. Specifically, they proposed using k-fold cross-validation to select optimal values for parameters like cluster and alpha, aiming to maximize the accuracy of their method. Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting and provides a better estimate of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

Lastly, while not explicitly mentioned in the given context, stratified sampling could have been applied during the train-test split of the time series data. Stratification ensures that both the training and testing sets maintain similar distributions of target classes, further improving the reliability of the evaluation results.

Overall, these measures contribute to enhancing the generalizability of the deep learning models presented in the paper.
