After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include metrics calculation, saliency maps, and creating a confusion matrix.

Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the trained model by calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics help in understanding how well the model has learned from the data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of an input image that contribute significantly towards the final prediction made by the model. They provide insights into what features the model is focusing on while making predictions.

Creating a confusion matrix is another useful postprocessing step that helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the model. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm based on the true labels and predicted labels. It provides information about the false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives, which can be further used to calculate other evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

In the given context, it is mentioned that a confusion matrix was created to depict TensorFlow's initial results with 20 species. This suggests that creating a confusion matrix was one of the postprocessing steps performed after the model training process. However, it is not explicitly stated whether any other postprocessing steps were carried out.
