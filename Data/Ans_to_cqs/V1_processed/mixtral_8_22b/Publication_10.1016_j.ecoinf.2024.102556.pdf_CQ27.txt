Unfortunately, based on the given context, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed explanation about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, we do know that the models used are part of the YOLO family, specifically YOLOv7, which is known for its fast target detection capabilities. It also has a three-module structure consisting of the input module, the backbone module, and the header network. Additionally, the text mentions that the baseline model was chosen to balance the limited computational power and speed of the airborne computer. This suggests that the deployment platform might be an airborne computer or UAV due to the keywords 'airborne computer', 'UAV MOT', and 'Procapra przewalskii monitoring'. But without further details, it's not possible to give specific steps regarding the deployment process such as model serialization or platform selection.
