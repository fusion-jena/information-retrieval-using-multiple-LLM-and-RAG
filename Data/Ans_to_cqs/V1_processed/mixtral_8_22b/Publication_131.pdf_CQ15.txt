Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate response based solely on the provided text. However, some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These methods help minimize the loss function during the training process by adjusting the model parameters iteratively.
