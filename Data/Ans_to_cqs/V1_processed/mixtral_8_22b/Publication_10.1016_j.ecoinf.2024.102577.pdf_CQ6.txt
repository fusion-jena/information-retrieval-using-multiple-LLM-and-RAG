Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include data cleaning, where missing or inconsistent values are removed or corrected; normalization, which scales numeric variables to a common range such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]; and feature engineering, where new features are created from existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. Additionally, it is often helpful to split the dataset into separate training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. The specific preprocessing steps used will depend on the nature of the data and the requirements of the particular deep learning algorithm being employed.
