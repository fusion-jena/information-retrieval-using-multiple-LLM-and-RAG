The method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is satellite imagery obtained through Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE is a cloud processing platform that provides a public catalog containing petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. This allows for high performance and rapid planetary-scale processing and analysis of images. The platform enables access, selection, and processing of satellite images in seconds to minutes, making it more efficient than traditional non-cloud databases.

In the given context, the initial Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification was performed using GEE. Satellite imagery from GEE was employed to classify land use types such as water bodies, urban areas, vegetation, and bare soil. These classified images were then used as input for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify Artisanal Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) sites.

Therefore, the main source of raw data collection in this deep learning pipeline is satellite imagery acquired via Google Earth Engine. Other sources like surveys or sensors are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
