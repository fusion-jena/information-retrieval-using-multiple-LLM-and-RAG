The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model, while specificity measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified. According to the given information, the best performing class was the Eurasian Collared Dove, which achieved a sensitivity of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.90. On the other hand, the worst performing class was the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, where the model attained a sensitivity of 0.58 and a specificity of 0.91. Additionally, the overall accuracy of the model was reported to be 0.83 for the train split and 0.74 for the test split.
