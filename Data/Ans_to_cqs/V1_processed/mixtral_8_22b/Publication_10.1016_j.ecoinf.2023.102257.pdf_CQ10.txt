The given context does not provide information about the specific code repository link of any deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several studies related to machine learning techniques for remote wildlife monitoring and species-level classification models. To find the relevant code repositories, one would need to search for them separately based on the authors and publications mentioned in the text. For instance, searching for "Boehner et al., 2022" or "Norouzzadeh et al., 2018" along with keywords like "GitHub," "code repository," or "pipeline" might yield results. Unfortunately, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the exact code repository links.
