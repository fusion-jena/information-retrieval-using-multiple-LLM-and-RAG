The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies or techniques used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the text that the authors may have used some form of cross-validation or evaluation metrics to assess their models' accuracy and reliability. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of high-quality training samples and proper sampling point layout for building precise and dependable models for biomass estimation. They also suggest that incorporating additional factors like population density, ecological engineering, temperature, and precipitation could improve the accuracy of the downscaling model for forest biomass density.
