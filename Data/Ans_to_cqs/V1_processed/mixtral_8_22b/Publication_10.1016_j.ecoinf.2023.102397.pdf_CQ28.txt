The text does not provide information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the automated remote biodiversity monitoring network (Arbimon) is linked to the Rainforest Connection website (<https://arbimon.rfcx.org/>). This suggests that the deployment might have been done using resources related to this website or platform. But without explicit mention of a cloud service provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, it cannot be definitively determined from the given context.
