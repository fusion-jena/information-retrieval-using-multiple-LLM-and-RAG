The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is for classification tasks. Specifically, the authors use a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) to classify forest species using hyperspectral images captured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The goal is to accurately identify different types of trees and plants in the forest environment. This application demonstrates how deep learning can be employed in remote sensing and environmental monitoring scenarios.
