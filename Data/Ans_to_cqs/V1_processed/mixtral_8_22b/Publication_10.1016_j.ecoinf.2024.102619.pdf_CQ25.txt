The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is for image classification. Specifically, the VGG16 network, sourced from the torch library, is being utilized for this task. The model is employed in two different approaches: CNN + SVM and pure CNN. In the former approach, the VGG16 network is modified into a feature extractor by keeping the architecture up to the first fully connected layer (FC1). These extracted features are then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. Two types of SVMs are evaluated: a linear SVM and a non-linear SVM, known as a Radial Basis Function (RBF). On the other hand, the latter approach uses the complete VGG16 network, including the feature extractor and classifier, for image classification. Both methods require hyperparameters for optimization during training to improve model performance.
