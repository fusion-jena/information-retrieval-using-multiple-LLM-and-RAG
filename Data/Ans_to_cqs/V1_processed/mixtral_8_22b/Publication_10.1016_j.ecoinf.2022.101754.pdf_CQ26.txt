Based on the provided context, it appears that the study utilizes a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the study uses 100 different splits to the training-and-test set for each setting. Additionally, tuning of the hyperparameters on the training set is performed for each set before model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameters. However, there is no explicit mention of other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being employed in this particular study.
