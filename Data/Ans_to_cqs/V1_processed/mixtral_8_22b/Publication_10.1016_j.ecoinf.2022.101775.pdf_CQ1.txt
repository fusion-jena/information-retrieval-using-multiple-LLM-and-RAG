The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference various sources of data that could potentially be used in a deep learning pipeline. For instance, the paper by Shah and Mishra discusses an IoT-enabled low power environment monitoring system for predicting PM2.5 levels, which suggests that sensors may be used to collect raw data. Additionally, Tamhane et al.'s work focuses on modeling contextual changes in user behavior in fashion e-commerce, implying that transactional or behavioral data from users might be collected. Lastly, van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn's research involves multivariate imputation, indicating that missing values in datasets may need to be addressed before being fed into a deep learning pipeline. Overall, while the context does not directly address the query, it implies that various types of data collection methods, including sensors, user transactions, and publicly available datasets, could be employed in a deep learning pipeline.
