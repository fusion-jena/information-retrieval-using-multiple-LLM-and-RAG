Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. It mentions that the paper discusses enhancing land cover/land use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural networks (DNN). However, it does not explicitly state what those hyperparameters are. Therefore, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
