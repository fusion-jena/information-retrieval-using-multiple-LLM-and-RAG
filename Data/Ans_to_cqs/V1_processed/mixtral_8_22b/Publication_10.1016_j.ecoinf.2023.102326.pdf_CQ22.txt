The text does not provide information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models mentioned in the study. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. The AUC-ROC provides a measure of how well the model distinguishes between classes. Without further information, it cannot be determined which specific metrics were used in this study.
