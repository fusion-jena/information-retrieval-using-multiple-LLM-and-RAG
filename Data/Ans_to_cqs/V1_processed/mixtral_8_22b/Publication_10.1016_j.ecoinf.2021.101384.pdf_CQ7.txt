The text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, or validation sets. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, one could infer that the dataset might be divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is employed to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set serves to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

Regarding the percentage distribution of the dataset among these subsets, there isn't a universally accepted rule. Common practice suggests using around 80% of the data for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. Nonetheless, this division may vary depending on factors like the size of the dataset, its complexity, and the nature of the problem being addressed.
