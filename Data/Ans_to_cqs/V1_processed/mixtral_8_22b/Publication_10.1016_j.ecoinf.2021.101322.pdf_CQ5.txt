Two datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. The first one is the Salmon Scale 9056 image dataset, which can be accessed via its DOI: 10.21335/NMDC-1050865887. Additionally, another unspecified dataset containing 150 images is mentioned, but it does not provide a clear name or reference. It seems like these datasets were specifically created for this study rather than being standard benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
