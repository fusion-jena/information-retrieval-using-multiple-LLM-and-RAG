The table titled "Hyperparameter fine-tuning results" provides information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimizer used. From the table, we can see that various learning rates were tested, including 0.001, 0.01, 0.0005, and 0.00001. Additionally, the number of filters and blocks varied across scenarios. For instance, Scenario 5, which was chosen as the optimal solution, utilized four blocks with filter sizes of 16, 32, 64, and 128. Unfortunately, without explicit information regarding the optimizer, I cannot provide further details on its specific use within the deep learning model.
