Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention or discussion about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques help ensure that the dataset is representative and balanced, reducing potential biases that could affect the performance of the deep learning model.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes by duplicating existing examples or generating synthetic ones. Undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes by randomly removing examples. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of data points representing various scenarios, conditions, and populations to improve the generalizability of the model.

In summary, although the given context doesn't discuss specific techniques for handling data bias, commonly employed methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
