The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses time series directly as predictors, suggesting that the raw data could have been collected through continuous monitoring using sensors or other automated means. Additionally, the use of high-resolution environmental data indicates that publicly available datasets might have been employed. Nonetheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods were used for gathering the raw data.
