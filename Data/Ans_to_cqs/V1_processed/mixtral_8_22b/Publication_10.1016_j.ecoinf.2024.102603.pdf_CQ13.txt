The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, common hyperparameters in deep learning include learning rate, optimizer type (such as Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, etc.), batch size, number of epochs, and others depending on the specific architecture and problem being addressed. For instance, if the deep learning model was a convolutional neural network (CNN), additional hyperparameters might include filter sizes, stride lengths, pooling types, and so forth. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the exact deep learning model employed, it is impossible to specify which hyperparameters were utilized.
