The paper by Wang et al. (2022) titled "Weed25: a deep learning dataset for weed identification" presents a new dataset called Weed25. However, there is no mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used for this study can be found. Therefore, it cannot be determined if the code repository is available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

Based on the information given, it appears that the authors did not provide any details about the availability of their code repository. It would be best to contact the corresponding author directly to request access to the code repository or further clarification regarding its availability.
