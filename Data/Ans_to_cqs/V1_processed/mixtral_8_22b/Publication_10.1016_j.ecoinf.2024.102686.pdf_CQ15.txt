The given context does not provide information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the use of a learning rate (Î·(t)) in equation (4) which decreases over time (t). This suggests that some form of optimization technique might be employed during the learning process, but without more explicit details, we cannot confirm if it is specifically SGD, Adam, or any other optimization method.
