The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the environmental condition models. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that common stopping criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or loss, or observing no significant improvement in the validation set performance over several epochs (i.e., a validation loss plateau). In this case, since the authors present various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, and F1 score for different models, they might have chosen one or more of these metrics as their stopping criterion during training.
