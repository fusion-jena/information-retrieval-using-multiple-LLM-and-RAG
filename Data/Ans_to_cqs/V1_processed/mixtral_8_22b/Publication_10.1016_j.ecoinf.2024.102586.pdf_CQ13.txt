The information provided does not contain details about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context. It is essential to have this information to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.

Based on the available context, we can only infer that the study uses environmental, climatic, soil, topographic, and anthropogenic data as input features for the models. However, there is no mention of the type of deep learning algorithm employed or its corresponding hyperparameters.
