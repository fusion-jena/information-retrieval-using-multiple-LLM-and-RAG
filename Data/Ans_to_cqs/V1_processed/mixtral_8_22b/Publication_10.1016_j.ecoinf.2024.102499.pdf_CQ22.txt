The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using three main metrics: recall, precision, and F-measure. Recall measures the proportion of actual positive instances that are correctly identified by the model. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. Precision measures the proportion of predicted positive instances that are actually correct. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. The F-measure is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances these two aspects of classification performance. A higher F-measure indicates better overall performance.
