The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies used to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer that there are several ways to monitor the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) during training. These methods include tracking metrics like loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the type of task (classification, regression, etc.). Additionally, techniques like cross-validation, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling could also be employed for monitoring and improving the model performance during training.
