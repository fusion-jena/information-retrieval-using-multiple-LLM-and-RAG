Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the context that the models are being evaluated using various evaluation metrics like MR, FAR, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Moreover, the learning rate, weight decay, and momentum values are mentioned for YOLOv5 training, which could suggest monitoring these hyperparameters during training. But without more detailed information about the training process or code implementation, it cannot be definitively stated what exact strategies are employed to monitor the model performance during training.
