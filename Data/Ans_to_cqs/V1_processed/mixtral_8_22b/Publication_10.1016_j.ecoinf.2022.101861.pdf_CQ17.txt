The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for the given task. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training time, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and thus simpler models. Other popular regularization methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. It is important to note that the choice of regularization method depends on various factors, including the nature of the problem, dataset size, model complexity, and computational resources available.
