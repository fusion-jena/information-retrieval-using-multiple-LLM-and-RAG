The given context does not provide information about the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that all CNNs were trained using the TensorFlow backend on a Tesla M100 GPU. However, it does not specify where the code can be found. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the code repository is located.
