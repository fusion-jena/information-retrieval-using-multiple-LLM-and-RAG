The article does not provide information about using any specific deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in their pipeline. Instead, they focus on two different types of models for species distribution modeling - Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forest (RF). These models are not considered deep learning models but rather traditional machine learning techniques. Therefore, based on the given context, there is no mention of using any particular deep learning model in the pipeline.
