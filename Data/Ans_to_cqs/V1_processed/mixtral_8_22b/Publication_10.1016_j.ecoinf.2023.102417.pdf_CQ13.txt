The text does not provide explicit details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it mentions that the model was trained using the Python library PyTorch, which is commonly used for building and training neural networks. It also states that the model was trained in a supervised manner, indicating that it likely involved the use of labeled training data. Additionally, the text notes that the model was designed to distinguish between various biocrust taxa, suggesting that it may have required careful tuning of its parameters to achieve high accuracy in this complex classification task.
