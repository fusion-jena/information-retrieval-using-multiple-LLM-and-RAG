The statistical analysis section describes the use of random forest classification for mapping seagrass meadows and species meadows. To evaluate the performance of this model, several metrics are employed based on the confusion matrix generated from the validation dataset. These metrics include Overall Accuracy (O.A.), Producer Accuracy (P.A.), and User Accuracy (U.A.).

O.A. measures the proportion of correctly classified validation samples to the total number of validation samples, regardless of class. This metric provides an overall assessment of the model's performance across all classes.

P.A., also known as sensitivity or recall, calculates the proportion of true positives (correctly identified instances of a particular class) out of the actual positive cases (total instances of that class). In other words, it indicates how well the model can identify instances belonging to a specific class.

U.A., also referred to as precision, determines the proportion of true positives out of all predicted positive cases (both true and false positives). It reflects the reliability of the model's predictions for a given class.

These three metrics—O.A., P.A., and U.A.—are presented in Table 2 for both seagrass meadows and species meadows mapping, covering various years such as 2003, 2007, 2010*, and 2019. Each row in the table corresponds to a specific year and type of meadow, displaying the respective values for O.A., U.A., and P.A.
