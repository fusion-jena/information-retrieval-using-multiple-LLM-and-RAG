Based on the given context, the deep learning pipeline uses images as its primary data format. Specifically, the authors use a ResNet-50 model to extract features from images for classification purposes. The input to this network is an image of size 224 x 224 pixels. Additionally, the authors mention gathering standard visual information and low-level image features from the dataset, which further supports the notion that images are the main data format used in this study. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline, such as audio, video, or CSV files.
