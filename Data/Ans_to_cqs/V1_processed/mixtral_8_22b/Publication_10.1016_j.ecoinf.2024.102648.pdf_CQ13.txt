The given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the study employs machine learning (bootstrap forest, boosted tree) and deep learning (artificial neural network) models to forecast the percent disease incidence of CLCuD. It can be inferred that the deep learning model used here might be an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). While the exact hyperparameters are not mentioned, common hyperparameters for MLP include learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, activation functions, weight initialization method, batch size, epochs, and optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop.
