In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss a form of semantic segmentation applied to extract four classes - urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road - from satellite images. This process involves assigning labels to individual pixels based on their respective classes, effectively creating pixel-wise masks for each class. While not explicitly mentioned, this could be seen as a type of data annotation technique within the deep learning pipeline.

It should also be noted that the context mentions dividing these labeled images into non-overlapping blocks of 256 x 256 pixels, which can be interpreted as another step in preparing the dataset for use in the deep learning pipeline. Although this isn't directly related to data annotation techniques like bounding boxes or instance segmentation, it still plays a crucial role in organizing and structuring the dataset for efficient processing during model training.
