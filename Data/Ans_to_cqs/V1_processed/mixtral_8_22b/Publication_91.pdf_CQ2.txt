The deep learning pipeline described in this context uses image data format. Specifically, it utilizes a dataset consisting of 35,573 images per channel, covering 35 different species, which results in a total of 426,876 images. These images are then processed through various stages such as center cropping, augmentation (flipping horizontally/vertically, adjustments in brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue), and splitting into training, validation, and testing sets. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
