The paper does not explicitly mention any specific dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses a general method for addressing issues related to imbalanced datasets and the need for large training datasets in a text classification pipeline. It uses a hierarchical classification approach, passing data through a series of classifiers with increasingly specific relevance criteria. The authors also suggest that researchers can annotate a randomly selected sample of collected data based on their own relevancy criteria. However, they note that this approach might not work well when relevant examples form a small portion of the collected data due to potential poor classification performance caused by imbalanced training data.
