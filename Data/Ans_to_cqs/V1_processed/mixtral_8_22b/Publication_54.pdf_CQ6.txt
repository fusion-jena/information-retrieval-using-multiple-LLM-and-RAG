Based on the given context, it appears that there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, the text does mention that the endemic bird data was acquired and preprocessed to overcome imbalance and data overfitting. This could imply various techniques such as data augmentation, which is mentioned later in the context. Data augmentation involves creating new samples by applying random transformations to the existing data, thus increasing the diversity of the dataset and reducing overfitting. Additionally, the context mentions splitting the data into training and testing sets, which is also a common step in preparing data for machine learning tasks. It's important to note that preprocessing steps can vary greatly depending on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model being used. Therefore, without more detailed information, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps involved in this particular case.
