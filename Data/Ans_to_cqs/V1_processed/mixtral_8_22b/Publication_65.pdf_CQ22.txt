The research article does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models. However, based on the information given, we can infer that some possible metrics include the number of parameters, training time, inference time, and processing time. Additionally, the authors discuss the use of absolute average accuracies and variability for the test set as measures of performance. It is important to note that these are only speculations based on the provided context, and the actual evaluation metrics used might differ.
