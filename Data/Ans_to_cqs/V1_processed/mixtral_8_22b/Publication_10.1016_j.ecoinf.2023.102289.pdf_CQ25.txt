The purpose of the deep learning model employed by LaDeco is semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a technology used in image recognition that assigns specific objects to each pixel of an image. It is primarily used to classify pixels into different categories or classes based on their features. In the case of LaDeco, the primary function is to calculate the pixel percentage of each landscape element in the image. By employing the deeplabv3+resnet269 model, users can identify and quantify various landscape elements present in images.
