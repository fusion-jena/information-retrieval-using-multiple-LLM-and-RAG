The text does not provide explicit information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model is trained on presence-only data, which includes WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude). These datasets serve as predictive features for the deep learning model. Therefore, instead of using standard image classification datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, this study employs various environmental and geographical datasets to train its deep species distribution model.
