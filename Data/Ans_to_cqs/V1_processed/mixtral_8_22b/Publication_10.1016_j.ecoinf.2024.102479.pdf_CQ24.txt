Strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping to reduce variability, employing ensemble methods to average out results, and utilizing deterministic algorithms where possible. However, it is important to note that some degree of randomness can be beneficial, as it helps prevent overfitting and encourages exploration during optimization.
