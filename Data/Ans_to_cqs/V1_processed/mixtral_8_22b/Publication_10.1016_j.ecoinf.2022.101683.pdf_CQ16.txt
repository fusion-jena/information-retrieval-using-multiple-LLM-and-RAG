The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation dataset (such as a minimum validation loss or a maximum validation accuracy), or observing no significant improvement in the validation loss or accuracy over several consecutive epochs (i.e., a validation loss plateau). In this particular study, the authors mention using a 10th percentile training presence threshold, but they do not specify whether this threshold is used to determine when training is complete or if it serves another purpose. Therefore, without additional context, it is difficult to definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete in this study.
