The text does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the synthetic connectivity data was generated using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python package. It also discusses classical and deep learning methods for generating synthetic data, mentioning examples such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) for deep learning methods, and regression, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines for classical machine learning methods. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
