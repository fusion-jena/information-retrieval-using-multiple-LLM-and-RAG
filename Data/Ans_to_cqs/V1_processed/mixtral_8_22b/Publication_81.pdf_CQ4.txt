The given context does not provide any specific details about the application of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the proposed deep learning method aligns DNA sequences to obtain sequences with the same length and converts them into numerical data using one-hot encoding. This could be considered as a form of data preprocessing rather than data augmentation. It would be best to refer to other sources or consult domain experts for accurate information regarding the use of data augmentation techniques in this particular case.
