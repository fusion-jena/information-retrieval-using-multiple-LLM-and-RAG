In the paper, the authors mention that they used various data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of their model. These techniques include horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, random cropping, rotation, scaling, and shearing. However, the specific details about how these techniques were implemented or what parameters were used are not mentioned in the given excerpts. Therefore, based on the information available, we cannot provide more detailed information about the implementation of these data augmentation techniques.
