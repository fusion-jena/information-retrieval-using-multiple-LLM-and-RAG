The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the learning rate (Î·(t)) and the neighborhood (Sk(t)). The learning rate decreases with time t, while the neighborhood refers to the group of neurons surrounding the winning neuron at time t. These hyperparameters play crucial roles in training the self-organizing map (SOM) network, where the learning rate controls the step size during gradient descent optimization, and the neighborhood determines the extent of influence on neighboring neurons when updating the weights. However, other common hyperparameters such as the choice of optimizer or regularization techniques are not explicitly mentioned in this context.

Based on the given information, it appears that the authors have focused primarily on describing the SOM algorithm rather than discussing the broader aspects of deep learning models. Therefore, details regarding additional hyperparameters like batch size, epochs, or activation functions are not available from the provided context.
