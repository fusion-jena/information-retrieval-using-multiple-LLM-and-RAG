The given context does not provide direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out results across multiple runs, and employing techniques like cross-validation to ensure robust model performance. These strategies help mitigate the impact of random initialization and improve overall model reliability.
