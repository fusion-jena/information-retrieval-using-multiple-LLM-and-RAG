Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the specific application and data type. However, some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so that they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This helps ensure that each feature contributes equally to the final output and prevents any particular feature from dominating the others due to its larger magnitude.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the values of input features to bring them to a similar scale. This can help improve the convergence speed during training and prevent numerical instability issues.

3. Cleaning: This step involves removing noise, outliers, or missing values from the input data. It also includes handling categorical variables by converting them into numerical representations such as one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.

4. Augmentation: This technique involves creating additional training examples by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., to existing samples. This can help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the generalizability of the model.

In the given context, it appears that the authors extracted feature vectors from the fixed inception layers using Google Cloud DataFlow and used these features as the basis for retraining the new fine-tuned layers. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is likely that the authors performed some form of normalization or scaling on their input data prior to feeding it into the deep learning model. Additionally, the use of dropout as a form of regularization suggests that the authors took measures to prevent overfitting during training.
