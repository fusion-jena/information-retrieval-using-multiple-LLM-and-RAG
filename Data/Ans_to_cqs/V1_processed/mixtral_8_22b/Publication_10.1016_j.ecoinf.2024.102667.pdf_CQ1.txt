Based on the given context, it appears that the studies primarily utilize existing datasets rather than directly collecting raw data through surveys or sensors. For instance, the land use/cover dataset for China with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km was obtained from RESDC, covering various land use/cover categories and subcategories. This dataset was created using a combination of manual and automated interpretation, along with on-site data validation. Additionally, the boundary datasets for ecological engineering were sourced from the National Ecological Science Data Center. However, there is no explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline within this context.
