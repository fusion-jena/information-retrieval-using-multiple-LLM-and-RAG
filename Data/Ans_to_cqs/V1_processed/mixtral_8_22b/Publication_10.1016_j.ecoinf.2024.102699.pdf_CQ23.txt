To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of recordings from 397 different bird species. This wide range of species helped prevent overfitting and ensured that the models could accurately classify birdsongs even when presented with new, unseen species. Secondly, extensive data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the models' ability to handle variations in real-world scenarios. These techniques included integrating various noise samples and non-bird audio elements into the training data. An iterative selection process was followed where only those augmentations that improved classification performance were chosen. Lastly, the study focused on using multiple deep learning models, including Vision Transformers (ViT), DenseNet-161, and ResNet-50. By comparing these models and selecting the best performing one (ViT-B/16), the researchers aimed to create a highly accurate and generalizable model for birdsong classification.
