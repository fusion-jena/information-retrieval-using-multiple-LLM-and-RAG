Based on the provided context, it appears there might be confusion in the query as it mentions "deep learning" but the context discusses Species Distribution Models (SDMs). However, I will attempt to provide an answer based on the information given.

In the context of SDMs, the purpose of the models is not necessarily related to deep learning tasks like classification, segmentation, or detection. Instead, these models aim to predict the geographic distribution of species based on environmental variables. They use various algorithms or "engines," including both parametric and non-parametric methods, as well as frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

The goal of these models is to create accurate, unbiased representations of a species' niche while accounting for potential biases present in biodiversity datasets. This allows researchers to better understand species distributions and their relationships with environmental factors.

However, if we were to consider deep learning within the broader scope of ecological modeling, its applications could include image-based species identification (classification), object detection for wildlife monitoring, or even semantic segmentation for mapping habitats from remote sensing imagery. But again, these specific uses of deep learning are not directly discussed in the provided context.
