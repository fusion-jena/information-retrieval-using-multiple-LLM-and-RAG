The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses various aspects related to using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for tasks like automated animal recognition and counting. It also mentions architectures like ResNet18FPN, ResNet34FPN, and ResNet152FPN, which are based on the popular ResNet architecture. Additionally, there is reference to a paper titled "R-CNN for Small Object Detection" published in ACCV 2016 proceedings, but no explicit mention of the dataset used in that study. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
