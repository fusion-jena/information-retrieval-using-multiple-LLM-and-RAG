The completion of training for machine learning models depends on several factors, including the specific task, data size, complexity, and available resources. One common criterion used to determine when training should stop is the validation loss plateau. This occurs when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly after each epoch, indicating that further training may lead to overfitting without improving generalization performance. Other criteria include early stopping, which halts training when the validation error starts increasing, and setting a fixed number of iterations or epochs based on computational budget constraints. Ultimately, the choice of criteria depends on the problem domain and desired tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.
