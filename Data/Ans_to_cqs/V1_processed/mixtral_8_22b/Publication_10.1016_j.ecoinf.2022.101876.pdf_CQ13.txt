The given context does not provide any explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. It primarily focuses on discussing the performance evaluation of a pre-trained model called MegaDetector, developed by Microsoft AI for Earth, for detecting wildlife in camera trap images from Arctic Alaska. The text discusses various aspects like true positive rates, recall, and other performance measures but does not delve into the details of the underlying deep learning architecture or its hyperparameters. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
