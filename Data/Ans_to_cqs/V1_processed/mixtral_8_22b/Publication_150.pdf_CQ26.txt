The text does not provide explicit details about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that exploring new ways of learning and data generation can enhance the model. One such method mentioned is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can potentially improve error rates for poorly sampled species and low accuracy due to class imbalance by generating synthetic image data when new images are difficult to acquire. Although not explicitly stated, this approach could be considered a form of data augmentation aimed at addressing data bias caused by class imbalance. Other common techniques to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but these methods are not discussed in the given context.
