The text does not provide explicit information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for storing data from multiple satellites and performing big data fast computation. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively state that the deep learning model was deployed using any particular platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
