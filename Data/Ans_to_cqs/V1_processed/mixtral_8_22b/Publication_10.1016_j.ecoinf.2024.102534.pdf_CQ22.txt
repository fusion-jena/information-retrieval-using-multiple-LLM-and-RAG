In this study, two main metrics are used to assess the performance of the model predictions: Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS). The AUC is a widely used metric for evaluating binary classifiers, while TSS is a measure of the ability of a forecast system to distinguish between events and non-events. Both these metrics provide insights into the overall performance of the model. However, it should be noted that other commonly used metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned in this context. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm the use of AUC and TSS as the primary evaluation metrics.
