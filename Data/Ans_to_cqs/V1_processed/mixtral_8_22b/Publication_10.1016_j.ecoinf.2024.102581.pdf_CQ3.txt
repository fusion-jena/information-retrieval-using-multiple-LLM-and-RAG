The given context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that data augmentation techniques were employed during the learning phase of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These techniques included random rotation, random cropping, random flipping, random color jittering, and random noise addition. Data augmentation is a strategy used to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to existing images, which can help improve the generalization capabilities of the model.
