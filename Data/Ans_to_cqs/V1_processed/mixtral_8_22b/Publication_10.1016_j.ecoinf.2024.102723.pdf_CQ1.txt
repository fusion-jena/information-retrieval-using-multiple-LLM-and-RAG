The text does not provide explicit information about specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning and IoT in agriculture, we can infer that various methods might be employed. These include using sensors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture sensors, cameras for image analysis, drones for remote sensing, GPS for location tracking, and weather stations for meteorological data collection. Additionally, public datasets like satellite imagery from platforms like Google Earth Engine could also be leveraged. Surveys may also be conducted to gather additional information relevant to the agricultural context. It should be noted that these are speculative answers based on typical approaches rather than direct evidence from the given text.
