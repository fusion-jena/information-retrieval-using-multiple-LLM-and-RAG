In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, one method mentioned that could potentially help prevent overfitting is Local Response Normalization (LRN).

LRN is a technique used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) where the input neurons compete against each other, resulting in the enhancement of larger responses and suppression of smaller ones. By doing so, LRN helps to improve the generalization of the model, making it more robust and less prone to overfitting.

While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that techniques like dropout and L2 regularization may also have been employed in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the context. Dropout is a widely used regularization technique in neural networks where some neurons are randomly ignored during training, helping to prevent overfitting. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and thus reducing the complexity of the model.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the use of regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, it mentions the use of Local Response Normalization (LRN) as a potential means to prevent overfitting. Additionally, based on common practices in deep learning, it can be assumed that techniques like dropout and L2 regularization might also have been utilized.
