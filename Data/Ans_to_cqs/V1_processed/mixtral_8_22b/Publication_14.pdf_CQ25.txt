The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is likely used for object classification. This is suggested by the mention of "classification" in relation to motion detection and the use of a pre-trained model for identifying hummingbird visits. Additionally, the process of extracting feature vectors from fixed inception layers and retraining new fine-tuned layers further supports the idea that the model is being used for classification purposes.
