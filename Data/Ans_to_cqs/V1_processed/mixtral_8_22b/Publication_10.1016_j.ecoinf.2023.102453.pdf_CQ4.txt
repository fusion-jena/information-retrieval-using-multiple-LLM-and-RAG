Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and color space transformation. These techniques help increase the diversity of the training set and improve the generalizability of the model. In this case, the only mentioned preprocessing technique is image resizing, which is done to fit the input resolution requirements of the chosen models. Therefore, without further details, it cannot be confirmed if any other data augmentation techniques were utilized in this particular study.
