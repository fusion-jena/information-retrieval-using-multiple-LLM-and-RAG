The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models mentioned in the text. However, based on common practices in the field, popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch could potentially be used for building these models. For example, Unnikrishnan et al. (2019) present novel deep learning frameworks for three distinct networks (VGG, AlexNet, ConvNet); these networks are commonly built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch. Similarly, Kadhim and Abed (2019) use CNN for extracting features with the help of VGG19, AlexNet, Resnet50 pretraining, and GoogLeNet modules, all of which can also be implemented using TensorFlow or PyTorch. Nevertheless, without further contextual information, we cannot definitively state which framework was used in each case.
