The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, it is important to note that splitting the data is crucial for evaluating the performance of the model accurately. Commonly, the data is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set.

The training set is used to fit the model, i.e., adjust its weights and biases during the learning phase. The validation set is employed to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is utilized to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

Typically, the data is randomly split into these subsets, maintaining the same distribution across them. A commonly used ratio is 60/20/20 for the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. However, this may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand. For instance, if there is a class imbalance in the data, stratified sampling might be preferred to ensure that each subset maintains the original class proportions.
