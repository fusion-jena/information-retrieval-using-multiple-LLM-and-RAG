The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the integration of data from various sources into a single product, specifically referring to projects like AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics. These projects produce high-quality, multidisciplinary data packages containing one or more data files and associated metadata. While the context does not specify the exact format of these data files, it implies that they could potentially include various types of data, such as images, audio, video, or structured data like CSV. Nevertheless, without explicit information on the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context.
