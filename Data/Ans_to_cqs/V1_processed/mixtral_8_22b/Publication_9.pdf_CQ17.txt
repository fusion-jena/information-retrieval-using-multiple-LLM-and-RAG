The text does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the concept of minimizing error between model output and expected output through optimal adjustment of model weights during training. Stochastic Gradient Descent with Backpropagation is mentioned as an optimization algorithm used for this purpose. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization can also help in achieving this objective by preventing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize to new data. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training to reduce co-dependency among them, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights. These methods are commonly used in conjunction with optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent to improve model performance.
