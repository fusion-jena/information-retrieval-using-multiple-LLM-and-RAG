The text does not provide specific links to any data repository related to the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two major data repositories, namely the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). These platforms host vast amounts of species occurrence records from around the world. It is mentioned that the authors followed Zizka et al.'s (2020) methodology to curate their dataset, but no direct link to this dataset or its repository is given. Furthermore, the text states that the data will be made available upon request, suggesting that the dataset might not yet be openly accessible through a public repository. Therefore, without additional information, I cannot provide a specific link to the deep learning pipeline's data repository.
