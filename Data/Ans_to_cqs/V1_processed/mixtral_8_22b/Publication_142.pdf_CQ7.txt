The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, it mentions the importance of considering the distribution of the training data and the potential gap between this and the test data on which the developed algorithms will be evaluated. This suggests that the choice of splitting criteria may depend on factors such as ensuring representative samples across different classes or categories within the data, maintaining similar distributions between training and testing sets, and avoiding overfitting or underfitting during the training process. Common practices for splitting data include random sampling, stratified sampling based on class labels, or using temporal or spatial splits when dealing with sequential or geospatial data.
