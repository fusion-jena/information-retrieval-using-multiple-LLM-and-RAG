The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is primarily for object detection and classification. Specifically, the model is designed to identify and classify different plant species based on their visual characteristics. This is evident through the mention of the PlantCLEF challenges, where the goal is to accurately identify plants from a large and complex image dataset. Additionally, the use of Faster R-CNN, a popular deep learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in object detection tasks, further supports this conclusion.
