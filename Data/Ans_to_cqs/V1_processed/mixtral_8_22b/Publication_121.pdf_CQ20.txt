According to the given context, the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is a Lenovo laptop equipped with an 8265U CPU at 1.80 GHz of Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM running on a Windows 10 64-bit system. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of any specific GPU or TPU for the training process. It only mentions that one of the challenges faced during the training process is the need for powerful GPUs for a faster learning process. This suggests that although GPUs could have been beneficial for the training process, they were not specifically mentioned as being used in this case.
