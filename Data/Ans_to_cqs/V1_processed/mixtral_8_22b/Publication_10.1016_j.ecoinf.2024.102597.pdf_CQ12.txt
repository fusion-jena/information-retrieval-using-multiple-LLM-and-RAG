The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered but not implemented due to the limited number of samples. Therefore, I cannot determine whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer model was used in the pipeline.
