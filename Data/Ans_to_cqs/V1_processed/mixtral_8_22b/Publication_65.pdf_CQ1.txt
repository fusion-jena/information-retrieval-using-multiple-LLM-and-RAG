The text does not provide explicit information on the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using data with a high spatial resolution (Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 10 cm) within an urban area inside the Cerrado biome. This suggests that remote sensing techniques, such as satellite imagery or drone photography, might have been employed to gather the required data. Additionally, the study uses five state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to process the data, indicating that the focus is primarily on utilizing existing models rather than creating new ones. Nevertheless, without further details about the source of the data, it cannot be definitively stated which specific methods were used for gathering raw data.
