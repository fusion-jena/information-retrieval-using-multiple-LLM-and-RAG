The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have used audio recordings from various devices placed at different locations in Bochum, Germany. The dataset consists of approximately one million minutes of audio recordings from 23 different sites. It is also mentioned that these recordings cover longer recording periods, such as several months. Therefore, it can be assumed that the authors collected raw data using some form of audio sensors or microphones installed at specific locations. Unfortunately, there is no further information available regarding the exact nature of these sensors or any other details related to the collection of raw data.
