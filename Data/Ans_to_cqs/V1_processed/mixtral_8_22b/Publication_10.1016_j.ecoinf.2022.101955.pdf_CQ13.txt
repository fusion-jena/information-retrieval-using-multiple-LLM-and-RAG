The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it mentions that the ANN model used the 'nnet' package, which allows for adjusting weighted decay and size to prevent overfitting. These could be considered as hyperparameters in this context. Additionally, the number of hidden layers and neurons in the input and output layers are also mentioned as part of the model configuration. For the ANN model, the primary tuning parameters were size and decay, controlled using the Control() function. Unfortunately, no further details regarding other potential hyperparameters are given in the provided context.
