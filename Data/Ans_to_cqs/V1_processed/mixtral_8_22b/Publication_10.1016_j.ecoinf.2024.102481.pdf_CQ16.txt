Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of Random Forest Classification, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. Typically, in such algorithms, training is stopped based on certain criteria like early stopping or when the error rate reaches a minimum threshold. In some cases, training might continue until the maximum number of trees is reached or if the out-of-bag (OOB) error stops improving significantly. Unfortunately, without more specific details regarding the training process, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
