The paper introduces the first Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, which includes its detailed metadata and the acquisition protocol description. However, the specific method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. It only states that the dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species using six different commercial cameras. Therefore, based on the information provided, one can infer that the method employed for gathering raw data might involve capturing images or videos of these species using various commercial cameras.
