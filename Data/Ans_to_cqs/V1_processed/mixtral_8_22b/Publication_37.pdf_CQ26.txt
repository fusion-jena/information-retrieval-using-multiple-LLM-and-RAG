Based on the given context, there is no direct mention or discussion about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data imbalance include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in both sets. Oversampling increases the number of instances in minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in majority classes by removing samples. Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data from underrepresented classes.

In the context of the provided information, the authors use data augmentation [17], which is not directly related to handling data imbalance but rather focuses on increasing the amount of available data through various transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This technique helps improve the performance of deep learning models by providing them with more varied examples.
