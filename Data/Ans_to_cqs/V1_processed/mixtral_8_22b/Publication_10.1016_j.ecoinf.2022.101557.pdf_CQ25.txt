The text does not explicitly state the specific task or purpose of the deep learning model being trained. However, based on the information given about the model architecture and training process, it appears that the model is likely being used for image classification tasks. Specifically, the model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is commonly used for image recognition and classification tasks. Additionally, the model is trained using a cross-entropy loss function, which is often used for multi-class classification problems. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model is to classify images into multiple categories.
