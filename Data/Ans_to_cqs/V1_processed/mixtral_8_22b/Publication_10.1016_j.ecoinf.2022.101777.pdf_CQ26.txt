To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique where the dataset is divided into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset, reducing any potential biases towards certain classes.

Oversampling involves increasing the frequency of minority class examples in the dataset by duplicating them or creating synthetic instances based on existing ones. This helps balance the dataset and reduce bias towards majority classes.

Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the frequency of majority class examples in the dataset by randomly removing some instances. This also balances the dataset but may result in loss of information if too many instances are removed.

Diverse data collection involves collecting more data from underrepresented classes or sources to increase their representation in the dataset. This can be done through active learning, where the model identifies areas with high uncertainty and requests additional labeled data, or transfer learning, where knowledge gained from one task is applied to another related task.

These techniques aim to mitigate data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline and improve the performance and generalization ability of machine learning models. However, it is important to note that no single technique guarantees optimal results, and multiple approaches should be explored to find the best solution for a given problem.
