The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a Wide Residual Network (WideResNet). This architecture is built upon the original ResNet design but employs changes suggested in Xie et al., 2018. The model consists of three main components: a pre-processing block, a series of residual stacks, and a classification block. The pre-processing block transforms the input spectrogram, while the residual stacks use 3x3 kernels with padding, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. The classification block results in probability predictions for all classes, followed by global log-mean-exponential pooling and sigmoid activation.
