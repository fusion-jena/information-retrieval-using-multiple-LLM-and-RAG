The text does not provide explicit information on specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that data augmentation strategies were employed to increase the training set size fourfold. These strategies include horizontal flipping, adding Gaussian noise, and reducing contrast. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalizability of the trained model by artificially increasing the amount of available training data and introducing variations similar to those encountered in real-world scenarios.
