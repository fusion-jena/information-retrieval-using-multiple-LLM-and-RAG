The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this study is not explicitly stated; however, based on the given information, we can infer that the primary goal is image classification. Specifically, the authors use ResNet-50, a popular deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The model generates a 1000-dimensional feature vector, which is then utilized to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This SVM classifier is employed to categorize insect image backgrounds into two distinct classes. Therefore, the overall objective of this deep learning approach appears to be the accurate classification of insect images based on their respective backgrounds.
