Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based solely on the given text. However, these optimization techniques are commonly used in machine learning models to find the optimal set of hyperparameters that minimize error or maximize performance. Grid search involves trying out every combination of parameters within a manually specified range, while random search randomly selects parameter combinations within the same range. Other popular methods include Bayesian Optimization and Gradient Descent.
