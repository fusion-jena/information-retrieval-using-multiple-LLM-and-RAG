Based on the given information, it appears that the training process lasted for a fixed number of epochs rather than being determined by specific criteria such as a validation loss plateau. In this case, the network training persisted for 120 epochs. However, there is no mention of any specific criteria used to determine when training should be stopped or considered complete. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot definitively state what criteria are used to determine when training is complete.
