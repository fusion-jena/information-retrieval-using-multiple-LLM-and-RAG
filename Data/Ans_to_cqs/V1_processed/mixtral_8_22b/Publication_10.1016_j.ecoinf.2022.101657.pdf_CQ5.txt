The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various aspects related to image processing and analysis in ecological studies using camera traps. It mentions several papers that have utilized deep learning techniques for tasks like object detection, instance segmentation, and identification of animal species in video clips captured by camera traps. These include works by Wang et al. (2021), Wei et al. (2020), Xi et al. (2021), and Schindler and Steinhage (2021). While these papers do not specify the exact datasets they used, they likely employed custom datasets comprising images or video clips of animals captured through camera traps.

In general, popular datasets used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits commonly used for training and testing image classification algorithms. CIFAR consists of two datasets, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which contain small natural images labeled over 10 and 100 classes, respectively. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing millions of images categorized into thousands of classes, making it one of the most widely used datasets for training deep learning models in computer vision.
