The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the use of wavelet transform hidden Markov models (WT-HMM) for enhancing classification performance and emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective model training. It also mentions a study by Ibrahim et al. (2018) focusing on feature extraction methods for detecting North Atlantic right whale up-calls but does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Similarly, another cited work by Kaiser and Hudgins (1994) introduces wavelets, which can be used for signal processing tasks like denoising or compression, but again, no explicit reference to data augmentation techniques is made. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine what data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
