The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F-measure. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of total positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of actual positive instances. F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. For instance, Table 3 shows the evaluation of the YOLOv4 model with and without Random Erasing using these three metrics. Similarly, Table 4 compares the performance of different models like EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, EfficientNet-B2, EfficientNet-B3, and Xception using Precision, Recall, and F-measure. Additionally, confusion matrices are used to assess the performance of the two-stage detection using the EfficientNet-B1 model with and without random erasing (Table 5).
