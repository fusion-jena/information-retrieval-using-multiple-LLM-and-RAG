The study uses a practice-oriented approach to validate their deep learning model by splitting the data on the sticky plate level. Individual insects belonging to the same sticky plate image are kept together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). This allows them to evaluate the model's performance by predicting a class for any given object it detects on unseen sticky plate images - data it never saw during training. The goal is to mimic how the model would be used in real-world scenarios.
