The text does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models often involve normalization or standardization of input features, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. Normalization scales numerical input features to a range between 0 and 1, while standardization transforms them to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Handling missing values can be done through imputation techniques like replacing missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the respective column. Encoding categorical variables involves converting categorical data into numerical form, usually through label encoding or one-hot encoding. Feature scaling ensures all input features have similar magnitudes, preventing any single feature from dominating the others during training.
