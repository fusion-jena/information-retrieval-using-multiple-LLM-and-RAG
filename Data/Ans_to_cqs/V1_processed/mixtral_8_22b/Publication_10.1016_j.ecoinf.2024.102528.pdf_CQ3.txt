The authors did not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in creating the Agmon annotated dataset. However, they mentioned that the dataset consists of over 10,900 annotated recordings of more than 75 species. This suggests that the annotation technique might involve labeling or tagging audio files with relevant information about the bird species present in each recording. Since the task involves identifying bird species based on their vocalizations, it is likely that the annotation involved assigning labels corresponding to different bird species to segments of audio data containing their respective calls or songs. Unfortunately, without explicit details regarding the annotation methodology, I cannot provide a definitive answer on whether bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or other specific techniques were employed.
