Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study uses a dataset containing various environmental features like soil moisture, pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global radiation, reflected radiation, atmospheric radiation, emitted radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, carbon dioxide flux, etc. These features are sourced from different stations like Soil Moisture Probe, Radiation Station, Eddy Covariance Station, and AEMET (Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog√≠a). The dataset is divided into training and testing sets with an 80:20 ratio using random sampling to maintain representativeness and minimize bias. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV function from scikit-learn library, employing a five-fold cross-validation method and negative mean square error as the target metric.
