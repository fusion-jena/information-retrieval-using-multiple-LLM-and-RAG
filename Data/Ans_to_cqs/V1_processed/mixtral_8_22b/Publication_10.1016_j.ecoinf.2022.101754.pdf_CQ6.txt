Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, common preprocessing steps often involve normalization or standardization of input features, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. These steps help improve the performance and convergence speed of the model during training. It should be noted that these preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the chosen deep learning algorithm.

The context mentions four methods used to model forest AGB: AdaBoost, Random Decision Forest (RF), Multilayer Neural Network (NET), and Bayesian Ridge Regression (Bayes). However, it does not provide information about any preprocessing steps involved before training these models.
