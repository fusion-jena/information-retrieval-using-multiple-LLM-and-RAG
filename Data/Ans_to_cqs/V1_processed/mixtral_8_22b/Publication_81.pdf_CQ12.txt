The deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as being a specific type such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer. However, it is stated that the model uses Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE). This suggests that the model employs a form of autoencoder, which is a type of neural network used for learning efficient codings of input data. Specifically, the model combines Elastic Net regularization with stacked autoencoders. Elastic Net regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, while stacked autoencoders involve multiple layers of autoencoders working together to learn increasingly abstract representations of the input data.
