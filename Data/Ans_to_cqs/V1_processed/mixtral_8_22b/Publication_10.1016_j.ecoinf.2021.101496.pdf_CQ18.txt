The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved dividing the dataset into a "training dataset" containing 60 randomly selected records and a "testing dataset" that contained the remaining 29 records. All three models, including the simple linear model (LM), generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and an artificial neural network (ANN), were then fitted using the "training dataset" and further validated using the "testing dataset". This allowed for monitoring the performance of each model during training and assessing their predictive capabilities on unseen data. Additionally, statistical measures such as R-squared values and mean absolute differences were calculated to evaluate the goodness of fit and accuracy of the models.
