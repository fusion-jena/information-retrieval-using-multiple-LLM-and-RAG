According to the provided context, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through publicly available data from Cornell Universityâ€™s Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds. This suggests that the researchers utilized existing datasets rather than conducting their own surveys or deploying sensors to collect new data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the method used for collecting raw data in this case is accessing and utilizing publicly available datasets.
