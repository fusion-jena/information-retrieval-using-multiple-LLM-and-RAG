The purpose of the deep learning model is to classify Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) data frames into specified sound source classes. This is achieved by starting with a pre-trained model (EfficientNet B0) and freezing its original feature extractor. Then, fully connected layers are trained to classify the PAM data frames based on their spectrogram representations, which are derived from audio data inputs. The goal is to create a model capable of accurately identifying different types of sounds present in the PAM data.
