There are several data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, including bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within images or videos, while semantic segmentation involves labeling every pixel in an image with a class label. Instance segmentation combines both bounding boxes and semantic segmentation to identify individual instances of objects within an image. Other techniques include polygon annotation, key point annotation, and text annotation. The choice of technique depends on the specific application and requirements of the project.

Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.
