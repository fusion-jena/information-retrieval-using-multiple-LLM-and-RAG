The provided context does not explicitly mention any criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some possible ways to split the data could include using a random stratified split, time series split, or grouping by certain features like site ID, plot ID, tree ID, or location ID. It would also depend on the specific requirements and goals of the deep learning model being trained.
