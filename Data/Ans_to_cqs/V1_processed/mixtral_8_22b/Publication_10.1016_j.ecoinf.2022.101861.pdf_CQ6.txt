The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it can be inferred that some form of data preparation was performed during the extraction process using Kaleidoscope software. This tool was used to extract sounds that met certain signal parameters, which could be considered a type of filtering or cleaning process. Additionally, the use of machine learning and convolutional neural networks is mentioned for future studies, suggesting that these techniques would require appropriate data preprocessing before being applied.
