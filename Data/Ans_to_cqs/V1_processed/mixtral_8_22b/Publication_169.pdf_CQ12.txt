A combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used in the pipeline. Specifically, the proposed network system consists of 20 layers, including 12 convolutional layers, five pooling layers, one fully connected layer, one LSTM layer, and one output layer with the softmax function for classification. The convolutional layer uses a size of 3x3 kernels activated by the ReLU function for extracting features, while the max-pooling layer applies a size of 2x2 kernels to reduce the dimensions of an input image. Finally, the information is passed to the LSTM layer for classification purposes.
