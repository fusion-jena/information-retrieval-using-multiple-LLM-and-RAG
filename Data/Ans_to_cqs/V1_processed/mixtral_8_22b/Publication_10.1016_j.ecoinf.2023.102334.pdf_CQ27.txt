The provided context does not contain specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context. However, generally speaking, after training a deep learning model, common steps for deployment include model serialization (converting the model into a format suitable for storage or transmission), selecting a platform for hosting the model (such as cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure), and integrating the deployed model into an application or service through APIs or SDKs.
