To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, several metrics were used. These include overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, and mean F1-score. Additionally, confusion matrices were created to compare the products generated by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) models against the validation datasets from Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) and Canadian Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation (CCMEO). Per-class F1-scores were also calculated for both models using these validation datasets. Furthermore, user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) were computed for each wetland type based on the confusion matrices.

In summary, the evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of the deep learning models are overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, mean F1-score, confusion matrices, per-class F1-scores, user accuracy (UA), and producer accuracy (PA).
