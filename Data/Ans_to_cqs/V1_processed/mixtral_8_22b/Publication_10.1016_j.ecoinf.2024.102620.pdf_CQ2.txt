Based on the given information, it appears that various types of data were used for this study. However, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. Nevertheless, we can infer some possible data formats based on the available details.

For instance, the NDVI data utilized was the MOD13Q1.006 dataset, which is likely in a raster format due to its spatial resolution and use of satellite imagery. Similarly, the vegetation type data, DEM data, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data could also be in raster or vector formats depending on their sources and processing methods.

However, without explicit mention of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, I cannot provide a definitive answer. It would be best to refer to the actual implementation or contact the authors for more precise information regarding the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
