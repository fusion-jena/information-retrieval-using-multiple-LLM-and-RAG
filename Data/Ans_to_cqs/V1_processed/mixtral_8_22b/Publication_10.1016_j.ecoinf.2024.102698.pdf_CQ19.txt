Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated which specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning models mentioned in the text. However, it is clear that various machine learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been employed in developing these models. It is also noted that the YData Python package has been utilized for generating synthetic connectivity data using a GAN model. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state which exact deep learning frameworks were used, it is evident that multiple advanced machine learning techniques have been applied in building these models.
