The deep learning model used in the pipeline is YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3), which is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This model was chosen for its improved performance compared to previous versions, thanks to the use of a new CNN feature extractor called Darknet-53. Darknet-53 is a 53-layered CNN that employs 3x3 and 1x1 convolutional layers, providing advanced accuracy with fewer floating-point operations and faster speed. Additionally, Darknet-53 incorporates skip connections inspired by ResNet, further enhancing its efficiency.
