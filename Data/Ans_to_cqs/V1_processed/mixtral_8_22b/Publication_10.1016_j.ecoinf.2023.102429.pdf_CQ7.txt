The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the desired level of generalization. Common approaches to splitting the data include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series-based splits. In many cases, the data is divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation sets. The training set is used to fit the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance and tune hyperparameters. The validation set is often used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model. However, the specific criteria used may vary depending on the application and goals of the modeling process.
