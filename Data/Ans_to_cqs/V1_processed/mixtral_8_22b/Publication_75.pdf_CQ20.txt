Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in this paper. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether GPUs, TPUs, or other types of hardware were utilized during the training process.

Based on the given context, the authors have focused primarily on describing their proposed methodology, experimental setup, and evaluation metrics rather than providing details about the computational infrastructure employed for training their models. Consequently, without additional information from the authors or further analysis of related literature, it remains unclear what type of hardware resources were used for training these deep learning models.
