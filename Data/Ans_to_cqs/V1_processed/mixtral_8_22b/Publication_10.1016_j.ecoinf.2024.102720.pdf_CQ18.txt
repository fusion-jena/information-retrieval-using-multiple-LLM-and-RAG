The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the researchers have evaluated the model's performance by testing its fitness using various common model fit metrics such as Chi-square value, Goodness-of-fit Index (GFI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Normal Fit Index (NFI), Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), Incremental Fit Index (IFI), and Cronbach alpha. These indices were used to assess the overall fit of the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to the data. Based on these evaluations, it was concluded that the model had a high degree of goodness of fit and matched well with the given data.
