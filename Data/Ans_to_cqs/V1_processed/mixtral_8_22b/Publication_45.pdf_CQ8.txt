The text does not explicitly mention where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it mentions that the dataset used in this study is available online (Seidl et al., 2015). Given that the authors emphasize providing a reproducible example including both code and data, it can be assumed that the code might also be available alongside the dataset or through another online platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Unfortunately, without more specific information from the given context, I cannot determine the exact location of the code repository.
