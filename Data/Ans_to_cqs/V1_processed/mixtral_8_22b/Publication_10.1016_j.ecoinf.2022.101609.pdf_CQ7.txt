The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training include creating training, test, and validation datasets. Training data is used for training the model, while validation data is used for selecting the model that performs best after verification with the test data. In cases where there is a class imbalance, it is recommended to randomize the dataset before splitting, known as stratification. However, for time series problems, this may not apply due to the sequential nature of the data.
