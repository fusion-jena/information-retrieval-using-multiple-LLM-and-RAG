In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does indicate that a dropout layer is included in the designed model structure. Dropout is a commonly used regularization technique in deep learning to prevent overfitting. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update, which helps to avoid complex co-adaptations on training data. By doing so, dropout improves the generalization ability of the model and reduces overfitting. Other common regularization methods include L1 and L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. These methods were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context but could also potentially be applied to improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting.
