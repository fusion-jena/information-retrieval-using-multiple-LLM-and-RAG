Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this research. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact link to the source code repository. However, it is common practice for researchers to share their code and models publicly, often through platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find the relevant code repository, consider searching for the authors' names or keywords related to the paper on these platforms. Alternatively, visit the authors' personal websites or contact them directly via email to request access to the code repository.
