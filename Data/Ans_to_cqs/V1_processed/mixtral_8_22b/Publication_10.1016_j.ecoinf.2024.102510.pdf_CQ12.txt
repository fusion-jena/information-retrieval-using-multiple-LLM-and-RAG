The pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the deep learning model. This can be seen from the table where different types of CNN architectures are listed such as MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, GoogleNet, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, ResNet18, InceptionResNetV2, and NASNetMobile. These are all popular CNN architectures used for image classification tasks.
