The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely used for detecting and identifying or classifying organisms in marine imagery. This is suggested by the mention of artificial intelligence being trialed and deployed to detect and identify/classify organisms in marine imagery, as well as the use of images and annotations as training data for developing these models. Additionally, there is a reference to the potential introduction of bias into identifications due to the biological community structure, which further supports the idea that the model may be used for identification or classification purposes.
