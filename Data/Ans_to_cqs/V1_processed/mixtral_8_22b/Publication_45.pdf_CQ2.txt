The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the general use of deep learning that various types of data formats could potentially be utilized depending on the nature of the problem being addressed. For instance, if the task involves image recognition or analysis, then image data would likely be employed. Similarly, if the task pertains to speech or sound processing, then audio files might be incorporated into the model. In the case of video analysis tasks, video data would naturally form part of the input dataset. Furthermore, structured datasets like those found in CSV format could also serve as inputs for certain problems. Therefore, without explicit information about the particular application discussed in the given context, we cannot definitively state what type of data format was used in this case.
