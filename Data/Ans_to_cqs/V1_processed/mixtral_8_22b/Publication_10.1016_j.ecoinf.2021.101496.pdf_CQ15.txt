Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated which optimization technique was used for the numerical optimization of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. However, it is mentioned that a random number generator was utilized during this process. This could suggest the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or another similar optimization algorithm that incorporates some form of randomness. Unfortunately, without additional details about the implementation of the ANN, we cannot definitively determine whether SGD, Adam, or any other specific optimization technique was employed.
