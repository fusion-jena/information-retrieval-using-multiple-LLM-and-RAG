Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the researchers likely followed common practices in machine learning, such as randomly splitting the dataset into training, testing, and validation subsets. Typically, the training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is employed to tune hyperparameters during the training process. Lastly, the testing set serves to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. In this case, the researchers mentioned using different numbers of training steps to optimize their TensorFlow models for various classification challenges. They also reported achieving high correct identification rates across multiple species, indicating successful model training and evaluation processes.
