According to the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using both validation and test sets separately to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters. However, the exact optimization technique such as grid search or random search is not explicitly mentioned in the context. It can be assumed that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed to achieve optimal results, but without further information, we cannot provide a more detailed explanation of the optimization process.
