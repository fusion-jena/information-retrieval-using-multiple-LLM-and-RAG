After reviewing the given context, it appears there isn't any explicit mention of specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization being employed to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some general practices can be observed from the information provided.

Firstly, the authors utilized a grid search technique to fine-tune the hyperparameters of their final model, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. This process helps optimize the model's performance by finding the most suitable combination of these parameters, thus potentially reducing overfitting.

Secondly, they implemented an active learning approach to improve the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model iteratively. Active learning involves selecting the most informative samples for labeling and adding them to the training set, allowing the model to learn more effectively from fewer examples. By focusing on the most valuable data points, this strategy can help mitigate overfitting.

Lastly, the authors mentioned that the CNN model performance stabilized after five active learning iterations, indicating that further training would not significantly improve its accuracy. This suggests that the model did not suffer from severe overfitting during the training process.

In conclusion, while the text does not explicitly state the use of common regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization, the application of grid search for hyperparameter tuning and the implementation of an active learning approach could contribute to preventing overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
