The text does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms used for predicting risk probabilities, including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, Generalized Boosted Model, Classification Tree Analyses, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, and Surface Response Envelope. To reduce uncertainty among models, an ensemble conflict risk model was constructed using weight averaging of these algorithms. This approach has been shown to produce more robust results compared to individual models. The predicted risk probabilities were then classified into five categories based on their values. While this process does not directly address data bias, it is important to note that proper handling of imbalanced datasets can be crucial in achieving accurate predictions. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can help mitigate data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
