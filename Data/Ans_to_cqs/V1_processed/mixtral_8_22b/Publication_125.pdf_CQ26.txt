In the given context, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information regarding the mentioned techniques to handle data imbalance or bias.

Stratified splitting is a method used to maintain the original class proportions when dividing the dataset into training and testing sets. It ensures that both subsets contain a representative distribution of classes.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets containing unequal numbers of observations per class. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling removes instances from the majority class. Both methods aim to create a balanced dataset for better performance.

Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from multiple sources or environments to ensure that the dataset represents different scenarios and reduces potential biases. By collecting diverse data, models can learn patterns applicable across various situations rather than being limited to specific conditions.

These techniques help mitigate data bias and improve the overall performance of deep learning models. However, it should be noted that these methods may not always guarantee complete elimination of bias, especially if the underlying cause is complex or unknown.
