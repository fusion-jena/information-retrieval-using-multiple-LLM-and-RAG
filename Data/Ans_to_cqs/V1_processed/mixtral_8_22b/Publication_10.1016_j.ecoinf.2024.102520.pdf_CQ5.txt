Based on the given context, it appears that the study does not use any of the commonly known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet for deep learning pipelines. Instead, the study utilizes remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) with Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m resolution. These satellite images are processed using geometric, radiometric, image mosaicking, and cropping techniques. Additionally, topographic variables like slope, aspect, drainage, and parent material are calculated using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis (SAGA) GIS. Therefore, the datasets used in this study primarily consist of satellite imagery and geospatial data rather than traditional machine learning datasets.
