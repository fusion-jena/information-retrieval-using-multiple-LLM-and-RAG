The experimental settings section mentions that the authors use a dataset of endemic bird species images. They have a total of 3,892 images, which they divide into three sets: one for training, another for validation, and the last for testing. Specifically, they use 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing. To increase the number of training samples and help their deep network converge better, they perform data augmentation on the training dataset, increasing it tenfold to 31,320 images. From these augmented images, they then use 25,056 (80%) for training and 6,264 (20%) for validation. However, the exact source or name of the dataset is not mentioned in the given text.
