The given context does not provide specific details regarding the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common methods include stratified splitting, where the dataset is divided into subsets ensuring each subset maintains the same proportions of class labels; oversampling, which involves duplicating examples from the minority class; undersampling, which reduces examples from the majority class; and diverse data collection, which aims to gather more representative samples. These techniques help mitigate imbalanced datasets and improve overall performance of machine learning algorithms.
