In this study, several techniques are employed to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. To tackle the challenge of imbalanced training datasets, oversampling is utilized. This technique involves creating duplicates of images from underrepresented classes to balance their representation in the dataset. It is important to note that oversampling is only applied to the training dataset and not the validation dataset to avoid overestimating the model's learning progress. Additionally, stratified splitting is implemented to maintain the same distribution of classes in both the training and validation datasets.

Furthermore, to prevent overfitting caused by having very similar pictures in the training and validation datasets, images from different days are included in these sets. Data augmentation procedures are also adopted to artificially increase the sample size by applying transformations to an existing set of learning methods such as CNN. This helps enhance the generalization capabilities of the model. Lastly, diverse data collection is emphasized to ensure that the training dataset captures a wide range of contexts that the CNN is required for. This includes photographing animals across different times of the day and varying lighting conditions.
