Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, or validation. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning models to divide the dataset into these subsets. Typically, the dataset is randomly divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set.

The training set is used to fit the model, meaning the weights and biases of the network are adjusted during backpropagation to minimize the loss function. The validation set is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model and prevent overfitting. It provides an unbiased evaluation of the model while tuning its parameters. Lastly, the testing set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model.

While the exact percentages may vary depending on the size of the dataset and other factors, a commonly used ratio is 80% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 10% for the testing set.
