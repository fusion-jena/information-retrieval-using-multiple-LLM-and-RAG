The information provided does not explicitly mention specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses the use of a large number of manually validated recordings for both S2 and S3 songs, ranging from 30 to 400 validations. Additionally, there is a reference to 32,640 unvalidated recordings. These recordings could potentially serve as input data for the deep learning models mentioned in Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020). Nevertheless, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively stated that these recordings correspond directly to well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
