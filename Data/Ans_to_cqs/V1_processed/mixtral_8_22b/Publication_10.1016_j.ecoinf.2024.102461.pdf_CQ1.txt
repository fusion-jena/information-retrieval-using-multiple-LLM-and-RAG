The paper does not provide information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several ways to collect raw data for deep learning models, including but not limited to:

* Surveys or questionnaires: These can be used to gather structured or unstructured data from individuals or groups.
* Sensors: Various types of sensors such as cameras, microphones, temperature sensors, etc., can be used to capture real-time data.
* Public datasets: There are numerous publicly available datasets that can be used for training deep learning models. Examples include ImageNet, CIFAR-10, COCO, etc.
* Web scraping: This involves extracting data from websites or other online sources.
* APIs: Application Programming Interfaces allow developers to access data from various platforms and services.

Again, it should be noted that these methods are general and may not apply specifically to the research presented in the paper.
