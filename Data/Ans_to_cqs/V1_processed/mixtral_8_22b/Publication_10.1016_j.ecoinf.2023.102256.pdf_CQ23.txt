From the given context, it appears that the authors have not explicitly mentioned any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, they did conduct ten independent executions of their experiments and reported average evaluation measures, which could help assess the robustness and consistency of their model's performance. Additionally, they used a multi-branch CNN architecture to incorporate additional information into the model, which might contribute to its ability to handle different types of data and improve its overall generalization capabilities. Nonetheless, without explicit mention of these techniques, one cannot definitively state whether they were employed to ensure the model's generalizability.
