The paper does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that they used four real-life datasets, including the sparrow population dataset, but there is no mention of where these datasets were obtained or stored. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
