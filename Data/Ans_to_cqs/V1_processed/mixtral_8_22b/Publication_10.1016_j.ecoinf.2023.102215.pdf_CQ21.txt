After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task. Based on the provided context, here are some possible postprocessing steps for the described model:

1. Saliency Map Generation: During the training process, the model generates multiple saliency maps at different levels. These saliency maps highlight important regions or features within the input data. After training, these saliency maps can be used for further analysis or visualization purposes.

2. Final Predicted Saliency Map: Once the model has been fully trained, it produces a final predicted saliency map (Sp_re). This map represents the most significant areas or features identified by the model. It can be used for tasks such as object detection, segmentation, or anomaly detection.

3. Loss Function Calculation: To measure the performance of the model during training, a loss function is employed. In this case, the binary cross-entropy loss function is utilized for both the multi-level saliency maps and the final predicted saliency map. By comparing the ground truth labels with the predicted output, the loss value indicates how well the model is performing.

4. Evaluation Metrics: To assess the overall effectiveness of the model, various evaluation metrics can be calculated. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. Depending on the specific application, appropriate metrics should be chosen to accurately reflect the model's performance.

5. Comparative Analysis: A comparative analysis can be conducted to compare the performance of the proposed model against state-of-the-art methods (SOTAs). This helps determine whether the new model outperforms existing solutions in terms of accuracy, speed, computational complexity, etc.

6. Time and Computational Performance: An assessment of the total training time, average inference time, model parameters, and floating point operations (FLOPs) can provide insights into the time and computational efficiency of the model. This information is crucial when deploying the model in real-world applications where resource constraints might exist.
