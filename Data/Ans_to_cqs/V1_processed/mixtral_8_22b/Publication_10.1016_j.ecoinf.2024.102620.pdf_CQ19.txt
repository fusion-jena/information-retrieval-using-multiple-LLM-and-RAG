Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state which specific deep learning framework was used to build the models mentioned in the text. The PLUS model utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, but this is not a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the usage of TensorFlow or PyTorch in building these models.
