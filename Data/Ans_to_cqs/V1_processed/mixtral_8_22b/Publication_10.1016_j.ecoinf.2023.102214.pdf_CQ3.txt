The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the project had access to 359 sightings of snow leopards at hourly intervals, yielding 22,120 annotations. These annotations were described as machine learning-detected bounding boxes around snow leopards in photos. Therefore, one can infer that bounding box annotation was used as part of the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, the text also refers to the use of a computer vision model based on machine learning, which suggests that image classification may have been employed as well.
