Unfortunately, there isn't enough information in the given context to determine what specific type of deep learning model is being used in the proposed pipeline. While the text does mention deep learning, it doesn't provide any details about the particular models or architectures employed. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer whether the pipeline uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, or another type of deep learning model.
