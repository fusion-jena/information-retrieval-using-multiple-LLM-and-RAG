The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS). The ROC scores obtained were greater than 0.94, indicating a good overall model fit. The TSS values ranged between 0.739 and 0.838, which also indicated a good fit to the model. In the pre-modeling test, the mean AUC values varied with the SE and GE from 0.850 to 0.928 for different species. These metrics are used to measure the accuracy and precision of the model.
