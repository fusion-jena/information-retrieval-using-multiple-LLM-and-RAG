To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on specific criteria such as class labels. This ensures that each subset maintains the original class distribution, preventing any skew in the data. It helps in creating balanced training and validation sets, which can improve the model's ability to learn patterns across various classes.

Oversampling is another method used to tackle data imbalance issues. It involves duplicating samples from minority classes to match the size of majority classes. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one popular oversampling algorithm that generates synthetic samples instead of simply copying existing ones. This prevents overfitting due to repeated instances.

Undersampling, conversely, reduces the number of samples in majority classes to equalize them with minority classes. Random Under Sampler (RUS) is a common undersampling technique where random samples from the majority class are removed until they reach parity with the minority class. However, this might lead to loss of valuable information.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial for reducing bias in deep learning pipelines. A wide range of sources should be utilized to gather varied representations of the target population. This includes considering factors like age, gender, ethnicity, etc., depending upon the application domain. Enriching the dataset with diverse samples improves the robustness and fairness of the trained models.

In the given context, data augmentation was used to modify class balance by increasing the number of examples for underrepresented classes. This technique expands the dataset without acquiring additional data, allowing for the training of larger networks and balancing the data. Transformations applied to existing data generate new images that maintain the same class but differ slightly. This enables all classes to be learned uniformly, addressing potential biases caused by unbalanced training sets.
