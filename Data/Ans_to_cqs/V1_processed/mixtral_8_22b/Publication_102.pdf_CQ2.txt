Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipelines discussed primarily use image data. Both datasets mentioned, namely the SSLs' dataset and the elephants' dataset, consist of images. These images are used for tasks such as encoding, compression, and object counting within the context of various deep learning models like feed-forward regression networks, CCNN, ResNeXt, and UNet models. However, there is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV being utilized in these specific deep learning pipelines.
