The text does not provide explicit information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Google Earth Engine platform was used to access various remote sensing data sets such as MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI, CDR AVHRR NDVI, and third-generation GIMMS NDVI. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine whether the deep learning model was deployed using any of the mentioned platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
