The given context does not provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and noise injection. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and can also prevent overfitting by providing more diverse examples during training. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset. For example, flipping may not be suitable for datasets with asymmetric objects or scenes, while rotation might not be appropriate for datasets containing text or other orientation-dependent elements. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider the suitability of each data augmentation technique for a particular task before applying them.
