The given text does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can share some general knowledge regarding common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

1. Bounding Box Annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects within an image or video frame. The coordinates of these boxes are then stored along with their respective labels. This approach is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. Instance Segmentation: Unlike bounding box annotation, instance segmentation provides pixel-wise labeling of each individual object within an image. This results in precise delineation of object boundaries, making it suitable for applications requiring accurate object localization.

3. Semantic Segmentation: In contrast to instance segmentation, semantic segmentation focuses on categorizing every pixel into a particular class without distinguishing between instances of the same class. This technique is often used for scene understanding tasks such as autonomous driving.

4. Polygon Annotation: Similar to bounding box annotation, polygon annotation involves outlining objects using vertices instead of rectangles. This method offers better precision when dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

5. Landmark/Key Point Annotation: Used mainly for facial recognition and pose estimation tasks, landmark annotation involves marking specific points on an object or person. These key points help define the shape and orientation of the subject matter.

6. Image Classification: A simpler form of annotation where entire images are labeled based on their content. This technique is widely used for training models to recognize broad categories like animals, vehicles, etc.
