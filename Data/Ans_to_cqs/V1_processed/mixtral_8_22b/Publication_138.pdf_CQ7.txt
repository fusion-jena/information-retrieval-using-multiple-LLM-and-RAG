Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, typically, datasets are divided into training, testing, and sometimes validation sets using various methods such as random splitting or stratified sampling. These splits help evaluate the performance of the model during training and prevent overfitting. In some cases, cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation may also be employed. Unfortunately, without specific details regarding the dataset and methodology used in this case, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
