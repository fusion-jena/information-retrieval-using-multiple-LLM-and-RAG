The article does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, common strategies include setting a fixed random seed value before training the model to ensure reproducibility, using cross-validation to evaluate model performance across different subsets of data, and employing ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to reduce variance and improve generalization.
