Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets contain images and their corresponding labels, which are often used for training and testing various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Without further context or information, it cannot be determined which dataset was used in this particular study.
