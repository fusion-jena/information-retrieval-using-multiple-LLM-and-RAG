The text does not provide any direct information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it discusses various aspects related to ecology and forest management, including sampling techniques, diversity indices, and estimation methods like NN1 and NN2. These topics do not seem to be connected to the concept of regularization in machine learning.
