Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it discusses the use of neural networks, specifically Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), in hyperspectral data analysis. It also mentions the structure of MLP consisting of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Additionally, it provides details about hyperparameter tuning ranges and the optimal MLP architecture and parameters. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
