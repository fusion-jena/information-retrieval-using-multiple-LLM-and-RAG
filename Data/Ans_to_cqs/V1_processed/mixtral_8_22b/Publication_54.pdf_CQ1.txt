The paper does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they use a dataset of 27 endemic bird species for the source domain and another dataset of newly added endemic bird species for the target domain. It can be assumed that these datasets could have been collected through various means such as field observations, camera traps, audio recordings, or publicly available databases. Nevertheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods were employed for gathering the raw data.
