The given context does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, we can infer some possible steps taken during the deployment phase.

After training the model using PyTorch, it would typically be saved or serialized into a file format such as.pt or.pth. This allows the model architecture, weights, and other parameters to be stored and loaded later for inference purposes.

As for platform selection, there are various options available depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some popular choices include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, which offer services for hosting and managing machine learning models. Alternatively, custom solutions could also be developed using tools like Flask or Django for creating web applications that utilize the trained model for predictions.

In summary, while the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not mentioned in the provided context, it likely involved saving the model using PyTorch's built-in functionality and then selecting an appropriate platform for hosting and serving predictions.
