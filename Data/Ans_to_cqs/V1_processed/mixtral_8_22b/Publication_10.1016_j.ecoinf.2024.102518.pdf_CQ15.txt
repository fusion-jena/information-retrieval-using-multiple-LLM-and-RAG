The text does not provide explicit information about specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it mentions the use of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, which is often used in species distribution modeling. This method involves optimizing a function to find the probability distribution that maximizes entropy subject to constraints based on observed data. Regularization methods are also mentioned, specifically setting the regularization multiplier from 0.5 to 5, which helps prevent overfitting during the optimization process. Additionally, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is utilized to select the best tuning parameters, which is a common technique for model selection in statistical learning.
