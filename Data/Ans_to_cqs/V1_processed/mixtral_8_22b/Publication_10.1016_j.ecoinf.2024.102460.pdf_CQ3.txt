Based on the given context, there is no direct information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for solving prediction problems related to time series data. Deep learning models often require large amounts of labeled data for training, which could involve various annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation depending on the nature of the task. But without explicit details regarding the dataset preparation or preprocessing steps, we cannot definitively state what data annotation techniques were employed in this particular study.
