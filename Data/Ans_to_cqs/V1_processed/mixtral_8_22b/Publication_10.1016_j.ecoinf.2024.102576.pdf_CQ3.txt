Based on the given context, it appears that the study uses a deep learning approach for land monitoring, specifically focusing on PCF (Pheno-Climatological Features) land. While the text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques employed in their deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the importance of labeling data for training the U-Net model, a type of CNN.

Labeling data is essential for supervised learning tasks such as those performed by the U-Net model. Labeled data helps the model learn patterns and relationships between input features and output labels. Although the context does not provide details about the exact annotation methods used, common techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help create labeled datasets required for training deep learning models like the U-Net model mentioned in this case.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within images to identify them. Semantic segmentation entails assigning a class or category to every pixel in an image, whereas instance segmentation differentiates individual instances of objects belonging to the same class. Given the focus on land monitoring and the utilization of satellite imagery, it is plausible that the researchers might have used one or more of these annotation techniques to prepare their dataset for training the deep learning model.
