The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, based on common practices in machine learning, one can infer that either grid search or random search might have been used. Grid search involves trying out different combinations of hyperparameter values within a predefined range, while random search randomly selects combinations of hyperparameter values within a given range. Both methods aim to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that minimize error or maximize performance. Without specific details mentioned in the text, we cannot definitively state whether grid search or random search was employed.
