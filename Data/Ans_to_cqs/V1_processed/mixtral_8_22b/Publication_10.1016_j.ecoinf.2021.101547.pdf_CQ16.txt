Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, common practices in machine learning include monitoring metrics such as validation loss or accuracy during training. When these metrics reach a plateau or stop improving significantly, it can be considered as an indication that further training might not yield substantial improvements. This concept is often referred to as early stopping. Additionally, another criterion could be reaching a predetermined maximum number of epochs or iterations. It's important to note that these criteria are general guidelines and the optimal point to stop training can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.
