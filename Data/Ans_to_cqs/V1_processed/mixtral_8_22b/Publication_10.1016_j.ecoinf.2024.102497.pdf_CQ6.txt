Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. While the exact steps may vary depending on the dataset and problem at hand, some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Normalization: This involves rescaling the input features so they fall within a certain range, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. This is often done to prevent any one feature from dominating the others during training.
2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the scale of the input features. However, instead of rescaling them to a fixed range, scaling aims to bring all features to a similar magnitude. This can help improve convergence speed during training.
3. Cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant or redundant information from the dataset. This could include removing missing values, outliers, or duplicates. It can also involve encoding categorical variables into numerical form if necessary.
4. Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. This could include taking ratios, differences, or other mathematical operations on the original features.
5. Augmentation: This involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, or flips to the existing samples. This can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.
