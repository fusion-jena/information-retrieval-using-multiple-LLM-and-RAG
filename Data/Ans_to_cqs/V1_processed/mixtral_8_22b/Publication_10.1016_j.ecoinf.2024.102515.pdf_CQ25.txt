Based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, considering the overall theme of the passage, it can be inferred that the deep learning model could potentially be used for image recognition tasks such as classification, segmentation, or object detection. Specifically, the authors mention that training an image recognition model using deep learning techniques would be beneficial if the methodology were expanded to cover larger geographic areas and more languages, leading to an increased volume of data. Given these clues, it can be assumed that the intended application of the deep learning model is related to analyzing images associated with tweets, possibly to extract additional biodiversity-related information or improve the accuracy of identifying relevant content within the tweets.
