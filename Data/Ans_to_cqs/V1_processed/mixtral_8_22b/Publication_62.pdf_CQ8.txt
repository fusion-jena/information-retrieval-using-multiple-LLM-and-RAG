The code used to define and train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) mentioned in the given context can be found in the authors' Mathematica notebooks. However, it appears that the code repositories are not publicly available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Instead, they have been shared as supplementary materials alongside the research paper.

There are four relevant supplementary materials listed:

1. Suppl. material 1: Notebook used to define and train the unstained/stained CNN.
   Authors: Paul B. Frandsen, Abel Brown
   Data type: Mathematica notebook
   Filename: stained\_unstained\_RGB256.nb

2. Suppl. material 2: Annotated notebook used to define and train the unstained/stained CNN.
   Authors: Paul B. Frandsen, Abel Brown
   Data type: PDF
   Filename: stained\_unstained\_RGB256.pdf

3. Suppl. material 3: Notebook used to define and train the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN.
   Authors: Paul B. Frandsen, Abel Brown
   Data type: Mathematica notebook
   Filename: clubmoss\_spikemoss\_RGB256.nb

4. Suppl. material 4: Annotated notebook used to define and train the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN.
   Authors: Paul B. Frandsen, Abel Brown
   Data type: PDF
   Filename: clubmoss\_spikemoss\_RGB256.pdf

To access the code repositories, one would need to download the respective files from the links provided in the supplementary materials section. Unfortunately, I cannot provide direct links since this information was not included in the given context.
