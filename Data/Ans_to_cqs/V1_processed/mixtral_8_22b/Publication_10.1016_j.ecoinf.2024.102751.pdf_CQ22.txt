The text does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models; however, it discusses the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a predictive model. The mentioned metrics are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R2 score. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate regression tasks rather than classification tasks where accuracy, precision, and recall might be used. In summary, the discussed model uses MAE, RMSE, and R2 score as evaluation metrics instead of accuracy, precision, or recall.
