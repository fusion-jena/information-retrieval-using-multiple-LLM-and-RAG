To address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets such that each set maintains the same distribution of target variables as the original dataset. This ensures that the model does not overfit or underfit due to imbalanced data.

Oversampling is a technique where synthetic samples are created from minority classes to balance the dataset. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards majority classes. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from majority classes to achieve balanced datasets. However, it may lead to loss of valuable information.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset represents all possible scenarios. This reduces the chances of having a biased dataset and improves the generalizability of the model.

These techniques help mitigate data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, ensuring accurate predictions and improved performance.
