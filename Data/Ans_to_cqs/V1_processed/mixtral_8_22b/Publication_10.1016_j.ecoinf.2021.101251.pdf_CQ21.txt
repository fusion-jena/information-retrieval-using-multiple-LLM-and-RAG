I apologize, but there doesn't seem to be any direct mention of postprocessing steps related to machine learning models such as saliency maps, metrics calculations, or confusion matrices within the given context. However, it does discuss some aspects of data management and publication which could potentially involve similar concepts. For instance, once data has been submitted to a repository, it may go through review and then be assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), along with automated citations. This could be seen as somewhat analogous to the evaluation phase of a machine learning pipeline where various performance metrics might be calculated. Additionally, the concept of data papers, which provide detailed context and discussion around datasets, could be likened to the use of visualization tools like saliency maps to better understand the behavior of trained models. But again, please note that these are not explicit parallels drawn from the text itself.
