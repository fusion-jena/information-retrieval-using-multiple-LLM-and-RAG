The paper does not provide information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the proposed framework integrates missing or inaccurate data from heterogeneous sources to enhance forecasting accuracy of the developed model. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the implementation of the framework using the REVIS system, which focuses on monitoring and predicting pollutant concentration levels on UK highways. Therefore, it can be assumed that the dataset used in this case would consist of environmental data related to pollution levels on highways.
