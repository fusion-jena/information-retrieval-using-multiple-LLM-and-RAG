The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves setting an initial learning rate and then automatically adjusting it to find the optimal point for the best performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Additionally, the early stopping option is used to halt the model training when the validation accuracy cannot be further improved. This approach ensures that the model does not overfit or underfit the data by continuously monitoring its performance throughout the training process.
