The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions two types of annotations: high-quality annotations and moderate to low-quality annotations. These could refer to various annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Additionally, the study discusses using a combination of self-supervised learning and hand-annotated data, suggesting that both automated and manual annotation methods were employed.
