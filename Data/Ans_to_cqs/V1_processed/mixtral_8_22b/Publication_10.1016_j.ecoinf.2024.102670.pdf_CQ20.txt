The given context does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the text. Therefore, I cannot determine which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models.

The context discusses various aspects related to deep learning methods, such as the difficulty in obtaining sufficient ground truth data, using crowd-sourcing for manual annotations, developing a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model, and comparing its performance against other methods. However, there is no mention of any specific hardware resources used for training these deep learning models.
