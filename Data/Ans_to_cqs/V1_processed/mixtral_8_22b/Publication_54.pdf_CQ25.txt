The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated as either classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the primary goal of the model is to classify endemic bird species. This is evident from the statement that the model aims to "train and learn the features of 27 endemic bird species" and then transfer these learned features to a second target network to train a newly added dataset on endemic bird species. Additionally, the fact that the authors mention using the Inception-ResNet-v2 model, which is commonly used for image classification tasks, further supports this conclusion.
