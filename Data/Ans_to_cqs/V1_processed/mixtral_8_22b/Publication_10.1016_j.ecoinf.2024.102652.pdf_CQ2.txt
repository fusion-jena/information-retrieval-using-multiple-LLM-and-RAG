Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses remote sensing images as input data. Specifically, the study mentions using a 5-band multispectral image and adding five salinity indices to increase the total number of bands. Additionally, the study refers to applying a deep learning modified U-NET algorithm to these images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is primarily image data.
