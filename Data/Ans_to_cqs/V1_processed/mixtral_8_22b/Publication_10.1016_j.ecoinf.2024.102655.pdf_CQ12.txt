The given context does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that machine learning models were applied and that intelligent models based on extreme learning machines were proposed for water quality index predictions. However, it does not specify whether any deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), or transformers were utilized. Therefore, I cannot determine which type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline based on the provided context.
