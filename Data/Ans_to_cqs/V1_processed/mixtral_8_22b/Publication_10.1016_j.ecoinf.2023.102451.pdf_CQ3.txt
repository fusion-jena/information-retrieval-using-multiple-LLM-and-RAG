Based on the provided context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, we can infer that the dataset used for training and testing the proposed model consists of microscopic images of environmental microorganisms. These images were likely labeled according to their respective classes, as the task involves multi-class classification of environmental microbes. Therefore, it can be assumed that some form of image labeling was employed during the data preparation phase. Unfortunately, without further information about the exact nature of these labels or how they were assigned, I cannot provide a more detailed response regarding the specific data annotation techniques utilized in this study.
