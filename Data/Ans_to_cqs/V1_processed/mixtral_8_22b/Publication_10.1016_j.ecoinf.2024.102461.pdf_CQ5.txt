The given context does not provide information about specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses using diverse remote sensing data characterized by high spatial resolution, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images with multispectral bands, and Landsat 8 satellite images. These datasets could potentially be used in a deep learning pipeline for creating fire risk maps in forest ecosystems. The research also mentions employing various modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression to refine these maps.

Based on the available context, we cannot determine the exact datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. Still, they likely utilized remote sensing data from UAV and satellite imagery to train their models.
