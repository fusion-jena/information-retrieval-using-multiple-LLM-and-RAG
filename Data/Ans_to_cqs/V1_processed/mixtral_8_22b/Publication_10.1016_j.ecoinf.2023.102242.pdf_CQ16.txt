The provided context does not directly address the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it can be inferred from the context that the focus of future research should be on refining the subsequent classification process to yield more reliable results. This suggests that the completion of training might depend on achieving satisfactory performance metrics or reaching a certain level of reliability in the classification model.

The cited papers discuss various aspects of data processing and classification methods related to remote sensing images. For instance, Li et al. (2019) explore temporal stages and method selection for species classification using GF-2 remote sensing images. Similarly, Ma (2014) investigates object-based remote sensing image classification of forests based on multi-level segmentation. These studies indicate that the choice of appropriate methods and techniques plays a crucial role in improving the accuracy and efficiency of the classification process.

In terms of determining when training is complete, one common approach is monitoring the validation loss during the training phase. A validation loss plateau occurs when the validation loss stops decreasing significantly over several epochs, indicating that the model has learned most of the patterns present in the training data. At this point, further training may lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data. Therefore, observing a validation loss plateau could serve as a criterion for deciding when to stop training.

However, it is essential to note that relying solely on validation loss plateaus might not always provide the best indication of when training should be stopped. Other factors, such as the learning rate schedule, regularization techniques, and early stopping strategies, also play significant roles in optimizing the training process and preventing overfitting. Ultimately, the decision to halt training depends on the specific requirements and goals of each project, including the desired balance between bias and variance, computational resources, and time constraints.
