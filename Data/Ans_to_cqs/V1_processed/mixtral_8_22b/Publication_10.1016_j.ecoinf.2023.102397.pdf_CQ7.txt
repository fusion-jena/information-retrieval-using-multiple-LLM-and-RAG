The context does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, based on common practices in machine learning, it can be inferred that the data might have been randomly divided into these subsets. Typically, around 70-80% of the data is allocated for training, while the remaining 20-30% is further divided between testing and validation sets. This division allows the model to learn from the majority of the data during training, while also providing separate datasets for tuning hyperparameters and assessing the final model's performance.
