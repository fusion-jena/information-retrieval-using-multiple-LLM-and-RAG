The paper uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), for its deep learning approach. This model is chosen due to its ability to address issues such as gradient vanishing and explosion in traditional RNNs when dealing with long-term sequences. The LSTM model has a unique memory unit composed of a forget gate, input gate, output gate, and hidden layer, allowing it to precisely control information flow through these gates. As a result, this model is effective for learning from long time sequences and is suitable for time series predictions.
