The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it is used for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping. This involves classifying different types of land use or land cover categories such as urban areas, forests, water bodies, agricultural lands, etc. The specific type of deep learning model mentioned here is the Random Forest (RF) classifier, which is known for its robustness against noise and lower sensitivity to tuning parameters. It has been shown to perform well in various applications related to LULC mapping, including crop mapping and undersampling techniques. Additionally, the text mentions the use of multiple probabilistic classification methods and space-spectrum arrays, suggesting that these might also play a role in the deep learning model's function.
