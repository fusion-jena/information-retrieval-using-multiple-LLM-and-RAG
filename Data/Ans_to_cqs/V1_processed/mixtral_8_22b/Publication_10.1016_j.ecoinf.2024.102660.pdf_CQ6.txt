Before training a deep learning model such as the Res_AUNet network mentioned in the given context, several preprocessing steps may be involved. However, the specific preprocessing steps applied can vary depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the model. In this case, the context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Instead, it focuses more on the data preparation aspect, which involves acquiring and labeling the Water Sun Glint Dataset (WSGD) consisting of UAV water images.

Nevertheless, some general preprocessing steps often employed when working with image datasets include resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. From the context, we can infer that the acquired images were resized to a uniform size of 256 x 256 pixels, which could be considered a form of preprocessing. Furthermore, during the network training process, the input images underwent random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance the network's robustness. Image augmentation techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

However, without additional information, it remains uncertain whether other common preprocessing steps like normalization or cleaning were performed on the dataset prior to training the Res_AUNet network.
