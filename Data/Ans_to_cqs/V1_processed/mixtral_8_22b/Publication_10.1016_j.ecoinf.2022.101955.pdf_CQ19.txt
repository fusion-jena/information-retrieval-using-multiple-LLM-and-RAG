The text does not provide information about the specific frameworks or libraries used to build the deep learning models. However, it mentions the use of the "nnet" package for implementing the Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. This suggests that the authors might have used R programming language since "nnet" is a popular machine learning library available in R. Unfortunately, without more explicit details regarding the implementation, it cannot be confirmed if other frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch were also utilized.
