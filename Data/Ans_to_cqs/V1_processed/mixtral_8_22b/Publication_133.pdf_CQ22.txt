The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as recall, precision, and average precision. Recall is defined as the proportion of expert-labeled objects that were also labeled by the deep learning model. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. Precision is the fraction of correctly classified objects among all classified objects. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. Average precision is used as a single model-performance metric, taking into account the trade-off between precision and recall. It ranges between 0 and 1, with an ideal predictive model having an average precision of 1.
