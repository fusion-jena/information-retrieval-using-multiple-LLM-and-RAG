Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain practices were followed to improve the robustness and reliability of the model.

Firstly, the authors mention that they used vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of their sampling plots. This suggests that they aimed to capture the diversity of vegetation within each boundary, which could help improve the generalizability of the model. By collecting training and validation points from these diverse areas, the model would have been exposed to a more comprehensive range of features, potentially improving its ability to perform well on unseen data.

Secondly, the authors state that they created several small sampling plots within each vegetation type rather than using one large area. This approach may have helped increase the efficiency of the sampling process while still maintaining representativeness across different vegetation types. Smaller sampling plots might also encourage greater variability in the collected data, further contributing to the model's generalizability.

Lastly, although not directly related to the deep learning model, the authors discuss how their results can be used as a baseline for future LULC analyses performed with other methodologies, including deep learning CNN. This implies that the authors recognize the importance of comparing and validating their findings against alternative approaches, which is another way to assess the generalizability of their model indirectly.

In conclusion, based on the available information, it appears that the authors took some measures to enhance the generalizability of their deep learning model, such as capturing diverse vegetation types and employing multiple smaller sampling plots. However, explicit details regarding techniques like cross-validation, stratified splitting, or creating a diverse dataset are not mentioned in the provided context.
