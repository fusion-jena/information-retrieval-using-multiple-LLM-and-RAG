The completion of training for the deep learning model in this study is determined by monitoring the validation loss during the training process. As shown in Figure 2, the validation loss stabilizes after 30 epochs, indicating that further training might lead to overfitting. Therefore, the deep learning model generated by 30 training epochs was used for tests. Additionally, the model's average precision (AP) over the three insect classes improves with the number of training epochs, providing another perspective on the gradually improving performance of the model.
