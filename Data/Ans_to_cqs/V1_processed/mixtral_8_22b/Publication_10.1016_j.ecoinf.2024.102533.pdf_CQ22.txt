The text does not explicitly mention any deep learning models or their performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it discusses three metrics used to evaluate the performance of the K-means clustering algorithm: Distortion, Silhouette, and Calinski-Harabasz. Distortion measures the sum of squared distances of data to their nearest cluster centers, indicating the goodness of cluster cohesion. A lower distortion score suggests better cluster cohesiveness. The Silhouette index computes the similarity of each point to others in the same cluster compared to those in different clusters. Lastly, the Calinski-Harabasz index determines the ratio of dispersion between and within clusters.
