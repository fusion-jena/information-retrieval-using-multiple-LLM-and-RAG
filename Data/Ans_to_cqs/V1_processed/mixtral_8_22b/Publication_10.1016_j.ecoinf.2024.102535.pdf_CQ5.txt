Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to determine the exact dataset(s) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the dataset consists of seabed images, specifically related to hydrothermal vent environments, since the goal is to perform substratum classification in these areas. Additionally, the text mentions that the performance metrics were designed to address the challenges of monitoring and better understanding the spatial distribution of fauna and substrata in the deep sea. Therefore, while I cannot provide the name of the dataset(s), they likely consist of labeled seabed images relevant to hydrothermal vent environments.
