Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various aspects of deep learning in remote sensing applications, including a review of relevant literature and methodologies. It also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in processing remote sensing data.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of datasets and improve model performance. These techniques include image transformations like flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and translating images. While these specific techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, they could potentially be part of the deep learning pipeline discussed here.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state the application of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling, these techniques are often utilized in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing applications. Therefore, it is plausible that similar techniques might have been implemented in this case.
