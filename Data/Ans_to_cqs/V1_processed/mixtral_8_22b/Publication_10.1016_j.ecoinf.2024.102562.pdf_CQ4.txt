In the given context, several data augmentation techniques were employed in the deep learning pipeline. These include multiplying images, applying linear contrast, sharpening, embossing, flipping horizontally and vertically, rotating, and using affine transformations. Specifically, these techniques were utilized during the training of the same dataset with the ResNet-101 network for 500 epochs. The selection of image augmentations was deemed crucial to improving training performance. Notably, the mentioned techniques were used for heavy augmentation.
