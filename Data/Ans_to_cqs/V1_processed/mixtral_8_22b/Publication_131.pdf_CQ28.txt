The given information does not provide details about which specific cloud platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the implementation was done on a workstation with an AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor, 32GB RAM, and GPU NVIDIA Quadro P620, running Windows 10 Pro. It also states that a Python application was created to train the CNN based on a chosen dataset. Therefore, we can infer that the deployment might have been done locally rather than on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
