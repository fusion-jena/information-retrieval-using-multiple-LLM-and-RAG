Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that data augmentation might have been employed due to its common usage in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. Commonly used data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the diversity of the dataset without collecting new data. It should be noted that the actual data augmentation techniques used would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
