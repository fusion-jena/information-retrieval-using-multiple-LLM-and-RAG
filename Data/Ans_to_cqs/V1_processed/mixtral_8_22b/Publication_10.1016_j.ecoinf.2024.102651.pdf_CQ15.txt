Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined what optimization techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), etc.
