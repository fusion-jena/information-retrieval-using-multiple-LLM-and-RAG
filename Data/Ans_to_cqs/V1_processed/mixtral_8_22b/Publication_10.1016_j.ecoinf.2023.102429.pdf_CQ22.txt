The performance of the deep learning model can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc. However, based on the given context, it seems like we are discussing the evaluation of models for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) using visible near-infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy. The accuracy of these models is assessed by four parameters, namely, coefficient of determination (R^2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ). The model is considered accurate when the bias is close to zero. RPD corresponds to the ratio of standard deviation (SD) to RMSE, which is widely used to evaluate VNIR spectral models. RPIQ considers prediction errors and variations in observations simultaneously, providing a more objective and easily comparable measure of model validity in model validation studies and has no assumptions about the distribution of observations. Based on the given context, it appears that the SVMR model outperformed the PLSR model in terms of R^2 and RMSE values for both SOC and TN estimation. Additionally, the SVMR model with SG smoothing and FD or SD achieved the best prediction accuracy for SOC and TN concentrations.
