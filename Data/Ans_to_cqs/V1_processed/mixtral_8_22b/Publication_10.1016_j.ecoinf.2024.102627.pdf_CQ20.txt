The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions using the French National High Performance Computing Centre (IDRIS), which suggests that high-performance computing resources were utilized for training the model. Without further context, we cannot determine the exact type of hardware resources employed.
