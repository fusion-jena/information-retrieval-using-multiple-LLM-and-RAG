The purpose of the deep learning model used in the study by Huang et al. (2019) is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, based on the title of their paper ("Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning"), it can be inferred that the deep learning model might have been employed for tasks such as image classification or semantic segmentation. These tasks could help identify and categorize various features within the images, which would then aid in monitoring changes in ecosystem services over time. Nevertheless, without further information, this remains speculative.
