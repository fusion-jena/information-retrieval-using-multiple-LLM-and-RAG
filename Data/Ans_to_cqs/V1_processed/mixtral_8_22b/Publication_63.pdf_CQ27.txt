The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the models were built using the Keras API and TensorFlow backend in R, and the training was conducted on a workstation with NVIDIA GPUs. It can be inferred that once the models were trained and evaluated, they could have been saved or serialized for later use. This is often done using functions like'save_weights()' or'save_model()' in Keras. The choice of platform for deployment would depend on various factors such as the intended application, computational resources, and accessibility requirements. For instance, if the model needs to be integrated into a web application, Flask or Django in Python might be suitable platforms. Alternatively, if real-time predictions are required, platforms like TensorFlow Serving or Nvidia's Triton Inference Server could be considered. However, without specific details about the deployment process, these suggestions remain speculative.
