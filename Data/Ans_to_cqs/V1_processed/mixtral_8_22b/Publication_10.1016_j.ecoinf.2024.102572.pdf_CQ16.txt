Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about the completion criteria for training, such as reaching a validation loss plateau. However, we can infer from the context that the authors have performed various analyses and calculations related to wildfires, including fire severity, combustion efficiency, and calculating processing datasets. They also mentioned using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to create a thorough time series dataset containing land cover types, wildfire locations, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and above-ground biomass data in mainland China.

In this case, since no specific details regarding the completion criteria for training are available, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given context. It would be best to refer to additional resources or consult with domain experts to obtain accurate information on this topic.
