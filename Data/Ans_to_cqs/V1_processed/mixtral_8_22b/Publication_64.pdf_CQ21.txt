The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, here are some general postprocessing steps that may be applicable:

1. Evaluation metrics: These include calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, AUC scores, etc., depending on the problem type (classification, regression, object detection, etc.).

2. Confusion matrices: These are often used for visualizing the performance of a classification model. They show the number of correct and incorrect predictions broken down by each class.

3. Saliency maps: These highlight the regions in the input image that contribute the most towards the final prediction made by the model. They help understand which parts of the image were important for making the decision.

4. Data analysis: This involves analyzing the distribution of predicted classes, identifying any biases, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

5. Hyperparameter tuning: Based on the initial evaluation, hyperparameters of the model may need to be adjusted to improve performance further.

6. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models to create an ensemble can sometimes lead to better overall performance compared to individual models.

Without knowing the exact nature of the task and the specific requirements, it is difficult to determine which postprocessing steps would be relevant in this case.
