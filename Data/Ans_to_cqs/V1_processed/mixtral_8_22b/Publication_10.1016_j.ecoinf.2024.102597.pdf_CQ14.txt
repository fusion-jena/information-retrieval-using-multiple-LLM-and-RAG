The hyperparameters of the model are optimised using two methods: the random grid search and Bayesian optimisation. These methods are implemented using GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn and the Hyperopt library (version 0.2.7), respectively. After selecting the best parameters for each model, their performances are then compared.
