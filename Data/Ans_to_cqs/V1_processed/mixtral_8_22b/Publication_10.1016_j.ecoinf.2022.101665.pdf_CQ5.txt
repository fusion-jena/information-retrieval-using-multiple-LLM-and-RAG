The query asks about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, but based on the given context, there is no mention of any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context discusses the use of various environmental variables and Earth observation imagery for producing maps through machine learning approaches. These include cosine of slope aspect, sine of slope aspect, slope, topographic position index, terrain ruggedness index, topographic wetness index, forest height, X coordinate, Y coordinate, distance from coast, spatial configuration of observed AGB pixels in Central Africa, computed with the terra package from elevation, and more. Therefore, it seems that the context does not provide enough information to answer the query regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
