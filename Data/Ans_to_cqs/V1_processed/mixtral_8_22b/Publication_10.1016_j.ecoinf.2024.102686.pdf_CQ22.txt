The given context does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help assess different aspects of the model's performance, such as its ability to correctly classify instances, minimize false positives or negatives, balance between precision and recall, and overall discriminating power.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors use the Clustering Quality Index (CQI) to evaluate the performance of their Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network. This metric helps determine the optimal number of categories for clustering ecological data. However, without further details about how CQI is computed or what criteria it considers, we cannot compare it directly to other commonly used evaluation metrics for deep learning models.
