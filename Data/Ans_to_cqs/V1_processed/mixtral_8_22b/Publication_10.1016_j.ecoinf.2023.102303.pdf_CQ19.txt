The deep learning model is implemented using the Keras API under the TensorFlow framework. This means that TensorFlow is the primary framework used to build the deep learning model. Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python, running on top of TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
