The given context does not provide any direct information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, based on common practices in research publications, authors often share their code repositories along with their published papers or articles. Therefore, it would be reasonable to check if the paper by Tisha Chawla, Shubh Mittal, and Hiteshwar Kumar Azad titled "MobileNet-GRU fusion for optimizing diagnosis of yellow vein mosaic virus" provides a link to the code repository. If no such link is found within the article itself, one could also search for the author names on popular code hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket to see if they have shared the relevant code there.
