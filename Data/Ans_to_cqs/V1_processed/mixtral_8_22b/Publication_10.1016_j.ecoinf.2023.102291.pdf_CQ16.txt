The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training. This suggests that the authors likely monitored both metrics throughout the training process and stopped training once they observed no further improvement or reached a predefined threshold. Additionally, the use of early stopping could have been employed to prevent overfitting and halt training if performance on the validation set began to degrade. Therefore, while the exact criteria are not specified, it can be inferred that validation accuracy, precision, and possibly early stopping were considered to decide when training should conclude.
