The text does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) were used. These methods often rely on labeled data for training, which may involve various annotation techniques like bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Nevertheless, the exact annotation technique employed in this study remains unspecified.
