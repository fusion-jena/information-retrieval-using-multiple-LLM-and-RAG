The text does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the parameters of the deep learning network are adjusted using annotated data through an optimization process. This suggests that some form of optimization technique was employed to adjust the parameters of the model. Common methods for optimizing hyperparameters include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Without further context, it cannot be determined which method was specifically used in this case.
