The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide information about common methods used to handle data imbalance and bias in machine learning models. These include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, then randomly selecting samples from each stratum to maintain the original distribution. This technique helps ensure that minority classes are adequately represented in the training set.

Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating existing instances or generating synthetic ones. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is a popular method for creating new samples based on interpolation between neighboring points.

Undersampling reduces the size of majority classes by removing instances until they match the size of minority classes. Random under-sampling removes random instances from the majority class, while informed under-sampling selectively eliminates redundant or noisy instances.

Collecting diverse data aims to improve model performance by incorporating various sources, demographics, and perspectives. This approach can help mitigate biases introduced by limited or homogeneous datasets.
