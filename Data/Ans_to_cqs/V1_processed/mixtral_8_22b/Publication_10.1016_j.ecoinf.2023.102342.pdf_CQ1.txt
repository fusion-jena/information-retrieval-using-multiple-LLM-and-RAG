Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be derived from the text. For instance, the operational workflow mentioned includes steps such as 'identification of the aim for a specific study area,' which suggests that the collection of raw data might have been guided by a particular research focus or goal. Additionally, the phrase 'analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface water bodies' implies that some form of sampling or measurement was conducted to gather this data. Furthermore, the reference to 'big spatiotemporal data' could suggest the use of sensor networks or other forms of automated data collection over time and across different locations. Nevertheless, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods were employed for gathering raw data in this context.
