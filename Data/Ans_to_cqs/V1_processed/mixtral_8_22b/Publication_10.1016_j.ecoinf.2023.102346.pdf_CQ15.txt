Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam being applied in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. However, it does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms like Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for habitat suitability prediction. These algorithms may have their own optimization techniques built-in, but without further details, I cannot provide more specific information regarding the optimization techniques used in this case.
