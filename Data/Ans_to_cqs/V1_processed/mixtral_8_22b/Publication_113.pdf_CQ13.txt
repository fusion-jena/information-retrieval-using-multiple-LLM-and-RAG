The context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that every deep learning algorithm has numerous hyperparameters, which are selected by the data scientist before machine learning begins. These hyperparameters include well-known values used to train their models. Common examples of hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer type, batch size, epoch count, and regularization parameters. Without more specific information, it cannot be determined exactly which hyperparameters were used in this case.
