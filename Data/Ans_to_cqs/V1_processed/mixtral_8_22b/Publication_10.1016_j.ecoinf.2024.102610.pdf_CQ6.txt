The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss some preprocessing steps related to a classical random forest method. Two feature elimination techniques were employed: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These methods help reduce overfitting by removing unnecessary features from the dataset. Additionally, the text mentions using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a termination condition for RFE, indicating that error minimization is considered during the preprocessing stage. While these steps are relevant to preparing datasets for machine learning models like random forests, they may not directly apply to deep learning models. Typically, deep learning models require additional preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning to ensure optimal performance.
