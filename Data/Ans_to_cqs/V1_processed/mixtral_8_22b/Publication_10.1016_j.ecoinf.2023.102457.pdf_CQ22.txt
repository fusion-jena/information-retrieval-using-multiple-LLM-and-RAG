The primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this context is classification accuracy. Classification accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions made by the total number of predictions made. For instance, BirdNET achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.2% Â± 0.85 SD at 0 meters. Similarly, other models like MFCCs, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0 were also evaluated based on their respective classification accuracies. Additionally, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) was used as another evaluation metric for assessing the performance of different feature types as a function of distance for affinity propagation clustering and HDBSCAN.
