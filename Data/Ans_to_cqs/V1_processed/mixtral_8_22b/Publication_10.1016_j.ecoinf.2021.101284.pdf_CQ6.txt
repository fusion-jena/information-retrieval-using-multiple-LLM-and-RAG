Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the input data into a specific range or distribution, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. Scaling refers to rescaling the input data to reduce the impact of large differences in magnitude among different features. Cleaning involves removing noise from the input data, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies. Standardization is also mentioned as a type of normalization that changes the scale of individual variables while preserving their distance relationships. This technique is useful for datasets with multiple features having different scales.
