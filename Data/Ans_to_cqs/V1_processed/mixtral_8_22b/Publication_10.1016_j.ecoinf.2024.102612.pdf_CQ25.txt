The purpose of the deep learning (DL) model in this context is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is primarily used for semantic segmentation based on the information given. The authors mention training a DL model and then using it to segment real multi-spectral (MS) point clouds to create a ground truth. They also discuss using the same DL model to perform inference on real MS point clouds, which suggests that the model is being used for some form of image analysis or processing. Furthermore, they reference a specific type of DL architecture called SoftGroup, which has been shown to be effective for semantic segmentation tasks. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the DL model is not directly specified, it appears to be used for semantic segmentation of MS point cloud data.
