Based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, we can infer from the context that Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), including Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSELM), do not require fine manipulation or extensive parameter tuning like some other learning algorithms. This suggests that these models might rely more on inherent properties of the model rather than external stopping conditions such as validation loss plateaus. Nonetheless, without further details about the specific implementation or methodology used, it would be speculative to provide a definitive answer regarding the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
