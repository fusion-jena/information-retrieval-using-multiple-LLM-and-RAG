In the given context, it is stated that the proposed models were based on the most typical type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs due to the characteristics of the data used in this study. However, the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. It can be inferred that the authors used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) because they mention using pixel-wise inputs, which is a characteristic of CNNs. Furthermore, the authors discuss the possibility of using other types of deep learning models such as one-dimensional CNN, recurrent neural networks (RNN), and graph convolutional networks, suggesting that the current model is different from those. Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors used a CNN in their pipeline.
