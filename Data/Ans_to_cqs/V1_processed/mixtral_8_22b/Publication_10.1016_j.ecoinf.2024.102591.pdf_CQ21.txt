The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for fire scar delineation or other implemented workflows. However, based on general machine learning practices, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., creating confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifier, generating saliency maps to understand which parts of the input data were most important for the model's predictions, and performing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the trained model. These steps can help evaluate the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.
