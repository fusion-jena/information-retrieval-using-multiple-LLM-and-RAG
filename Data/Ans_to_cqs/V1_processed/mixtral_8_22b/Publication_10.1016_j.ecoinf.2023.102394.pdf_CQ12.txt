In the given context, it is mentioned that the researchers used a deep learning algorithm called the multilayer perceptron (MLP) for SOCS modeling. The MLP is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. It uses activation functions to connect adjacent layers and extract features from the input data. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is the multilayer perceptron (MLP).
