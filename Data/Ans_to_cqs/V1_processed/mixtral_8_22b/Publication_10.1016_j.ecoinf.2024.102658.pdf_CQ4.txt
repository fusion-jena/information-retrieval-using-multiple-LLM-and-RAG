Based on the given context, there is no information about any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Instead, the text discusses the use of two feature sets named 'random-CV' and'spatial-CV', which have been selected using different cross-validation processes. These feature sets include various climate variables obtained from WorldClim and ETCCDI sources. Furthermore, the context mentions the application of forward feature selection (FFS) and evaluation of candidate logistic regression and random forest models using both random cross-validation (CV) and spatial CV methods. However, these procedures do not directly relate to data augmentation techniques typically employed in deep learning pipelines.
