Based on the provided context, there isn't any direct mention of addressing data bias specifically during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general insights into common techniques used to handle data bias in such scenarios. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified Splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target classes in both subsets. It helps ensure that the model learns from a representative sample of all classes, thus mitigating potential biases caused by imbalanced datasets.

Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has significantly fewer samples compared to others. By duplicating examples from the minority class, this approach aims to balance the dataset and reduce bias towards the majority class. A popular oversampling technique is Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates new synthetic samples instead of simply duplicating existing ones.

Undersampling: Undersampling is another strategy employed to tackle imbalanced datasets. Unlike oversampling, undersampling focuses on removing examples from the majority class until it reaches a balanced state with the minority class. Random Under Sampling (RUS) is a simple yet effective undersampling method that randomly removes samples from the majority class.

Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse data is crucial to minimize biases introduced due to limited representation in the dataset. Ensuring that the collected data covers different demographics, geographical locations, or other relevant factors can help create a more robust and unbiased model.
