The text does not provide information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions an iterative process where the design is adjusted based on assessment results, which suggests that monitoring might involve evaluating the design against certain criteria or metrics. This evaluation could be done after each iteration, allowing designers to identify areas needing improvement and refine the design accordingly. The goal is to achieve a high-performance design or meet desired objectives.
