The given context does not provide information about which specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions several machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Adaboost, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), LightGBM, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) being employed in the study. These algorithms can be implemented using various programming languages and libraries, including Python with Scikit-learn, but no explicit mention of any deep learning framework is made in the provided context.
