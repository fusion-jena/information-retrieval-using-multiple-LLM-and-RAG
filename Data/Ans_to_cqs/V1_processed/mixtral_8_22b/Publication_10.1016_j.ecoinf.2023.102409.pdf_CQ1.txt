The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that mean groundwater data was derived from a machine learning model constructed based on groundwater monitoring data collected from 74 wells in the lower Tarim River Basin. Additionally, high-resolution (0.8m) remote sensing images were used to investigate the performance of different deep learning models. Therefore, it can be inferred that the collection of raw data may involve various methods such as sensor-based monitoring systems (for example, water level sensors or satellite imagery) and publicly available datasets (like those from ESRI and ESA). Nonetheless, without further context, it is impossible to determine the exact methods employed for gathering raw data in this particular scenario.
