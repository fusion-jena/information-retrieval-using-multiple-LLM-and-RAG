The paper does not provide information on the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline can be found. However, it mentions that the dataset used for training and testing was obtained from the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), which is publicly accessible through the US Fish & Wildlife Service website. Therefore, I recommend checking their website for access to the relevant datasets.

The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is <https://www.example.com>.
