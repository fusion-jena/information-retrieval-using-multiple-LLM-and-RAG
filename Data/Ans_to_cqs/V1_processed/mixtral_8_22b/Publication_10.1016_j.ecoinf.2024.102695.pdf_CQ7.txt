The data was divided chronologically into three sets: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. This allocation strategy aims to better simulate real-world scenarios, where the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data. By doing so, it ensures that the model has enhanced generalizability.
