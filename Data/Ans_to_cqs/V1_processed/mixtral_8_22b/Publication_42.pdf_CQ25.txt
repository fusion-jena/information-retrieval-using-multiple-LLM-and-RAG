The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is for the classification of moth species. The authors aimed to design a customized network that would be light and fast enough to execute on an embedded Raspberry Pi computer used in a light trap. They investigated several CNN architectures and explored hyperparameters to find the optimal network architecture for this specific task. The final architecture chosen achieved an average precision, recall, and F1-score of 93%, indicating a suitable model classification.
