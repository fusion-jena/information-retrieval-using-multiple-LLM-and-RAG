The provided context does not directly discuss specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it provides metadata fields related to various aspects of image acquisition, processing, and curation for satellite and aerial images using deep learning. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are techniques employed during model training to reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. On the other hand, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the sum of squared weights, encouraging smaller weight values and reducing overfitting. These regularization methods can be applied when developing deep learning models for analyzing satellite and aerial images but are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
