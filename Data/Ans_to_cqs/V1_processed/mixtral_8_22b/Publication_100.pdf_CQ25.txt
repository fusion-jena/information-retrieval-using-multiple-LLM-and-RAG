The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, considering the description of the model architecture and the mention of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are often used for tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, or object detection, it can be inferred that the model might be designed for similar purposes. Specifically, the model uses a combination of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, suggesting its application could involve multi-modal analysis or fusion. Furthermore, the focus on forested areas indicates that the model may be intended for tasks related to land cover classification, change detection, or biomass estimation. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, this remains speculative.
