The text does not provide explicit information about the purpose of a specific deep learning model. However, it discusses the integration of models into a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) framework, suggesting that the primary goal might involve either classifying or predicting continuous variables. Additionally, the text mentions the use of Random Forests (RBF-GFR-RF) and their superior performance compared to other models, further indicating a focus on classification tasks. Nonetheless, without more precise details regarding the nature of the data and the intended application, it remains challenging to pinpoint the exact purpose of any potential deep learning model within this context.
