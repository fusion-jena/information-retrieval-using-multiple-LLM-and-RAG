After the Deep Learning (DL) model has been trained, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project or study. However, based on the given context, the following postprocessing steps were carried out:

1. Segmenting real Multispectral (MS) point clouds: After the model was trained, some samples of real MS point clouds were segmented using the methodology described in Section 2.3. This process created a ground truth dataset that could be used to validate the classifications made by the DL model when applied to synthetic data.

2. Testing the pretrained model: Once the ground truth dataset had been established, the pretrained model was then tested by applying it to the real MS point clouds. The results of these tests were presented in Figure 9.

3. Inputting the test results into a decision tree scheme: The outputs generated by testing the pretrained model on the real MS point clouds were then fed into a decision tree scheme. This scheme took into account factors such as vegetation structure and species response to fire in order to determine the appropriate fuel model for each classified MS point cloud.

4. Retrieving the final fuel model classifications: Based on the output of the decision tree scheme, the final fuel model classifications were determined and summarized in Table 3.

It should be noted that while these postprocessing steps were specifically tailored towards determining fuel models for use in wildland fire management, other projects may require different types of postprocessing analysis. For example, saliency maps, metrics calculations, confusion matrices, and other techniques might be employed to evaluate the performance of the DL model or gain further insights into its predictions.
