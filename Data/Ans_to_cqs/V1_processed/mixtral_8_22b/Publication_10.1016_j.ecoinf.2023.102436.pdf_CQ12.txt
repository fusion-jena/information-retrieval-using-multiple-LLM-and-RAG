A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. This method allows planners and designers to compare changes between repeat photographs and identify general trends of landscape change. However, it should be noted that while image-based methods such as this one are powerful tools for assessing and tracking landscape visual quality, they may not fully capture or represent certain spatial attributes, such as volumes, which are important components within landscape composition. Additionally, the use of widely used visualization tools like Rhino, Sketchup, and 3D Max may transform or lose the aesthetic and scientific meaning of design projects during the modification and application process.
