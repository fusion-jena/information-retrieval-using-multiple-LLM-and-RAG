The given context does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the model allows the physical repository to be adapted to accommodate various laboratory storage systems. Therefore, I cannot determine whether AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform was used to deploy the deep learning model based on the provided context.
