Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, common methods for deploying machine learning models include model serialization, which involves saving the model in a format that can be loaded later, and platform selection, where the model is deployed on a suitable platform such as cloud services or edge devices. Other considerations may also need to be taken into account depending on the specific use case and requirements.
