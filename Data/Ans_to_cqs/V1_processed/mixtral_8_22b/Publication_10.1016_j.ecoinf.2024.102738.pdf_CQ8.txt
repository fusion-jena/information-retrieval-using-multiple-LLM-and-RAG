Unfortunately, there is no information provided about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The given context only includes details about datasets, spectral indices, land use and land cover (LULC) classes, and the location of the study area. It does not mention any specific code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is located.
