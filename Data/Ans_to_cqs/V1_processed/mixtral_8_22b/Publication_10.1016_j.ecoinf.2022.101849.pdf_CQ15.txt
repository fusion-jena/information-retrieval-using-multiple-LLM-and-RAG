In the provided piece of context, one optimization technique is mentioned in relation to the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the feed-forward neural network is trained with the Adam optimizer. This choice of optimizer is likely due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training, which can lead to faster convergence and improved performance compared to other optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Additionally, the use of the mean absolute error loss function suggests that the goal of the model is to minimize the average magnitude of the prediction errors, rather than focusing solely on minimizing the overall error rate. Overall, these choices reflect a thoughtful approach to designing and implementing a deep learning pipeline for the given task.
