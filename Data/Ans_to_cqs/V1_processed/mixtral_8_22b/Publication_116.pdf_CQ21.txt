Based on the provided information, it appears that the focus is primarily on describing the architecture and parameters of a deep learning model, along with details about the experimental setup involving biased and unbiased datasets. Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps performed after model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices. Therefore, without additional context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the postprocessing steps involved after model training.
