The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of historical imagery and segmentation techniques combined with machine learning for image classification. It also discusses the potential benefits of developing new methods for improving image classifications. Therefore, we can infer that one method for collecting raw data might involve obtaining historical imagery, possibly through satellite or aerial photography. Additionally, the table provides site characteristics such as distance from the coast, average elevation, latitude, longitude, total annual rainfall, and July-August mean temperature, suggesting that environmental data collection methods like weather stations or GPS measurements could also play a role in gathering relevant data.
