To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which likely included various types of data related to different species. This is suggested by the mention of'species-specific models', indicating that multiple datasets were used for training individual models for specific species. Secondly, environmental cross-validation with ten folds was employed to accurately represent the predictive error in new environments. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a statistical model will generalize to an independent dataset, thus ensuring its robustness and reliability. Lastly, although not explicitly mentioned, it can be assumed that stratified splitting might have been applied during the creation of the training and validation sets. Stratification ensures that both sets maintain similar distributions of target classes, preventing any class imbalance issues that could negatively impact the model's performance.
