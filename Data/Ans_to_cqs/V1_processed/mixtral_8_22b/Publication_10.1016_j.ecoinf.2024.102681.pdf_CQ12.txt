The study uses a hybrid deep learning model called CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory), which combines both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models. The CNN component is responsible for extracting spatial features from input data, while the LSTM component handles sequential or temporal information. This combination allows the model to effectively process complex relationships between different variables and improve its predictive capabilities.
