The given context does not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in deep learning applications, various methods can be employed for gathering raw data. These include but are not limited to:

1. Surveys: Data collection through surveys involves gathering information from individuals via questionnaires or interviews. This method is often used when human insights are required for specific tasks such as sentiment analysis or emotion recognition.

2. Sensors: Sensor data collection involves utilizing devices equipped with sensors like cameras, microphones, GPS, accelerometers, etc., to gather real-world data. For instance, in environmental studies, sensor data might be collected from weather stations, water quality monitors, or air pollution detectors.

3. Public Datasets: Utilizing publicly available datasets is another common practice in deep learning research. These datasets could have been gathered from various sources, including online platforms, government databases, or scientific research projects. Examples of popular public datasets include ImageNet for computer vision tasks, MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, and COCO for object detection and segmentation.

Based on the context provided, it appears that the study focuses on applying the DeepLabV3+ algorithm for semantic segmentation tasks related to land cover/land use (LCLU) classification. While the exact source of the dataset isn't mentioned, one can infer that the researchers likely used satellite or aerial imagery data due to their relevance to the task at hand. Nonetheless, without more specific information regarding the data collection process, it remains uncertain whether the data were obtained through direct acquisition, public datasets, or other means.
