The given context does not provide information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions the use of spatial inputs, specifically a dataset of dimensions 257 x 257 x 9, referred to as masks of states. This suggests that some form of image-based data was utilized in the study. Unfortunately, without further details regarding the nature of the data and its processing, it is impossible to determine the exact data annotation techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline.
