Two datasets were mentioned in the given context:

1. COCO 2017train dataset - This dataset was used to pretrain the Mask R-CNN model. The Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset containing images from various categories such as people, vehicles, animals, etc.

2. Kinetics-400 dataset - This dataset was used to pretrain the ResNet models. The Kinetics-400 dataset consists of around 300K videos belonging to 400 human action classes. Each clip lasts approximately 10 seconds and is labeled with one or multiple actions occurring in the scene.

These two datasets serve different purposes within the deep learning pipeline. While the COCO dataset focuses on static image analysis tasks such as object detection and segmentation, the Kinetics-400 dataset targets dynamic video understanding tasks like action recognition.
