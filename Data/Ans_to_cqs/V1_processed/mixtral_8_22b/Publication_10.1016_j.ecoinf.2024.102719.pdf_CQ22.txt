The paper by Zamri et al. does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions bias-variance decomposition as a technique for evaluating the generalizability of machine learning models. This suggests that the authors may have considered metrics such as mean squared error or root mean squared error, which are commonly used in regression tasks to measure bias and variance. Additionally, since the paper discusses the use of deep learning and other machine learning models for river health prediction, classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score could also potentially be relevant. Nevertheless, without further information, it is impossible to determine precisely which metrics were employed in this particular study.
