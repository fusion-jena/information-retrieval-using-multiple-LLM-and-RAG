Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of which specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether GPUs or TPUs were utilized during the training process. However, considering that deep learning models often require substantial computational power, it would not be unreasonable to assume that either GPUs or TPUs might have been employed for efficient processing.
