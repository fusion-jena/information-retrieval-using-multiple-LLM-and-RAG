The text does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation. However, it suggests that large datasets of fish images are required for training deep learning models to provide accurate biomass estimates. It also mentions the potential benefits of incorporating Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings to improve the detection and classification of fish species within the dataset. Additionally, modifying the architecture of deep learning models like YOLO may help handle different environmental factors affecting fish biomass. Therefore, while no specific datasets are mentioned, it is clear that large datasets of fish images would be necessary for this application.
