The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that some models like TernausNet use pre-trained networks such as VGG11 trained on ImageNet for image segmentation tasks. Additionally, the paper by Minaee et al. (2022) discusses various deep learning techniques for image segmentation but does not mention any specific dataset names. Therefore, without additional context or references, it is not possible to determine the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
