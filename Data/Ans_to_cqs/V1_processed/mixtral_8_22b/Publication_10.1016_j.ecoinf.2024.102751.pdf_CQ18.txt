The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using the 'yardstick' package for R, specifically the'metrics' function. Three selected model parameters are calculated to assess the accuracy of the developed model: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2. These metrics help evaluate the model's performance and its ability to accurately predict Volumetric Water Content (VWC). Additionally, the method used to estimate the model parameters includes automatic elimination of variables with little impact on the modeled explanatory variable, which can be seen through the'select = T' parameter. Furthermore, due to the skewed distribution of the modeled variable VWC, a gamma distribution with a natural logarithm as the linking function is employed for modeling.
