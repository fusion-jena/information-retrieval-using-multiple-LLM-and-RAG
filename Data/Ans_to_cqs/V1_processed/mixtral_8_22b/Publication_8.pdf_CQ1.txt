In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge about deep learning, some possible sources of raw data could include:

1. Surveys: In certain cases, data may be collected through surveys or questionnaires, which can then be processed and fed into a deep learning model. For example, in natural language processing tasks, text data might be gathered via online forms or social media platforms.

2. Sensors: Various types of sensors can collect data for deep learning applications. This includes cameras for image recognition tasks, microphones for speech recognition, or even specialized sensors like LiDAR for autonomous driving systems.

3. Public Datasets: Many researchers rely on publicly available datasets when working with deep learning models. These datasets often contain large volumes of labeled examples, making them ideal for training and testing purposes. Examples include ImageNet for object recognition, MS COCO for object detection, and the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) for natural language understanding.

Without further context, it is not possible to determine which method(s) were employed in this particular study. Nonetheless, these three approaches represent common ways of gathering raw data for deep learning pipelines.
