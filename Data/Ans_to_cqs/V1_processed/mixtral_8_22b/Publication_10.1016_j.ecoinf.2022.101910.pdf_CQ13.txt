The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that there are mainly three settings that can be adjusted in BirdNET: the detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and the minimum confidence threshold. These were set to 1.5, 1.5 seconds, and 0.4, respectively.
