The provided context does not mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets contain images of handwritten digits, small natural images, and large-scale natural images, respectively. Without further context, I cannot provide a definitive list of datasets used in the described deep learning pipeline.

The provided context discusses modifications made to a model, including updating the criterion to maintain stochasticity while allowing for differentiation, optimizing the scope of the model, and implementing variance-reduction strategies. Additionally, the text mentions the limitations of the model as a classification model due to the demands of extensive computational resources when using the Monte Carlo method. However, no specific datasets are mentioned in relation to these modifications or limitations.
