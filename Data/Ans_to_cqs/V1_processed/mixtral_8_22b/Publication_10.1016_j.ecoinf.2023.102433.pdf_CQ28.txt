According to the provided context, it appears that the deep learning model was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform managed by Google. Therefore, it can be inferred that the platform used to deploy the deep learning model is Google Cloud Platform. However, it should be noted that while GEE is built on top of Google Cloud Platform, it does not provide direct access to the underlying infrastructure like traditional cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure. Instead, GEE provides a high-level abstraction layer that enables users to perform large-scale geospatial analyses without having to manage the underlying infrastructure themselves. In summary, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the deep learning model was deployed on Google Cloud Platform via the use of Google Earth Engine.
