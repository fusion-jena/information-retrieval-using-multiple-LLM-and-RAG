The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves embedding the testing data into the constructed UMAP model for projection in the latent space. The authors compute the nearest neighbor Euclidean distance between species-species (Dss) and background-species (Dsb) for both training and test data. They calculate Pss, the cumulative empirical distribution function of the intra-species distance Dss, using a specific formula. After determining the Pss function, they calculate S = (1 - Pss) for the distances between the background and species. To assess UMAP as a binary classifier, the authors use the maximum information coefficient (MIC) to measure the amount of information shared by each pair of variables. Additionally, they estimate several indices such as the area under the curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), kappa index K, and the point-biserial correlation (COR) index. These metrics help evaluate the performance of the UMAP model during training.
