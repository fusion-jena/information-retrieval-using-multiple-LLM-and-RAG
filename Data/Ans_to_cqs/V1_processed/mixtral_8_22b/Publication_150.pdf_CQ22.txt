The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and macro precision. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision refers to the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly. Macro precision is the unweighted mean of precisions across all classes.

In the given context, four different models - Wide-ResNet101, InceptionV3, ResNet101, and MnasNet-A1 - have been compared based on their performance and speed. The comparison includes various metrics like model size, speed, top-1 accuracy, top-2 accuracy, top-3 accuracy, top-4 accuracy, top-5 accuracy, macro recall, and macro precision. Among these models, InceptionV3 offers a good balance between performance and speed, having the highest precision and closely matching Wide-ResNet's accuracy and recall while being significantly faster.
