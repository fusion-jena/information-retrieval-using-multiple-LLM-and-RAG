The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that the initial version of the BA algorithm implemented in FIREMAP involves a supervised machine learning classification to procure a BA vector of the region of interest defined by the user. This process uses a large predefined training dataset consisting of atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2 A scenes. These scenes are likely in a raster format, considering they are satellite images. Additionally, the results can be exported to the user's Google Drive account in the preferred raster format for the region of interest. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is raster data, specifically satellite imagery.
