The information provided does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, and validation. However, common practices in machine learning include splitting the dataset randomly, stratified sampling based on class labels, or using a time-based split if the data has a temporal component. The specific criteria would depend on the goals of the project and the nature of the data collected.
