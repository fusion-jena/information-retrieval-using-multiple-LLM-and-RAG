The text does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for deep learning model training. However, it mentions that both Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were trained using 5-fold cross-validation. This means that the original dataset was divided into five equal or nearly equal parts, called folds. Four out of five folds were used for training the models, while the remaining fold was used for validation. This process was repeated five times, ensuring that each fold served once as the validation set. After this, the entire dataset was likely used for training the final model before evaluating its performance on unseen test data.
