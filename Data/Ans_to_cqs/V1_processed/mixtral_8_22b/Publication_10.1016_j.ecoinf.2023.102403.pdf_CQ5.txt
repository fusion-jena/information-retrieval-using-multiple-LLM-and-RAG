Based on the given context, it appears that the study does not involve any image datasets typically used in deep learning pipelines like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the research focuses on analyzing marine biodiversity data obtained from various sources, including FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS. These platforms provide extensive information about marine life, such as taxonomy, ecological characteristics, and historical occurrence records. The authors have filtered their dataset based on specific criteria, retaining only relevant columns such as scientific names, family, year, longitude, and latitude. They have also eliminated duplicates and missing values to ensure high-quality data. Therefore, the datasets used in this study primarily consist of marine biodiversity data rather than traditional computer vision datasets.
