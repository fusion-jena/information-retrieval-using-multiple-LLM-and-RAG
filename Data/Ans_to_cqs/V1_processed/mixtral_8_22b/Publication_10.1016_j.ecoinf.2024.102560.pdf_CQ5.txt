The text does not provide information on the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions several datasets used for different purposes within the research.

For instance, the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) dataset was used to analyze precipitation data and estimate satellite-based precipitation. This dataset has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees and a temporal resolution of monthly. Additionally, Landsat satellite datasets were employed to examine water surface area and salinity variations over a long period (1985 - 2020).

Furthermore, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets were utilized for drought monitoring. These datasets include the 16-day composite MODIS vegetation product (MOD13Q1) at a 250-meter spatial resolution and the eight-day composite MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) product (MOD11A2) at a one-kilometer spatial resolution.

However, these datasets are not typically associated with deep learning pipelines like those mentioned in the query. Instead, they are commonly used in geospatial analysis, climate studies, and environmental research.
