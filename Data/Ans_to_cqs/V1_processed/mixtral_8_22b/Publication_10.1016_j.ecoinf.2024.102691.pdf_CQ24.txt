To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to use a fixed random seed value across different runs of the same experiment. By setting a specific seed value, we ensure that the results obtained are reproducible and consistent. Another strategy is to perform multiple runs with different random seeds and then average the results. This helps reduce the impact of any single run being influenced by a particularly favorable or unfavorable initialization. Additionally, techniques such as dropout and data augmentation can also help mitigate the effects of randomness by introducing controlled variability into the training process. Dropout randomly drops out neurons during training, which helps prevent overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust features. Data augmentation involves applying random transformations to the input data, such as rotations, translations, and flips, which increases the diversity of the training data and makes the model more resilient to variations in the input.
