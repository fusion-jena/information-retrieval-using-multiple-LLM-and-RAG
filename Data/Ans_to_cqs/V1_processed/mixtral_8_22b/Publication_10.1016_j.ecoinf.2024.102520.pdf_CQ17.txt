Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training dataset too well, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are Dropout and L2 Regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. By ignoring some neurons, the network becomes more robust and can better generalize to new data. Dropout rates typically range from 0.2 to 0.5, depending on the complexity of the problem and the size of the network.

L2 Regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the cost function proportional to the sum of squared weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model simpler and reducing the risk of overfitting. The strength of the regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter called lambda, which determines how much emphasis is placed on minimizing the penalty term compared to minimizing the error term.

Other regularization methods include L1 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Data Augmentation. L1 Regularization works similarly to L2 Regularization but penalizes the absolute value of the weights instead of their square. Early Stopping stops training once validation performance starts to degrade, while Data Augmentation generates additional training examples by applying transformations to existing data.

In summary, regularization methods like Dropout and L2 Regularization help prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by adding constraints to the optimization process. These methods encourage simpler models that generalize better to new data, improving overall performance.
