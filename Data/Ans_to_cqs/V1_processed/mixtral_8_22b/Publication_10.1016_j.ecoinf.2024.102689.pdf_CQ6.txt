The context does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that image processing is one of the preprocessing steps since images are mentioned to be processed at a resolution of 1024 x 1024. Other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning might also be applied but are not explicitly stated in the given context.

Based on general practices in machine learning, data preprocessing often involves tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and splitting datasets into training and testing sets. For image data specifically, additional preprocessing techniques may include resizing images, converting color spaces, applying filters, or augmenting images to increase the diversity of the dataset. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model during training.
