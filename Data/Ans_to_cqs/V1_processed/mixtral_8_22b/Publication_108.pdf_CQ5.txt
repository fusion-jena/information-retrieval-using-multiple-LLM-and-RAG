In this study, the authors did not use any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, they created their own custom dataset using orthophotos. They divided each orthophoto of size 10,000 x 10,000 pixels into 1525 tiles of 256 x 256 pixels. This resulted in a large number of small image cubes that could be fed into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The data (orthophoto and corresponding labels) were then split into three datasets: training (80%), validation (20%), and test (two full images of 10,000 x 10,000 pixels). The training data were used for optimizing the neural network, while the validation dataset was used to assess the performance during the training process. The test dataset was used to assess the performance of the final optimized neural network.
