The performance of the deep learning model in this study is evaluated using four specific metrics: the coefficient of determination (R2), mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics help assess different aspects of the model's performance. The R2 metric measures the proportion of the dependent variable variation explained by the independent variables in the model. The MBE helps identify any systematic bias in the model's predictions, while the RMSE and MAE provide insights into the magnitude of the prediction errors. Higher R2 scores, lower RMSE and MAE scores, and MBE figures close to zero indicate better model performance.
