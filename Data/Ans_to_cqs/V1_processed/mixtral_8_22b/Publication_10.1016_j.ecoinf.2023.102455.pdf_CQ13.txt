In this study, several deep learning models were employed for forecasting streamflow in Bear and Winter Rivers of PEI. For instance, one of these models was a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), referred to as CNN-BiGRU. The table representing the optimal hyperparameters for this model includes various components such as CNN layers, BiGRU layers, kernel size, optimizer, activation function, number of filters, epochs, batch size, learning rate, and dense units.

For the CNN-BiGRU model, the specific hyperparameters include:

* CNN Layers: 2
* Filters: 64
* Kernel Size: [1,4]
* BiGRU Layers: 1
* BiGRU Neurons: 30
* Optimizer: Adam
* Activation Function:'relu'
* Epochs: 43 or 1000 depending on the application
* Batch Size: 32
* Learning Rate: 0.000455 or 0.0015 depending on the application
* Dense Units: 100

These hyperparameters play crucial roles in determining the performance of the deep learning model. For example, the learning rate controls how much the weights should be updated during each iteration, while the optimizer determines the method used to update the weights. Additionally, the choice of activation function can impact the nonlinearity introduced into the model, affecting its overall complexity and ability to learn patterns within the data.
