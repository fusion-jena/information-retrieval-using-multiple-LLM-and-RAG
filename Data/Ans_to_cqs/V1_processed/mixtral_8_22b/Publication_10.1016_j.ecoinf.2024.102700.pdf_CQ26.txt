The given context does not provide direct information about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some common techniques used to handle data imbalance or bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a technique where the dataset is divided into strata or subgroups, and then samples are drawn from each stratum in such a way that they represent the population accurately. This helps maintain the balance of different classes in the dataset.

Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class by replicating them or creating synthetic examples using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Undersampling, on the other hand, reduces the size of the majority class by randomly removing instances or selecting only those that contribute most to the model's performance.

Diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data by including various sources, demographics, or features. This can help reduce bias introduced due to underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain groups in the dataset.
