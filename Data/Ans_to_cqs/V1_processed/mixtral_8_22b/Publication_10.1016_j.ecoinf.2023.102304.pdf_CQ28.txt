The text does not provide information about which specific platform was used to deploy a deep learning model. However, it mentions that the data preparation and LTR implementation were run in the Google Earth Engine platform. This suggests that the authors may have used this platform for their work, but it doesn't explicitly state that they deployed a deep learning model there. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
