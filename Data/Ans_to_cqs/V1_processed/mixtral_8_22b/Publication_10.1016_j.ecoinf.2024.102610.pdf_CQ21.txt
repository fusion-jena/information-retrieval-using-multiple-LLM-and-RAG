The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps taken after model training. However, it is mentioned that spatial cross-validation was employed to prevent potential performance degradation and overfitting. Additionally, two common variable elimination techniques for random forests were utilized: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). These methods help refine the models by removing unnecessary or redundant features. After these processes, the resulting databases were named according to their respective feature selection method and year range. It is also noted that all analyses were conducted using R programming with the Caret and VSURF packages. Therefore, based on the given information, it cannot be determined what specific postprocessing steps were carried out beyond those already described.
