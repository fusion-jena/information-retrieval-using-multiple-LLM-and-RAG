The text does not explicitly mention specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it refers to several datasets relevant to the study. One key dataset mentioned is the 'WorldClim' dataset, which provides bioclimatic data used as input for the CNN model. Additionally, the study uses a dataset of plant photographs from the iNaturalist platform. Although these datasets may not be as widely recognized as those commonly used in computer vision tasks like MNIST or ImageNet, they play a crucial role in this particular research project focused on plant functional traits prediction.
