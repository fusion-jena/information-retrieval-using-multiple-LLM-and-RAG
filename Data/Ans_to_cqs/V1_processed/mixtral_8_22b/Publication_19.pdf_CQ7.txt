A 60-20-20 train/validate/test regime was used to randomly split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. This means that 60% of the data was used for training, while 20% was used for validation and another 20% for testing. The specific numbers of images for each set can be found in TABLE I under the headings 'Training', 'Validation', and 'Testing'.
