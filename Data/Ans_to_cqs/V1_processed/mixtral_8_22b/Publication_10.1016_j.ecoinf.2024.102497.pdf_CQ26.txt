In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of target variables in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of the entire dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance datasets when dealing with imbalanced classes. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling decreases the number of instances in the majority class. Both methods aim to create a more balanced dataset for better model performance.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and demographics to ensure that the dataset represents different perspectives and experiences. This can help reduce biases introduced by relying solely on one source or group of people.

While these techniques aren't explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they could be considered when working with deep learning pipelines to mitigate potential data biases.
