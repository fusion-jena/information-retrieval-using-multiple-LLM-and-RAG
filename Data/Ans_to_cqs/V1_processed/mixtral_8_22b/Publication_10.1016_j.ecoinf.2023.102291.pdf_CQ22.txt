The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity or recall, specificity, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of all correct predictions made by the model. Precision is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. It indicates how many of the predicted positive cases are actually positive. Sensitivity or recall measures the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity calculates the proportion of actual negative cases that are correctly identified as negatives. Lastly, the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both factors. In this study, the ResNet152V2 model achieved 83.9% accuracy with Precision=56.1%, Sensitivity=37.2%, and Specificity=93.8%. Increasing the dpi in the training images improved the model's precision but decreased its sensitivity, resulting in lower accuracy. The best CNN1 model showed lower precision than the one built using 90 dpi but had higher sensitivity, thus reflecting a higher F1 score.
