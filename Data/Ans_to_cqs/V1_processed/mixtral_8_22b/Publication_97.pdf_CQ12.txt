In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the U-Net architecture is employed for the task of forest damage segmentation. This is evident from the description of the implementation process, where it is mentioned that the authors use a Python-based computational environment built on top of the Keras framework with Tensorflow as its backend to implement their proposed U-Net-like CNN. Furthermore, they perform a grid search over various configurations of the U-Net-like architectures to find the most suitable one for their specific application.
