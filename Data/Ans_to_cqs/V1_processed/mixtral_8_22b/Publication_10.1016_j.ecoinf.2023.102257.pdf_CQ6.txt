The text does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as MegaDetector. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling numeric variables so they fall within a specified range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling adjusts the values of numeric features to bring them to similar scales, reducing the risk of certain features dominating others during model training. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, outliers, and other anomalies that may affect model performance. While these preprocessing steps are generally applicable, it is important to note that the exact preprocessing techniques employed will depend on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the specific deep learning task.
