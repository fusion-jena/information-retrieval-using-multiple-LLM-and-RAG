The given context does not provide information on specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on describing the process of calculating attention in a transformer model using formulas and equations. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine what data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
