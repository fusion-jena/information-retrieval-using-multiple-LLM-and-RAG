The given context does not provide information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of a Random Forest (RF) model with specific parameters such as the number of trees (n_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max\_features). These parameters were tuned using a grid search method (GridSearchCV) based on the out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation to find the optimal values. However, no details regarding the hyperparameters of a deep learning model are mentioned in the provided context.
