The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, considering the domain of application mentioned -'vegetation responses to extreme drought', one can infer that the model might be used for prediction or forecasting tasks. This is further supported by the mention of 'predictive models for vegetation health and land surface dynamics forecasting'. Additionally, the reference to architectures like ConvLSTM and models like Channel-U-Net and Arcon, which are often used for sequence prediction tasks, also suggests that the deep learning model could be employed for time series prediction or forecasting.
