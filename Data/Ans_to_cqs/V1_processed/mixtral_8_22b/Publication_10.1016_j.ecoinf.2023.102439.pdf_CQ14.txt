The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it is mentioned that after comparing Mean Square Error (MSE) and R values for different numbers of neurons in the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) system, the best model was determined to have six hidden layer neurons. This suggests that some form of parameter tuning or optimization process might have been used, but the specific methods like grid search or random search are not explicitly stated. Therefore, we cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized based solely on the given context.
