After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the model's performance and understand its behavior. Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have conducted rigorous folded cross-validation by partitioning their dataset into ten equal sections or folds. This methodology involves a cyclical process of training and testing, where each fold serves as the test set while the remaining folds are used for training. Once the model has been trained, it is evaluated on the test set, and the resulting performance metrics are recorded.

In this case, the authors mention that they obtained comprehensive assessments of the model's performance by averaging the outcomes from each fold. They also compare their proposed model to a benchmark model using key metrics such as recognition accuracy and recall. To further illustrate the disparities between the two models, the authors provide quantitative values and data visualizations. Additionally, they maintain control over external factors that could potentially influence the results, ensuring the precision and reliability of their tests.

Based on this information, some possible postprocessing steps that the authors may have taken include calculating various evaluation metrics, creating confusion matrices, generating saliency maps, and conducting statistical analyses. However, without more specific details about the exact methods used, it is difficult to determine which postprocessing steps were taken with certainty.
