In this investigation, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). OLS belongs to the set of LSE optimizers and is used to minimize the sum of squared residuals. In this method, the difference between the measured data and the estimated vector of weights is calculated. Then, a cost function is determined for this vector, which is minimized to find the optimal weights. The derivative of the cost function with respect to the weight vector is then calculated and set equal to zero to determine the coefficients satisfying the equation. This method is described briefly in the given context, but more details can be found in Uyank and Guler (2013). Other optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) are not mentioned in the provided context.
