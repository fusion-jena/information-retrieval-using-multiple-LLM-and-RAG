The deep learning model was trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2017) with the default hyperparameters. A cosine decay scheduler was employed for the learning rate. The loss function utilized was cross-entropy for multi-class single-label classification. The macro-averaged f1-score on the validation set assisted in monitoring the model convergence.
