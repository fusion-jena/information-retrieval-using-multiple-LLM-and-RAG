The performance of the deep learning models in this study is primarily evaluated using two quantitative measures: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These metrics are commonly used for evaluating generative models, which can be challenging due to the existence of multiple possible solutions.

For instance, the PConv networks are evaluated using these metrics after being trained for 50 epochs. Each training epoch involves saving the model as the best one based on its performance on the validation set, measured by validation loss. Similarly, the Pix2Pix networks are also assessed using PSNR and SSIM metrics after being trained for 50 epochs. However, their performance is checked every 500 iterations, and the model is saved as the best one if it improves upon the previous iterations' performance on the validation set.

On the other hand, classification networks use different metrics for performance evaluation. Given that our dataset is balanced, both networks are trained with a learning rate of 0.03 and cross-entropy loss as the loss function, optimized by the Adam optimizer. Although not explicitly mentioned, common metrics for evaluating classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
