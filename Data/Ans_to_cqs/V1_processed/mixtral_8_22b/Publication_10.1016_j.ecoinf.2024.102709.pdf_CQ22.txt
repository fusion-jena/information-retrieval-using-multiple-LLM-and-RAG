The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two main metrics: YOLO training losses and mean Average Precision (mAP50) values.

YOLO training losses measure the difference between the predicted and actual bounding boxes for each object in the image. Lower training losses indicate better performance of the model in accurately detecting the location of objects within the image.

Meanwhile, mAP50 values represent the average precision calculated over all classes when the Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold is set to 50%. Higher mAP50 values indicate a higher number of correctly predicted labels for the model trained on a specific split.

Additionally, classification loss (cls loss) is also used to measure the error in the predicted class probabilities for each object in the image compared with the ground truth. Lower cls loss values suggest that the model is more accurate in predicting the class of the objects. This value is computed using a cross-entropy loss function.
