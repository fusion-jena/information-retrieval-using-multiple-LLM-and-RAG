Based on the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be derived from the references mentioned. For instance, reference 31 discusses accelerating image-based ecological surveys with interactive machine learning, suggesting that image data might be collected through ecological surveys. Additionally, references 32 and 33 focus on benefits of hyperspectral remote sensing for tracking plant invasions and early detection of invasive weeds, respectively. These sources imply that remote sensing techniques could also be employed for gathering raw data. Lastly, the use of MobileNetV2 and ResNet50V2 models suggests that image data is involved, possibly obtained from publicly available datasets or custom collections. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it remains unclear what exact methods are utilized for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline.
