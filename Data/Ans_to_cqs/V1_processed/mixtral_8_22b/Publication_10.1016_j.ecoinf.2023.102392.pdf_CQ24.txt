Unfortunately, there is no information available in the given context about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some common strategies used to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or bagging to reduce variance caused by random sampling, and using ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained on different subsets of data.
