Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, generally speaking, common criteria used to determine when training is complete include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting some predefined stopping condition such as early stopping based on no improvement in validation error over a specified number of epochs. In this case, since the Random Forest (RF) model was used, the training process may have been stopped once the out-of-bag error rate stabilizes or reaches a satisfactory level. Additionally, cross-validation can be employed to evaluate the generalization performance of the trained model and help decide when to stop training.
