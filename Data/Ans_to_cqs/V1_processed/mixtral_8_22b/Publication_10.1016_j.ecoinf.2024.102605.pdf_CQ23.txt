Based on the given context, there is no specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of any particular deep learning model. However, some common methods used to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, regularization techniques, and transfer learning. These methods help prevent overfitting and improve the ability of the model to perform well on unseen data. Without more specific details about the model being referred to, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding which measures were taken to ensure its generalizability.
