The authors do not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, they mention that development sets were used to evaluate classification performance during experiments, while testing sets were used to evaluate the final classifier for each classification task. This suggests that the authors might have monitored the performance on the development set to decide when to stop training. Additionally, they discuss investigating the effect of using active learning to select training data, which implies that they may have considered factors like the size of the training data and its impact on peak performance. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the stopping criterion, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
