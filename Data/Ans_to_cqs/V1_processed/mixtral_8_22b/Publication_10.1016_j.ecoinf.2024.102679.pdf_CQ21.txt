After the model training, the postprocessing steps involve several stages. Firstly, the trained model undergoes inference and fine-tuning for four iterations using the entire SW stratum employing the SAL. This iterative process enhances the model's performance and gathers samples pertaining to each key species present in the region. The training procedure consists of two main steps: 1) training the architecture using positive patches for 200 epochs, and 2) collecting and including hard negative patches, which are patches containing false positives, to further train the model for 50 epochs in order to reduce the number of false positives. However, the text does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be inferred that these methods might not have been employed in this particular study.
