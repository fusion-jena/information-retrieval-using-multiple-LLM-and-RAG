The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, the text discusses the application of deep learning methods, specifically Stacked AutoEncoders (SAEs), in comparison to traditional machine learning methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for Landsat image classification. The focus of the research is on evaluating the hypothesis that incorporating phenological knowledge into deep learning models can enhance their performance in detecting invasive Spartina alterniflora.
