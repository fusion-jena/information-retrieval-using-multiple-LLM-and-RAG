The text does not provide explicit details about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, there is mention of an "automated expectation-maximization process" used for identifying the optimal number of cluster states and the data contained in each. Additionally, a "random walk with 300 steps for minimizing the MDL score" is mentioned, which could potentially be part of this optimization process. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot definitively determine whether techniques such as grid search or random search were employed for hyperparameter optimization.
