The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves automatic updates to model prototypes and the ability for users to trigger model training and view training metrics through the training tab. This process is designed to be largely automated to ensure accessibility to users who may not possess extensive knowledge in deep learning. Additionally, segmentation and classification endpoints are defined to allow users to customize the pipeline with their own models if desired.
