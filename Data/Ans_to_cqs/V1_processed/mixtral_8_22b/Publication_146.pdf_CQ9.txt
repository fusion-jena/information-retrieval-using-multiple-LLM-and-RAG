The information provided does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that a new dataset was created due to the lack of existing quality data, but it does not provide any details about where this dataset has been made publicly accessible or uploaded to a specific data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
