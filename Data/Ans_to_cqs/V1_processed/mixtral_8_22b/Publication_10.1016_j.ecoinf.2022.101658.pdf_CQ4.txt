The authors have implemented several data augmentation strategies to address the complexity of their multi-class semantic segmentation task and the lack of sufficient training images. These strategies include horizontal flipping, adding Gaussian noise, and reducing contrast. Horizontal flipping is a commonly used technique where images are mirrored along the vertical axis, effectively doubling the amount of available training data. Adding Gaussian noise involves introducing random pixel values drawn from a normal distribution, helping the model generalize better to noisy input. Lastly, reducing contrast specifically targets the issue of shadow occlusion on vegetation types, making the model more resilient to variations in lighting conditions.
