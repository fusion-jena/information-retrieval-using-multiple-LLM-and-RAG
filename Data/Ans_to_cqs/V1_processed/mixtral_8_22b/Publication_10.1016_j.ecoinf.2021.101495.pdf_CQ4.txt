The data augmentation techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline include variations in the orientation of individuals (image rotation), changes in contrast, and alterations in brightness. Specifically, each individual was positioned such that their longest axis was horizontal, allowing them to appear randomly in either a left-hand or right-hand view and with their head facing up or down. The missing rotations were then generated to create all possible orientations in which the model might encounter a fish. Subsequently, random adjustments to brightness and contrast were made using Equation 1, where each pixel x of the image was multiplied by α to modify the contrast and β was added to change the brightness. The values for α and β ranged within {α ∈ ℝ : 0.9 ≤ α ≤ 1.1} and {β ∈ ℕ : -4 ≤ β ≤ 4}, respectively.
