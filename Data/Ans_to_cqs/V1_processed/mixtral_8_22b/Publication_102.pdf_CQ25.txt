The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the description of the UNet model being employed as the learning model, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is likely used for semantic segmentation or object detection tasks. The UNet model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture initially proposed for biomedical image segmentation, which suggests that the model might be utilized for similar purposes in this case. Additionally, the mention of the 'U' shape of the architecture indicates that the model could also be used for object detection tasks, where the encoder-decoder structure helps capture spatial relationships between different parts of the input image.
