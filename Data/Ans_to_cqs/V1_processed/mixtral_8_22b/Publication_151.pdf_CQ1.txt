The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that branch lengths of the backbone species tree are estimated using sites randomly selected from the genes used in the experiments. This suggests that genetic data might have been collected for this purpose. Additionally, the text refers to a study that estimated branch lengths of the species tree under GTR+Î“ from 100 randomly selected sites from 381 marker genes. Therefore, it can be inferred that genetic data was likely collected through sequencing techniques or obtained from publicly available databases. Nevertheless, the specific method used for collecting raw data is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
