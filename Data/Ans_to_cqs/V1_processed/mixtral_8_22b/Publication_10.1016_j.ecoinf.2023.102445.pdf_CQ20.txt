The experiments are conducted on a consistent experimental platform that uses an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor with a Radeon graphics operating at 3.20 GHz. The graphics card used is an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU with 4 GB of video memory. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include both CPUs (AMD Ryzen 7 5800H) and GPUs (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti).
