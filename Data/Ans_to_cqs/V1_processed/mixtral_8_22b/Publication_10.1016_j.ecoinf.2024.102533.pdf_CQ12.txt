The paper by Jayasundara et al. titled "Deep learning for automated fish grading" published in December 2023 uses a deep learning model for fish grading. However, the specific type of deep learning model used in their pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined if they use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers based on the information available.
