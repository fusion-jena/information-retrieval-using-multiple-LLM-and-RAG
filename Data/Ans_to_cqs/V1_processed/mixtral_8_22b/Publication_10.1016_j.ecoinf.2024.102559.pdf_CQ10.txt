The given context does not provide information about the specific code repository link of any deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository containing such a pipeline. However, some of the references mentioned in the context may contain relevant information regarding the development and implementation of deep learning pipelines for remote sensing applications. For instance, Vali et al. (2020) review various deep learning approaches used for land use and land cover classification using hyperspectral and multispectral Earth observation data. Additionally, Blondel et al. (2011) discuss scikit-learn, a popular open-source library for machine learning in Python, which could potentially include tools for developing deep learning pipelines. Nevertheless, without further details or additional resources, it is impossible to pinpoint the precise location of a deep learning pipeline related to this topic.
