The text does not provide information on which specific cloud platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source software platform developed by Google, was utilized for implementing the deep learning algorithms in the project. Therefore, while there isn't explicit mention of a deployment platform, one could infer that Google Cloud Platform might have been considered due to its association with TensorFlow. Nonetheless, without further details, it remains speculative.
