After the model training process, there are various postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements and goals of the analysis. Based on the given context, it appears that the researchers performed several postprocessing tasks, including evaluating the performance of their models using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Relative Error (MRE), and Accuracy. These metrics were calculated based on the predictions made by the models on the test datasets. Additionally, they also analyzed the distribution of values in the training and test sets, as well as the precision of individual sensors. They also investigated the impact of weather conditions on the performance of the models. It is not explicitly mentioned whether saliency maps or confusion matrices were used in this study. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether these techniques were employed as part of the postprocessing steps.
