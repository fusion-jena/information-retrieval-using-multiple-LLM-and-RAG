To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) mentioned in the given context, several metrics can be employed. These include Mean Carbon Stock (Mean C), Coefficient of Determination (R^2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Mean Carbon Stock (Mean C): This metric represents the average carbon stock predicted by the model. In this case, the mean carbon stock is expressed in tons per hectare (t ha^-1).

Coefficient of Determination (R^2): R^2 measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in the model. It ranges between 0 and 1, where a higher value indicates better model fit.

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): RMSE quantifies the difference between the actual and predicted values. Lower RMSE values indicate smaller differences between the observed and predicted values, suggesting better model performance.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE calculates the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. Similar to RMSE, lower MAE values suggest better model performance.

These metrics have been applied to assess the prediction performance of the XGBoost and ANN models in estimating reforestation carbon stock using Planetscope's spectral information. As shown in Table 2, these metrics provide insights into how well each algorithm performs when applied to both calibration and validation datasets.
