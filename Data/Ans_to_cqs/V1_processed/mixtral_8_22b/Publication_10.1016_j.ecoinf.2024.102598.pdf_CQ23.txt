To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used, which included various features related to forest fires. This diversity helped in capturing different patterns and relationships present in the data, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design was employed during the model fitting process. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into 'k' subsets or folds, where one fold is used for testing and the rest for training. This process is repeated 'k' times, such that each fold serves as the test set once. In this study, a 10-fold CV design was used, meaning that the dataset was divided into ten equal parts, and the model was trained and tested ten times, each time with a different subset serving as the test set. This approach allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across different portions of the dataset, further enhancing its generalizability.

Thirdly, stratified sampling was applied when creating the folds for cross-validation. Stratification ensures that the distribution of classes in each fold remains similar to that in the original dataset. This is particularly important when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it prevents any single fold from having too many instances of a particular class, thus maintaining the overall balance and representation of classes in the dataset.

Lastly, the performance of each machine learning algorithm was thoroughly evaluated using various metrics like AUC, TSS, Kappa, and phi. This enabled the identification of the best performing models, which were then combined using the AUC-weighted ensemble method to create the final ensemble model. By utilizing the performance metrics to effectively combine the predictions from all models, this technique ensured that the final ensemble model would be capable of providing accurate and reliable results even when presented with new, unseen data.
