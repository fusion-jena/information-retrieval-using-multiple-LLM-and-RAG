Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines, to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which can lead to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, effectively creating a different network architecture for each iteration. This helps reduce interdependent learning among neurons and encourages them to learn individually useful features. Dropout has been shown to improve the performance of deep neural networks, especially those with many layers or parameters.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. By penalizing large weights, this method discourages complex models and encourages simpler ones, reducing the risk of overfitting. L2 regularization has been widely applied in various types of neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

In summary, both dropout and L2 regularization are popular regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. While dropout focuses on altering the network architecture during training, L2 regularization imposes constraints on the size of the weights. Both methods aim to achieve better generalization performance on new, unseen data.
