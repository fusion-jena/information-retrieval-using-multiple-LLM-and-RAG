The text does not provide information about the use of any specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. However, it mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as one of the machine learning models employed in building the ensemble models. ANNs are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by biological neural networks and are capable of modeling complex patterns and relationships in data. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes, also known as neurons, which receive input signals, apply weights to them, and pass them through activation functions before sending them to other connected neurons. Despite being a form of artificial intelligence, ANNs do not fall under the category of deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers, as they typically involve fewer hidden layers and simpler architectures compared to these more advanced deep learning techniques.
