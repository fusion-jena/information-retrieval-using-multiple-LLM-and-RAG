The text does not provide explicit information about specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that computer vision with deep learning involves teaching machines to interpret the content of images through training data - a set of manually labeled images. This implies that some form of labeling or annotating was performed on the images. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects within an image, while semantic segmentation entails assigning each pixel in an image to a class label. Instance segmentation combines both bounding boxes and semantic segmentation, where individual instances of objects are identified and outlined within an image. Without more specific details, it cannot be determined which of these techniques were employed in this particular case study.
