Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer from the dataset names such as G1\_Dataset1, G1\_Dataset2, etc., that they might have been collected using various means like surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Additionally, the paper references a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning, which suggests that some form of data collection was involved. But without more specific details about the source of each dataset, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
