The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the final model was fine-tuned by unfreezing the entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10^-4). This suggests that some form of gradient descent optimization algorithm was likely used, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). Without additional details, it cannot be definitively stated which specific optimization technique was employed.
