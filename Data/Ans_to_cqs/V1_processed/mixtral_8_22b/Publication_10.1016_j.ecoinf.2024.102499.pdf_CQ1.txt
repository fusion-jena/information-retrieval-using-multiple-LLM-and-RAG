The paper does not explicitly mention the specific method or tool used for collecting raw data. However, it mentions that the study uses Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) to collect data. BRUVS are a type of camera system used to observe marine life remotely without disturbing them. They consist of a baited container attached to a pole or frame, which is then lowered into the water. A camera is mounted on the frame to record the activity around the bait. This method allows researchers to observe marine animals in their natural habitat and gather data on their behavior, distribution, and abundance. It is likely that the raw data used in this study was collected through the use of BRUVS.
