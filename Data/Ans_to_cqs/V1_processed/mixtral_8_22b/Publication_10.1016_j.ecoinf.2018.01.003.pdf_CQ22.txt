The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, it mentions some metrics related to the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models. These include absolute error, relative error, root mean square error (RMSE), standard deviation, and learning time.

In general, common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Area Under Curve (AUC), confusion matrix, and log loss. Accuracy measures the ratio of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions. Precision indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Recall shows the fraction of relevant instances retrieved out of all relevant instances. F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric using their harmonic mean. AUC represents the degree or measure of separability, while confusion matrix provides detailed insights into the classification performance. Log loss quantifies the uncertainty of the classifier regarding its decision.

However, without additional context or information, we cannot determine if these commonly used deep learning evaluation metrics were applied to the models discussed in the provided text.
