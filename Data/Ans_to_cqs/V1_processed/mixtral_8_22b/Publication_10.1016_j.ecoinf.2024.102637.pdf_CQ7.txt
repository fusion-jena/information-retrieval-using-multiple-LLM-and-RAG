The given context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the dataset for deep learning model training, including the train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to randomly divide datasets into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. Typically, the ratio used for splitting the data is 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The purpose of having separate sets is to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data accurately.

In some cases, specific criteria may be applied when dividing the dataset, depending on the problem domain and available resources. For example, stratified sampling might be employed if there is a need to maintain the same distribution of classes across all subsets. Alternatively, one could opt for a temporal split if working with time series data. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the specific application or requirements mentioned in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact criteria used for splitting the dataset.
