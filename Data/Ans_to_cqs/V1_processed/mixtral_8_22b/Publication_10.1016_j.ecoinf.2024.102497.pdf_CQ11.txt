Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The text only mentions that the GF-6 (WFV) data was obtained from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application (<http://www.cresda.com/CN/>), but it does not specify any links to repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information with the given context.
