The given context does not directly discuss any specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on analyzing and filtering datasets from various sources like FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS for marine life studies. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based on the given context regarding the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
