The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided context.

However, generally speaking, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques help train machine learning models to identify and categorize objects within images accurately.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within an image, while semantic segmentation requires labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding object category. Instance segmentation combines both approaches, allowing for individual instances of objects to be identified and labeled separately.

Again, without more specific details from the given context, it is impossible to determine which data annotation technique was employed in this particular case.
