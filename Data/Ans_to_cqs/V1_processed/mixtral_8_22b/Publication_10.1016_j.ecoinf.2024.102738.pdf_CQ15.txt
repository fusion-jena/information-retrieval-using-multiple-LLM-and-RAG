The given context does not provide information about any specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). The text focuses mainly on the use of spectral indices, datasets, and sampling methods for land cover classification using Random Forest algorithms rather than discussing deep learning pipelines or their optimization techniques.
