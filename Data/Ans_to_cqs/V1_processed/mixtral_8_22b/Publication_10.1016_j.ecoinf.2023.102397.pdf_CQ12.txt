The text does not explicitly mention the use of a specific type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. However, it mentions the use of a random forest model, which is a machine learning algorithm based on decision trees rather than a deep learning model. Therefore, there is no clear indication of the use of any particular deep learning model in the given context.
