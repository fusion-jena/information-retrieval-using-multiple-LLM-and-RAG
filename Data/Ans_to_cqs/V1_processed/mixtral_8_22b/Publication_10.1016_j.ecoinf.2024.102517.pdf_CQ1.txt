The text does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that a dataset containing clean bird sounds was obtained, which consisted of 1568 clean bird sound segments with durations ranging from 4 to 20 seconds. From this dataset, 68 segments were randomly selected as the clean bird sound test set. It can be inferred that the raw data collection process involved recording bird sounds, but the specific method or source of these recordings is not mentioned. Therefore, it remains unclear whether they were collected through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other means.
