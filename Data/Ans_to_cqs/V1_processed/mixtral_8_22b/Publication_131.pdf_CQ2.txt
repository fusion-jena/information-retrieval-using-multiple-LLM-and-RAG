The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses audio data for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for anuran call classification. However, it also mentions creating an image representation of the audio energy in a time and frequency graph, which implies that the actual input format for the CNN might be images rather than raw audio files. Therefore, both audio and image data formats are involved in the deep learning pipeline.
