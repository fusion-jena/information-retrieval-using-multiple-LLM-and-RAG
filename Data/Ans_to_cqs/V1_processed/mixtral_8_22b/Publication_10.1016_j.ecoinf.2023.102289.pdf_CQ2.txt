In the given context, the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data. The input consists of images, which are processed using semantic segmentation techniques to identify different landscape elements. After processing, the output is provided in CSV format for easier integration with other datasets or further statistical analysis. Therefore, the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline include image files for input and CSV files for output.
