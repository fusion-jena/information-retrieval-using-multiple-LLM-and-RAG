The context does not provide specific information about regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that optimization-based methods like those proposed by Finn et al. (2017) and others are designed to adapt quickly to new tasks, allowing them to learn a classification task with few examples. These methods involve pre-training a model with existing databases on different tasks so it can adapt easily to a new one. This process helps prevent overfitting by exposing the model to diverse data during training. Additionally, the context discusses data augmentation techniques (Van Dyk and Meng, 2012; Wang and Perez, 2017; Wong et al., 2016) which can also help reduce overfitting by increasing the amount of available training data.
