The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it is mentioned that they explored different hyperparameters and chose the ones that gave the best results for training the final model. This suggests that some form of optimization or tuning process was used, but without further details, it cannot be confirmed whether this was done through methods such as grid search, random search, or other techniques like Bayesian Optimization or Gradient Descent.
