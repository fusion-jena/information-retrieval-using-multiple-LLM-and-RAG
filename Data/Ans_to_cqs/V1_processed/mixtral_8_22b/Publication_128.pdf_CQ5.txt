The given context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning research, some possible datasets include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. These datasets are widely used for benchmarking various deep learning architectures such as AlexNet and ResNet mentioned in the context.

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits commonly used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is grayscale and has a fixed size of 28x28 pixels.

CIFAR is another popular dataset used for object recognition tasks. It contains 60,000 color images divided into two subsets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. CIFAR-10 consists of 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 has 100 classes. Each subset includes 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

ImageNet is a large-scale dataset containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. It is often used for training deep learning models for image classification tasks. The dataset is organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, where each node represents a category.

Without explicit mention of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context, we can only speculate that they may have been chosen from among these commonly used options.
