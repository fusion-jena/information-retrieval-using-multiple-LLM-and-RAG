The text does not provide explicit information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some commonly used evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. F1 score combines both precision and recall into one metric. ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while AUC represents the degree of separability between classes. It should be noted that the choice of evaluation metrics depends on the problem domain and the desired outcome. Without further context, it cannot be determined which specific metrics were used in this case.
