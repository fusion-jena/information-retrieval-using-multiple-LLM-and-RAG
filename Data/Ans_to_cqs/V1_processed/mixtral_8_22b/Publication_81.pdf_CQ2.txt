In the given context, the authors describe a deep learning method for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. They use DNA sequences as input data, align them to have the same length, and convert them into numerical data using one-hot encoding. This indicates that the data format used in their deep learning pipeline is not directly related to common multimedia formats like images, audio, or video but rather involves processing genetic information. Specifically, they work with DNA sequences represented numerically after alignment and conversion via one-hot encoding.
