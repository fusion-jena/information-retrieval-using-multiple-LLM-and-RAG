After model training, there are various postprocessing steps that can be taken depending on the specific requirements of the project or application. Some common postprocessing steps include:

* Saliency maps: These are used to highlight important features in the input data that contribute most to the model's predictions. This can help identify which parts of the input data are most relevant for making accurate predictions.
* Metrics calculation: After training, it is often useful to calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of the model. These metrics provide insight into how well the model is able to classify or predict the target variable.
* Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, allowing for easy comparison between different models or algorithms.

Other possible postprocessing steps may include feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods. The choice of postprocessing steps will depend on the specific goals and constraints of the project.
