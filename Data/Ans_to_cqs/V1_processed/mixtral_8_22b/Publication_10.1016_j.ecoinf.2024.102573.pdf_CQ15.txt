In the given context, the deep learning pipeline uses the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2017) with default hyperparameters. Additionally, a cosine decay scheduler is employed for adjusting the learning rate during training. These optimization techniques contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the deep learning process.

Adam (short for Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning due to its ability to adaptively update the learning rates based on first and second moments of gradients. This makes it well suited for handling noisy or sparse gradients, which often occur in large-scale machine learning problems. By combining the advantages of both RMSprop and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum, Adam provides efficient convergence properties and robustness against different hyperparameter settings.

Apart from choosing an appropriate optimizer like Adam, another common practice in deep learning pipelines is employing learning rate schedules. In this case, a cosine decay schedule is utilized. Learning rate schedules help improve the stability and speed of the training process by gradually reducing the learning rate over time. A cosine decay schedule decreases the learning rate according to a cosine curve, allowing for smoother transitions between learning phases and potentially better generalization performance.
