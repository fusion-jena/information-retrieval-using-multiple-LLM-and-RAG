The text provides information about several deep learning models used in the study, including PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks. However, it only explicitly mentions the use of data augmentation techniques for the classification networks. According to the text, the data augmentation techniques applied during the training of the classification networks include height and width shifts, flips, zooms, and brightness changes. These techniques help improve the robustness and generalizability of the models by introducing variations into the training data.
