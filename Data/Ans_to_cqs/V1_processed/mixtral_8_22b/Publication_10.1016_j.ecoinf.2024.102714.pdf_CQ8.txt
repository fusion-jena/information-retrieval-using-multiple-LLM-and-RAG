Unfortunately, the given context does not provide any information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses various steps involved in improving the accuracy of land cover classification models and their results but does not mention anything related to the code repository or its availability on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based solely on this context.
