The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that model hyperparameters were tuned for each species-specific model using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation with ten folds. This suggests that the training process may have been considered complete once the RMSE reached a satisfactory level or stopped improving significantly. Additionally, the use of Bayesian optimization implies that the training process might have continued until the most promising set of hyperparameters was identified.
