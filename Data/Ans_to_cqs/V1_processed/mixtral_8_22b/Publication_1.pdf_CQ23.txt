Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used for large scale biodiversity monitoring. However, some common methods used to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, regularization techniques, early stopping, and transfer learning. It is likely that one or more of these methods were employed to enhance the robustness and reliability of the model. Additionally, the paper mentions that the performance of the deep learning algorithm scales well with the number of training examples and the amount of compute cycles applied, which suggests that a large and varied dataset may have been used to train the model.
