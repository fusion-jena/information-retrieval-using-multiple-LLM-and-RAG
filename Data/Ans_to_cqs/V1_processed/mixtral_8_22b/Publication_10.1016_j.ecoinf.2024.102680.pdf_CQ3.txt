The text does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that general deep learning networks have difficulty accurately capturing feature information and detecting objects correctly due to insufficient clarity of underwater optical images. It also discusses improvements made to the original YOLOv8 network for better feature extraction and object detection. These improvements include using dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, the text mentions combining the strengths of pyramid vision transformers and CNNs in a dual-path approach to effectively extract both global and local features from underwater images. While these techniques improve network performance, they generally require a significant amount of underwater image data for training and demand substantial computational resources.

Regarding data annotation techniques, common approaches in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within an image, while instance segmentation requires outlining individual instances of objects. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image according to its class or category. Depending on the specific application and dataset, different annotation techniques may be more appropriate. For example, bounding box annotation might be sufficient for simple object detection tasks, whereas instance segmentation could be necessary for more complex applications requiring precise delineation of individual objects.
