The text does not provide explicit information about the specific cloud platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the model was trained on a GPU platform, specifically using TITAN Xp GPUs. It also states that the model was trained on one or three GPUs depending on the iteration. Therefore, we cannot determine if a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform was used based solely on this information.
