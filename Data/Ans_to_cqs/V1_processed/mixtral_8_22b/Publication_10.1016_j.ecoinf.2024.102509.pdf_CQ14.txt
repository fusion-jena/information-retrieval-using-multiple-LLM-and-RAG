The text does not provide specific details about how the hyperparameters of the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model were optimized. However, it is mentioned that hyperparameter tuning was carried out to ensure the reliability of the ANN models. This suggests that some form of optimization technique was employed, but the exact method (such as grid search or random search) remains unspecified within the given information.
