The text does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the authors in one study used pre-trained DNNs on the ImageNet dataset [30]. Also, they mentioned using the VnPollenBee dataset for their experiments. Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline include the ImageNet dataset and the VnPollenBee dataset.
