The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs and inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. This suggests that some form of parameter optimization or tuning was performed during training, but the specific method (grid search, random search, etc.) is not mentioned.
