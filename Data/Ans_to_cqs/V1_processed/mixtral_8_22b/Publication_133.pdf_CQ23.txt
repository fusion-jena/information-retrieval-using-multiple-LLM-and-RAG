To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model was trained using diverse datasets consisting of various insect species, including Glycaspis, Psyllaephagus, and Thaumastocoris. This diversity helped prevent the model from being biased towards any specific type of insect, thus improving its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Secondly, the concept of validation data was employed during the training process. Validation data refers to a subset of the entire dataset that is withheld from the training phase and used solely for evaluation purposes. By continuously monitoring the model's performance on the validation data, it was possible to detect signs of overfitting early on and take appropriate actions to mitigate it. Lastly, the study utilized 30 epochs per training task, which was determined through extensive validation runs. An epoch represents one complete pass through the entire dataset, allowing the model to learn from every sample. Using a sufficient number of epochs ensured that the model had enough exposure to the dataset, further enhancing its capacity to generalize effectively.
