The context does not provide explicit details about how the dataset was divided into training, testing, or validation sets. However, it mentions that the study involves binary classification using TrunkNet, which is supervised by the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function. This implies that the dataset has been labeled accordingly for the two classes involved in the binary classification task. Typically, datasets are randomly split into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Lastly, the test set evaluates the final model's performance after training and tuning have been completed. In summary, although the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not mentioned in the given context, common practices include random splitting into training, validation, and test sets based on the requirements of the problem being addressed.
