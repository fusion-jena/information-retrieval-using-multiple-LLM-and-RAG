Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it discusses the use of varying dataset sizes in the context of WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform - Hidden Markov Model) for detecting North Atlantic right whale up-calls. It mentions that larger datasets provide models with more diverse examples, which aid in the generalization of learned features and patterns. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective model training. Additionally, it highlights the scalability of the WT-HMM, indicating its effectiveness for smaller datasets and its ability to scale well as the dataset size increases. Therefore, while the exact datasets used are not specified, the context implies the use of varying dataset sizes related to bioacoustic monitoring, specifically for detecting North Atlantic right whale up-calls.
