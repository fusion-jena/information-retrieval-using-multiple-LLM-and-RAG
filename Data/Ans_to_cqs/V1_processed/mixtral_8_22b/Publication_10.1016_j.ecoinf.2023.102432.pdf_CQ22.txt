The text mentions that the overall, producer, and user accuracy were reported for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model. These metrics are derived from the confusion matrix, which is also mentioned as being calculated. The confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each column represents the instances in an actual class. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the classifier. From this matrix, various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall can be computed. However, the text specifically mentions the use of overall, producer, and user accuracy. Overall accuracy is the proportion of all samples that were classified correctly. Producer accuracy refers to the probability that a certain area on the ground is classified as such. User accuracy is the probability that a certain class on the map actually represents that class on the ground.
