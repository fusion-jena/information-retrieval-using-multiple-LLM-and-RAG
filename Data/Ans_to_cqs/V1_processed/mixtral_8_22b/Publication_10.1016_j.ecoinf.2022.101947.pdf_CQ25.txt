The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is for classification. Specifically, it is used to classify images of tiger footprints (also known as trails) to identify individual tigers based on their unique characteristics. The model uses a pairwise comparison approach within the FIT framework to create a classification dendrogram. The goal is to minimize misclassifications and achieve high accuracy in identifying individual tigers. The model has been trained using data from captive Amur tigers and tested on trails collected from free-ranging Amur tigers of unknown identity.
