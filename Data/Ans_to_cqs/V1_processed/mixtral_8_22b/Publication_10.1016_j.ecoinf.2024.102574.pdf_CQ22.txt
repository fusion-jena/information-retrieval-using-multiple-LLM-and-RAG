The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it mentions some common evaluation metrics such as R2 and RMSE in the context of measuring the accuracy of aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation. These metrics are often used to assess the goodness of fit between predicted and observed values in regression models. Additionally, the paper cites other studies related to remote sensing and geospatial analysis, which might have employed various evaluation metrics depending on their respective objectives and methodologies. Therefore, without further context or information, it cannot be definitively stated what specific metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
