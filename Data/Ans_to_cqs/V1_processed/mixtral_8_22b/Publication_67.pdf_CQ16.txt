The context does not provide explicit information regarding the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it mentions that the internal validation used the performance obtained by classifying 20% of the images from the training dataset while 80% was used in the training phase. This suggests that the training process might have been stopped once the desired level of performance was achieved during this internal validation step. Additionally, the use of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques could also influence the decision on when to stop training. Unfortunately, there is no clear indication of whether validation loss plateau or any other specific criterion was employed to decide when the training should be concluded.
