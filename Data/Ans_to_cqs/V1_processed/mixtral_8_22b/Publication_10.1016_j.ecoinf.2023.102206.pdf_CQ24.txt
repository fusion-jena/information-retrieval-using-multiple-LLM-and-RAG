The given context does not provide information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be applied to manage randomness in deep learning models. These include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing ensemble methods to average results from multiple runs, and using techniques like dropout or batch normalization to introduce controlled noise into the model.
