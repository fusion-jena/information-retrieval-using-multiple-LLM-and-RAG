The given context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. The authors have mentioned the use of different classifiers such as Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). However, they did not discuss any specific method used for hyperparameter optimization like Grid Search or Random Search. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
