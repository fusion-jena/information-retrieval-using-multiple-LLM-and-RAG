Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a direct link to the data repository used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. It appears that the authors worked with biology experts from the MARBEC laboratory to label many videos and create a training database consisting of 13,000 fish thumbnails. However, no specific details about the location or accessibility of this dataset are provided. Therefore, without additional information, it is impossible to determine if the dataset has been made publicly accessible through platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
