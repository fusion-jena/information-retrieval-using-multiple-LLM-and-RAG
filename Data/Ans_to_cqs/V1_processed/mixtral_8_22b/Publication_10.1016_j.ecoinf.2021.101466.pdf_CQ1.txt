The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions using data augmentation techniques to prepare 4000 images for each category to train the EfficientNet model. This suggests that the raw data might have been collected through image acquisition methods such as cameras or other visual sensors. Additionally, the mention of keeping costs minimal when creating variations in training data implies that publicly available datasets could be one source of raw data collection. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact methods are employed for gathering raw data in this particular case.
