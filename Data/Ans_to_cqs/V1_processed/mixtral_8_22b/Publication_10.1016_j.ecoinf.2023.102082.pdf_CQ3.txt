The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that convolutional neural networks were employed, which suggests that some form of image labeling or annotation was likely involved. Common techniques for such tasks include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Without further information, it is impossible to determine precisely which technique was utilized in this case.

Based on the context, we can infer that the authors made use of two datasets - Lang10m and Potapov30m - both derived from LiDAR GEDI CHMs. These datasets were then used to estimate the HH (horizontal heterogeneity) of forests. The authors also mention that they made use of machine learning algorithms to produce these datasets. However, there is no explicit mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, without additional information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed response to the query.
