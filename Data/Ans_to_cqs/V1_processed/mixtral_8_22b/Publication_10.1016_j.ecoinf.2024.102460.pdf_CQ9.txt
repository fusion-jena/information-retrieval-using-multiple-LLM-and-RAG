According to the given information, it appears that the data used in the study can be requested directly from the authors. However, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It may be necessary to contact the corresponding author(s) for further clarification on this matter.
