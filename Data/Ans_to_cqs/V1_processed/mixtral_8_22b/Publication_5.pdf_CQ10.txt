The information regarding the specific code repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this information alone. However, it does mention that TensorFlow (<https://tensorflow.org>) was used to develop their species richness estimation model. This suggests that they might have utilized existing libraries and frameworks available within TensorFlow for building their deep learning pipeline. Unfortunately, without further details about the project or its authors, it would be impossible to provide a direct link to any potential code repositories related to this work.
