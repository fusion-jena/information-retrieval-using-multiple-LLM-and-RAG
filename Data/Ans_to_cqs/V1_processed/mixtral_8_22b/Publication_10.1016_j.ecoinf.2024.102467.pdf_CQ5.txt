Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline involving EfficientNetV2. However, it does reference a study by Liu and Wang (2021) where they applied EfficientNetV2 to a benthic organism dataset, achieving higher accuracy than the original Faster R-CNN algorithm. Therefore, one known dataset used in conjunction with EfficientNetV2 is a benthic organism dataset. Unfortunately, without more information about the research conducted by Liu and Wang, we cannot provide details regarding the nature or source of this particular dataset.
