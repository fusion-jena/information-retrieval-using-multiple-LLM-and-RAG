Based on the given context, there is no direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility or employing techniques like cross-validation and ensemble methods to reduce variability caused by random initialization. In this case, the authors use a specific dataset (WSGD) for training, validation, and testing their Res\_AUNet network, which could help minimize the impact of randomness. Additionally, they compare their method with other models like UNet, UNet++, PSPNet, and HRNet, further demonstrating its effectiveness despite potential variations due to randomness.
