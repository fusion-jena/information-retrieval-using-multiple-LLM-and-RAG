After the model training phase, there are several postprocessing steps that can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the task or application. Some common postprocessing techniques include:

* Saliency maps: These visualize the regions of input images that contribute most significantly to the output predictions made by the model. They help identify important features and patterns learned by the model during training.

* Metrics calculation: Various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., can be calculated based on the predicted labels and ground truth labels. This helps evaluate the effectiveness of the trained model.

* Confusion matrix: It provides a summary of the classification performance of the model, showing true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives. This allows us to understand how well the model distinguishes between different classes.

In addition to these, other postprocessing tasks may involve fine-tuning hyperparameters, applying regularization techniques, pruning unnecessary connections, or even retraining the model with additional data. However, the exact postprocessing steps will depend on the specific problem domain and goals of the project.
