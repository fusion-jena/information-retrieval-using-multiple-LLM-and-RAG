The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the data might include presence-only samples, which could potentially be in various formats like CSV, JSON, or others. Additionally, since the text discusses using remote sensing data, it suggests that the data could also include images or satellite data. Furthermore, given that the topic revolves around species distribution modeling, it's plausible that geospatial data formats like GeoTIFF or Shapefiles might also be utilized. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the source material, these assumptions remain speculative.
