The given context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it can be assumed that common practices were followed, which typically involve splitting the dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set.

The training set is used to fit the parameters of the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters or select models during the development process. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the fully specified model. The proportion of each subset may vary depending on the size of the dataset and specific requirements of the project. Common splits include 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing, or 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.
