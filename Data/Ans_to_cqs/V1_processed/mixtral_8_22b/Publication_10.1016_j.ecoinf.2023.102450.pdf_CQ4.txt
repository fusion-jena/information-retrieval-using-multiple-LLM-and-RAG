The given context does not provide specific information regarding the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These methods help increase the size and diversity of training datasets, which can improve model performance and generalization. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and dataset being addressed. For example, flipping may not be suitable for certain types of images where orientation matters, such as those containing text or objects with a clear top and bottom. Similarly, rotation might distort features if applied excessively. Therefore, careful consideration should be taken when selecting appropriate data augmentation techniques for a particular application.
