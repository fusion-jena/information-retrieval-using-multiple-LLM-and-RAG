The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this query based solely on the given information. However, it is worth noting that the context discusses the use of deep learning strategies such as neural networks in ecological modeling, which may involve image analysis tasks like object detection or semantic segmentation. These tasks often require data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation to create labeled datasets for training deep learning models. Nevertheless, without further details about the specific deep learning pipelines employed in these studies, I can only speculate on the potential data annotation techniques used.
