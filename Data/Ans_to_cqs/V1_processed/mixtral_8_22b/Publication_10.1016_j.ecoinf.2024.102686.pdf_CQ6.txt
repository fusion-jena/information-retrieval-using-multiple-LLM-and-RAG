Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

* Normalization or standardization: This involves rescaling the features so they have zero mean and unit variance. This helps prevent any one feature from dominating the others due to differences in scales.
* Scaling: Similar to normalization, but instead of rescaling based on the mean and variance, we rescale based on the minimum and maximum values.
* Cleaning: Removing missing or invalid data points, handling outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.
* Feature engineering: Creating new features from existing ones, such as polynomial features or interaction terms, to better capture relationships in the data.
* Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of features through techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or autoencoders.

These preprocessing steps help ensure that the deep learning model can effectively learn patterns in the data and generalize well to new examples.
