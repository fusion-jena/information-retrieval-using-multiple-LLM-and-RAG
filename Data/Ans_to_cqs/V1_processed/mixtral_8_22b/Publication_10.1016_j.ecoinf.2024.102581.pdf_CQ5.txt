Based on the given context, it appears that two datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline: Pine Tree Classification and Plant Leaf Disease Classification. However, there is no mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used. Additionally, the context mentions the use of the CVIP100 dataset, but does not provide further details about this dataset. Therefore, based on the information available, we cannot definitively determine which standard datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
