Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These may include data cleaning, where missing or irrelevant values are removed from the dataset. Normalization and scaling techniques are also commonly used to ensure that all features have similar scales, which helps prevent any single feature from dominating the others during training. This can involve converting numerical values into a common range such as between 0 and 1 (min-max normalization), or transforming them so they follow a standard distribution like Gaussian (z-score normalization). Additionally, it might be necessary to encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding methods depending on the nature of the problem being solved. Other preprocessing steps could include augmenting the dataset with additional samples generated from existing ones, balancing classes if there is class imbalance, or even reducing dimensionality for computational efficiency. However, these specific preprocessing steps will depend largely on the type of data being used and the requirements of the particular deep learning task.
