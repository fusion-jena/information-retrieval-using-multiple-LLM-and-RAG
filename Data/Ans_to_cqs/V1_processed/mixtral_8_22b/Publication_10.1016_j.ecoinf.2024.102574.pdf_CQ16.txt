The provided context does not directly address the specific criteria used to determine when machine learning model training is complete. However, a common criterion mentioned in literature is the validation loss plateau. When the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, it may indicate overfitting, suggesting that further training will not improve the model's performance on unseen data. Other possible criteria include reaching a predefined number of epochs, achieving a target accuracy level, or observing no improvement in validation metrics after several consecutive epochs.
