The information provided does not include any details about a specific deep learning pipeline or its corresponding data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, some commonly used repositories for sharing datasets are mentioned, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. These platforms can host various types of research data, including those generated by deep learning pipelines. To find out if the dataset you are looking for is hosted on one of these platforms, please search their respective websites using relevant keywords or contact the authors of the papers listed above for more information.
