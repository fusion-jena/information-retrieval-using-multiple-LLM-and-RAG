The deep learning pipeline described uses two primary datasets: the ImageNet dataset and the Pl@ntNet dataset. The ImageNet dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset consisting of millions of labeled images across thousands of categories. In this case, it was used to initially train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture employed, specifically the inception model with batch normalization. After initial training on ImageNet, the network was fine-tuned using the Pl@ntNet dataset, which consists of over 2.9 million images covering 30,261 different plant species. This fine-tuning process allows the network to specialize in identifying plants based on the specific features present in the Pl@ntNet dataset.
