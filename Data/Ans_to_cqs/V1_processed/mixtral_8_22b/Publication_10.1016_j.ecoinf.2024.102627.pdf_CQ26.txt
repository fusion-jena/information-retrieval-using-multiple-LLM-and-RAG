The text does not provide explicit details about specific techniques used for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the species assemblage predictor is impacted by species detection bias, which means that some species might be observed more or less frequently than others, leading to potential exclusion or false inclusion in the predicted assemblage.

To mitigate such issues, one could consider using various techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, ensuring each subset maintains the same class proportions as the original dataset. Oversampling and undersampling involve increasing or decreasing the number of instances in minority or majority classes, respectively, to balance the dataset. Lastly, collecting diverse data helps ensure that different species are represented equally in the dataset.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they could potentially help address the species detection bias issue discussed.
