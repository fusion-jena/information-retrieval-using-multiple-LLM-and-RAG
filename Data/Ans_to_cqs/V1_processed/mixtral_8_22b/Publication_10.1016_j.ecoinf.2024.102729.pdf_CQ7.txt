In this study, the dataset was randomly divided into two subsets for deep learning model training. The first subset was used as a training dataset to learn the optimal model structure, while the second subset was used as a validation dataset to test its performance. Approximately 75% of the data were devoted to model training, and 25% to testing. Random sampling was employed instead of cluster sampling, with the main condition being to maintain the covariance structure among the predictor variables relatively intact between the training and testing datasets. This approach leverages the well-documented robustness of RF algorithms to randomly receive training data from subsets and establish models with high predictive capacity.
