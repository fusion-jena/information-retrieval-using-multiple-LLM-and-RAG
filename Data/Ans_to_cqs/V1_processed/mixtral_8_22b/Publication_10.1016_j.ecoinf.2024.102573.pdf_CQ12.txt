The text does not explicitly state which specific type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, it mentions that convolutional networks were trained directly on the CQT, suggesting the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, the text discusses the exploration of various types of neural networks using Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) and its relatives, such as mel-filterbanks applied on STFT (mel-spectrogram) and MFCC, further implying the utilization of CNNs. Furthermore, the mention of LEAF-P and SincNet-P as learnable frontends suggests the application of custom or modified versions of existing models, possibly based on CNN architectures. In summary, although the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not specified, there are strong indications that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play a significant role in the process.
