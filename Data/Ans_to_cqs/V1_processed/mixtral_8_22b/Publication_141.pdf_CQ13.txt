Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, we can infer some general information about the model's configuration.

The text mentions that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model uses a two-stage training process. In the first stage, only the top classifier (fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. This suggests that transfer learning was employed, possibly using a well-known architecture like VGG16 or ResNet.

In the second stage, the entire network is fine-tuned using smaller learning rates. This indicates that the initial learning rate might have been higher during the first stage, but without explicit values, we cannot confirm this assumption. Additionally, the use of smaller learning rates during fine-tuning implies that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer or its variants could have been utilized, as they are commonly paired with learning rate schedules.

Furthermore, the context states that data augmentation was applied by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. This technique helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize. Dropout techniques were also implemented to enhance model robustness, suggesting that regularization methods were considered during the development of the deep learning model.

Lastly, the model was developed using Python programming language, Keras high-level deep learning library, and TensorFlow with GPU execution as the backend engine. These tools offer various options for setting hyperparameters, including different optimizers, learning rates, batch sizes, and epoch numbers. Without more specific information, however, we cannot definitively state the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
