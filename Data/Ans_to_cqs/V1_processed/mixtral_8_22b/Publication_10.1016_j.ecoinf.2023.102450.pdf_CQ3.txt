In the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines for object detection and image classification tasks, it can be inferred that some form of data annotation would have been employed.

For example, in the paper by Clune et al. (2018), which discusses automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning, it is likely that some form of data annotation technique was used to label the images for training the deep learning models. Similarly, in the paper by Okafor et al. (2016), which compares deep learning and bag of visual words for wild-animal recognition, it is also probable that data annotation techniques were utilized to prepare the datasets for model training.

Bounding box annotation is a commonly used data annotation technique for object detection tasks, where objects within an image are enclosed within rectangular boxes along with corresponding labels. Instance segmentation is another popular data annotation technique used for more precise object identification, where individual pixels belonging to an object are labeled instead of enclosing them within a rectangle.

Without further information regarding the specific papers mentioned in the context, it cannot be definitively stated which data annotation techniques were used. Nonetheless, it can be assumed that some form of data annotation was necessary to prepare the datasets for training the deep learning models discussed in these papers.
