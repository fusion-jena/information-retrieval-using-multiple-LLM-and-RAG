The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) Score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision indicates the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall calculates the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. F1-Score combines both precision and recall into one metric, providing a more balanced measure of the model's performance. Lastly, the AUC Score represents the degree or measure of separability between classes, indicating how well the model can distinguish between different classes. These metrics help assess the effectiveness and reliability of the deep learning model in accurately classifying mosquito species.
