The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, various methods can be employed for gathering raw data, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Data collection through structured or unstructured questionnaires, interviews, or observations. This method is commonly used in social sciences, market research, and other fields where human input is required.

2. Sensors: Devices designed to detect changes in their environment and convert them into electrical signals. Examples include temperature sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, cameras, microphones, and GPS devices. These sensors are widely used in IoT applications, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and more.

3. Public Datasets: Pre-existing datasets made available by organizations, researchers, or government agencies. These datasets can be used directly or after some preprocessing steps. Some popular sources of public datasets include UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, Google Dataset Search, and AWS Open Data Registry.

Without further context, it is impossible to specify which of these methods was used in this particular scenario.
