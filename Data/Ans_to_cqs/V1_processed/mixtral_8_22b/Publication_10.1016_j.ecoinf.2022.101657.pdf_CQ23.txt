To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures have been taken. Firstly, the model was initially pre-trained using the MS-COCO dataset, which is a diverse dataset containing various objects and scenes. This helps the model learn a wide range of features that can be useful for identifying different species in camera trap images.

Secondly, the model was then fine-tuned using the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) dataset, which is specifically designed for wildlife monitoring. By training on this dataset, the model becomes more specialized in recognizing animals commonly found in wildlife habitats. Furthermore, the recommended data split of the WCS dataset was followed during training, ensuring that the model is evaluated on unseen data, thus reducing the risk of overfitting.

Lastly, while there isn't explicit mention of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context, the Mean Average Precision (mAP50) metric used to evaluate the model's performance inherently considers the balance between precision and recall across different classes. This means that even if certain species are underrepresented in the dataset, the model will still aim to accurately classify them, promoting fairness and preventing bias towards dominant classes.
