The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is primarily for pest counting within a given region of interest (RoI). This is achieved through the implementation of the pest counting module PCÎ¸, which utilizes various deep learning techniques. The main counting strategies employed here include counting by detection, where bounding boxes are computed, and counting by regression, where a target map is predicted. For the regression-based approach, two different methods relying on distinct regressed target maps are explored: counting by density estimation and counting by segmentation. Therefore, the deep learning model serves the purpose of accurately estimating the number of insects present in the RoI, contributing to efficient pest management practices.
