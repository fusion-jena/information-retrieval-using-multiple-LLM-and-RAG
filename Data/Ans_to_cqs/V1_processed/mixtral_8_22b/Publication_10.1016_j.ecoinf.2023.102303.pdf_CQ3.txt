Based on the given information, the authors have mentioned that they collected a new fish dataset called FishInTurbidWater and weakly labeled it. However, there is no specific mention of the exact data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline.

Data annotation techniques can vary depending on the task and the type of data being analyzed. Common techniques include bounding box annotation, where objects within images or videos are outlined with rectangles, and instance segmentation, where each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. Other methods include semantic segmentation, key point annotation, and polygon annotation.

Since the authors did not explicitly specify the data annotation techniques used, it cannot be determined if any of these common techniques were employed. Nevertheless, based on the fact that they mentioned weak labeling, it could imply that they might have used a form of coarse-grained labeling, such as assigning labels to entire images rather than individual instances within them.

Therefore, without further clarification from the authors regarding the specific data annotation techniques used, it remains uncertain what precise methods were implemented in their deep learning pipeline.
