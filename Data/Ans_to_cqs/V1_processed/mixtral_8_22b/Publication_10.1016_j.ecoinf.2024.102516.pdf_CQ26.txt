The article does not provide explicit details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in machine learning, some common techniques to handle data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into different subsets or strata, ensuring that each subset contains roughly equal proportions of classes. This technique can help maintain class balance when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Oversampling refers to increasing the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic examples. Undersampling, conversely, reduces the majority class by removing instances randomly or selecting those most representative of their respective classes. Both methods aim to achieve balanced class distributions.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering more varied and comprehensive data to reduce potential biases introduced by limited sources or perspectives. By incorporating various types of data, models may become more robust and accurate in handling real-world scenarios.
