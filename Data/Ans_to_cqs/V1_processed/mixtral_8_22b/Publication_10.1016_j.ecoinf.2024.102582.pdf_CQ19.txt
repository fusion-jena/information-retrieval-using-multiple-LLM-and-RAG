The papers cited do not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks were used to build their models. However, some clues can be found in the paper by Lassalle et al. (2022). They discuss using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very high-resolution satellite imagery. While they do not specify the exact framework used, popular choices for building CNN architectures include TensorFlow and PyTorch. Additionally, the paper by Liang et al. (2023) mentions using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for analyzing land use/cover change dynamics. Although GEE is not a deep learning framework itself, it can be integrated with other tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing deep learning applications. Therefore, while there is no definitive answer, it is likely that one or both of these popular deep learning frameworks were employed in the research.
