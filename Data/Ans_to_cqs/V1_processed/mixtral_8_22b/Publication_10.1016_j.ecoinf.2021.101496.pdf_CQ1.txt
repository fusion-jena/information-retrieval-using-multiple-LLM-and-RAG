The sources provided discuss various methods used for gathering data related to plant chlorophyll content, growth prediction, and monitoring agricultural crops. These methods can be considered part of the deep learning pipeline for applications in precision agriculture.

In the paper "Quantification of plant chlorophyll content using Google Glass" [1], Cortazar et al. use wearable technology equipped with a camera to capture images of plants. This method allows for non-destructive measurement of chlorophyll content, which is essential for assessing plant health and productivity.

Remote sensing methods are employed in the study conducted by Dom√≠nguez et al. [2] to predict the growth of winter oilseed rape and winter wheat. Remote sensing involves using satellite or airborne sensors to collect data about the Earth's surface, including vegetation characteristics such as biomass, leaf area index, and chlorophyll content.

In the research article "Economical thermal-RGB imaging system for monitoring agricultural crops" [7], Osroosh et al. describe an imaging system that combines thermal and RGB cameras to monitor crop health. Thermal imaging provides information about plant temperature, which can indicate stress or disease, while RGB imaging captures color information useful for identifying different plant species and assessing their health.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of a handheld device called SPAD-502Plus for measuring chlorophyll content in leaves. This tool employs light transmission principles to estimate chlorophyll concentration based on the absorption properties of leaves.

Overall, these studies demonstrate the utilization of diverse methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, including wearable devices, remote sensing techniques, multi-spectral imaging systems, and handheld tools like SPAD-502Plus. Each method has its advantages and limitations, making it crucial to select the most appropriate technique depending on the specific application and available resources.
