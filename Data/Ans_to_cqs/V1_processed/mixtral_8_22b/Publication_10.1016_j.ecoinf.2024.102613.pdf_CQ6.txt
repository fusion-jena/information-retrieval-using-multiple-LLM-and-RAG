Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be required to ensure the quality and usability of the dataset. These steps include:

1. Data Cleansing: This involves removing any irrelevant, corrupt, or duplicate data points from the dataset. It also includes handling missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or dropping those records altogether.

2. Data Transformation: This step involves changing the structure or format of the data to suit the requirements of the deep learning algorithm. Common transformations include encoding categorical variables into numerical ones, normalizing or standardizing numerical columns, and reshaping the data matrix according to the network architecture.

3. Data Compression: Depending on the size of the dataset, it might be necessary to compress the data to reduce memory consumption and improve computational efficiency. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can help achieve dimensionality reduction without losing significant information.

4. Data Augmentation: For image datasets, augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, etc., can artificially increase the size of the dataset and introduce more variability, thereby improving the robustness of the trained model.

These preprocessing steps aim to enhance the overall performance of the deep learning model by ensuring that the input data is clean, consistent, and suitable for the chosen algorithm. However, the exact set of preprocessing steps required would vary depending on the nature and complexity of the dataset, as well as the specific requirements of the deep learning task at hand.
