The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, one might use various metrics such as validation loss plateau, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc., depending on the nature of the problem and the chosen model. It is important to note that the choice of metric should align with the goals of the project and the desired outcomes. Without more information about the specific models being trained and their objectives, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
