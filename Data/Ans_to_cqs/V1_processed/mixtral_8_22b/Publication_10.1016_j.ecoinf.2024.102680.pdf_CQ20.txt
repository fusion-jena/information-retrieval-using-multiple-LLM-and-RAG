The experimental environment used for training the deep learning model includes an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, a 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700F 2.10 GHz CPU, and 64 GB of random access memory. The training acceleration was performed using CUDA 11.8. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is primarily the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU.
