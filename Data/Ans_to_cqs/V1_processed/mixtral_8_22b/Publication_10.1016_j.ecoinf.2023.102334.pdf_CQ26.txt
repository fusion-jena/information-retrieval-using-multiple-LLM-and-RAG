The given context does not provide specific details about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, there are several techniques used to mitigate data bias:

1. Stratified Splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. It ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of each class.

2. Oversampling: This method increases the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or creating synthetic ones. It helps balance the dataset when dealing with imbalanced classes.

3. Undersampling: Contrary to oversampling, this technique reduces the number of instances in the majority class to achieve a balanced dataset. It may involve removing random samples or selecting those that contribute most to the model's performance.

4. Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse data from various sources can help reduce bias introduced by limited or skewed data. This includes gathering data from different geographical locations, demographics, or time periods.

These techniques aim to improve the fairness and robustness of deep learning models by reducing biases present in the input data.
