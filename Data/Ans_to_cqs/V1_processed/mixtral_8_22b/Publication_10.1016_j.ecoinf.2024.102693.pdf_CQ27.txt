Based on the given context, it appears that the text does not provide specific details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer regarding the exact steps taken for model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, typically, after training a deep learning model, the next step involves saving or serializing the model weights and architecture into a file format like.h5,.onnx, or.pb. This serialized model can later be loaded and used for prediction or further analysis. As for platform selection, depending on the use case, these models could be deployed on various platforms, including cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or edge devices like Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson. But without explicit information from the provided context, I cannot confirm the specific methodology employed in this scenario.
