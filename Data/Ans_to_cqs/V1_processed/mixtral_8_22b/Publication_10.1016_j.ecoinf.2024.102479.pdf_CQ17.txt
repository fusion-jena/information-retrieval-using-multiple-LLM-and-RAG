Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning pipelines. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which can lead to poor generalization to new data. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are Lasso Regression and Dropout.

Lasso Regression, also known as L1 Regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function during optimization. This penalty term is proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging smaller weight values and thus simpler models. By shrinking some coefficients to zero, Lasso Regression performs feature selection, making it useful for high dimensional datasets.

Dropout is another popular regularization method used primarily in deep learning architectures like artificial neural networks. Dropout randomly deactivates a certain percentage of neurons during training, forcing the network to distribute the learned information across all available neurons rather than relying heavily on specific ones. This helps reduce overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization) and Early Stopping. Ridge Regression adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the weights, promoting small but nonzero weights. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error during training and halting the process once the error starts increasing, preventing further overfitting.
