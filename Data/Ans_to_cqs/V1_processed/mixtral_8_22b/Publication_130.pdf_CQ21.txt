After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken to evaluate the performance of the trained model. These may include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to measure how well the model has learned to classify the input data. Another common step is to create confusion matrices, which provide a visual representation of the correct and incorrect predictions made by the model. Additionally, saliency maps can also be generated to highlight the most relevant parts of the input data that contributed to the final prediction. In the given context, no specific postprocessing steps are mentioned; however, based on general practices, these steps would likely be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the trained model.
