Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be applied to improve its performance. These include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the data into a standard format, often by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Scaling refers to adjusting the range of features to ensure they contribute equally during training. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any inconsistencies or errors in the data.

In the given context, it is mentioned that the input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaling them between 0 and 1. Mean centering is a form of normalization where the average value of the pixel intensities is subtracted from each pixel intensity. Rescaling is a type of scaling where the pixel intensities are adjusted to fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. Additionally, various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shifts, flips, zooms, and brightness changes were also applied. Data augmentation is not strictly a preprocessing step but rather a technique used to increase the amount of available training data and reduce overfitting.
