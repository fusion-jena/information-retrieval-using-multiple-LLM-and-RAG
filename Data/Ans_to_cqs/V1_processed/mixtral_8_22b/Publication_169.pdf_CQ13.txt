The experimental setup mentions that the model parameters were optimized using the gradient descent Adam algorithm with all parameters set to their default values. However, the specific hyperparameters such as the learning rate or other settings for the Adam optimizer are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot provide the exact hyperparameters used in this deep learning model.
