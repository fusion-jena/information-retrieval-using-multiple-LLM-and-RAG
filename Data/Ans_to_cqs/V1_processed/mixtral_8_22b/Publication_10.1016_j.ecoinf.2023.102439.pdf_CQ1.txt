In the given context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the study uses satellite data from the MODIS-TERRA sensor to derive the LST dataset. Specifically, the data is obtained from the MOD11A2 product, which offers 8-day temporal and 1 km spatial resolutions covering 2005-2018. Additionally, the study mentions using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS NDBI data from 2014 to 2018. Therefore, it can be concluded that the study primarily utilizes remote sensing data collected through satellites as its primary source of raw data.
