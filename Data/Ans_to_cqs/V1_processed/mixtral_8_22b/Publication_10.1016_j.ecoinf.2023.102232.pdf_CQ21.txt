Based on the given context, it appears that the text discusses a hybrid MCMC algorithm used for modeling purposes rather than machine learning or deep learning models. Therefore, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix do not directly apply to this scenario. However, I will provide information about the postprocessing steps involved in the hybrid MCMC algorithm discussed in the context.

In the hybrid MCMC algorithm, there are two primary steps involved in the postprocessing phase. After obtaining the optimal combination of parameters using the least squares approach, the next step involves sampling the a posteriori distribution of parameters using a Metropolis-Hastings-like algorithm.

Once the algorithm has been executed, the resulting outputs include the following:

1. Best parameter values: The algorithm selects a random row from the genetic algorithm output database and absorbs the best parameter values. These values are assumed to be the mean of a Gaussian distribution, denoted as μ, with an associated variance defined as a fixed value σ^2 = (0.2 μ)^2.

2. Random value generation: For each parameter, a random value is generated from the Gaussian distribution using the random.normal() function. Subsequently, the ODE system is solved.

3. Comparison with experimental data: The algorithm allows for comparing the ODE model output with the experimental data based on the log-probability value.

4. Ordering of database entries: The entries of the database are ordered from smaller to higher sum of residual values.

5. Generation of a posteriori distribution: Finally, the a posteriori distribution of the parameters is generated by merging all the traces of each correct simulation into a single database. The statistical distribution of the parameters is reported by its mean and the standard deviation of the traces of the database of MCMC simulations.
