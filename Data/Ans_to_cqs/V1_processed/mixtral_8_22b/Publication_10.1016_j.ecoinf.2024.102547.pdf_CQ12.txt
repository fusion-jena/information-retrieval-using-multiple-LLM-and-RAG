The information provided does not mention the use of any specific deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, it discusses the application of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Functional Geostatistical Spatio-Temporal Additive Models (FGSAMs). These are statistical models used for analyzing complex relationships between variables, including spatial and temporal dependencies. Therefore, based on the given context, no specific deep learning model can be identified as being used in the pipeline.
