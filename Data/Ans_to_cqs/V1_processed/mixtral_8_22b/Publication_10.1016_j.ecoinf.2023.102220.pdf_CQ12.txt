The text mentions that the authors used a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture with ReLU activation functions for the hidden layers and a sigmoid activation function for the output layer. Additionally, they incorporated a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) block into their DNN architecture. Therefore, the deep learning model used in the pipeline can be classified as a combination of a feedforward neural network (DNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM cells. This hybrid model takes advantage of both architectures, allowing it to learn complex representations from input features (using the DNN component) and capture temporal dependencies within sequential data (through the LSTM component).
