The given context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. The context only mentions that the weights were obtained from an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact hyperparameters used in the model based on the provided context.
