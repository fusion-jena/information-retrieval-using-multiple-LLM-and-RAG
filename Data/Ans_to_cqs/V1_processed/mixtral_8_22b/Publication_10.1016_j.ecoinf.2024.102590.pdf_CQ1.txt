In the given context, the authors utilize a specific methodology for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. They do not use traditional methods like surveys or sensors but rather employ a guided approach based on existing knowledge of vegetation types. Specifically, they create several small sampling plots within each vegetation type, as opposed to using one large area. This is done to ensure that the training and validation points collected are representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary.

To determine the size of these sampling plots, they calculate 5% of the total area covered by the boundary and divide it by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary. Furthermore, if a vegetation type is too small to accommodate the entire sampling plot, they place the largest area within that vegetation type while assigning the remaining area to the nearest largest vegetation type.

Therefore, in summary, the authors collect raw data for their deep learning pipeline through the creation of multiple small sampling plots within each vegetation type, ensuring representation of diverse vegetation. The size of these plots is determined by calculating a certain percentage of the total area and dividing it by the number of intersecting vegetation types. In cases where a vegetation type is too small, adjustments are made accordingly.
