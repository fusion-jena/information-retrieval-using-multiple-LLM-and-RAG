Based on the information provided, it appears that the study utilizes four methods to model forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB): AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes). Among these, only one method can be classified as a deep learning model - the multilayer neural network (NET). However, the specific architecture or type of this neural network is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, we cannot determine if it is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of neural network.
