The given context does not provide information regarding the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring that each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the representation of minority classes by duplicating samples, while undersampling reduces the majority class representation. Lastly, diverse data collection aims to gather more representative data to reduce biases inherent in the initial dataset.
