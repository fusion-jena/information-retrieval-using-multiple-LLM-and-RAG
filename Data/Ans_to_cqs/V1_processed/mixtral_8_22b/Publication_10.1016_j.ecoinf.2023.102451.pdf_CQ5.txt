The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the Environmental Microorganism Dataset - 6 (EMDS-6). This dataset is publicly available and consists of 840 different images of environmental microorganisms, divided into 21 categories with 40 images for each category. The proposed architecture was tested on this dataset and achieved prominent results compared to other deep learning models. It also performed well with an augmented set of EMDS-6 datasets.
