Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalization capabilities of the model.
