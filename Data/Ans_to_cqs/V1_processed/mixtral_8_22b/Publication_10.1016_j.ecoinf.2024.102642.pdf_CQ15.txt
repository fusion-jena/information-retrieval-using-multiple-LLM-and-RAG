The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. However, it discusses various aspects related to improving the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models.

The text mentions leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies. It further explores distinctive annotation profiles influenced by the complexity of vocalizations and the annotators' strategies, ranging from conservative to permissive.

To handle annotation discrepancies, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained on annotations from both novices and experts. The results indicate variations in model performance. Two annotation aggregation methods – majority voting and soft labeling – are proposed and tested to optimize the potential of multi-annotation and mitigate the presence of noisy labels. Both methods, especially when a sufficient number of annotators are involved, significantly improve model performance and reduce variability.

The conclusion states that evaluating the performance of CNNs trained on different annotation sets involves using datasets containing other SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale’s Dcalls. However, only a small portion of these datasets is utilized due to computational constraints.

While the context provides valuable insights into addressing challenges in cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models, it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques like SGD or Adam employed within the deep learning pipeline.
