The text does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it mentions that a data augmentation procedure was employed to artificially increase the sample size by applying transformations to an existing set of images. Data augmentation techniques typically involve creating modified versions of the original images through various transformations, including but not limited to flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and adjusting brightness or contrast. These techniques help improve the generalization capabilities of deep learning models by exposing them to diverse variations of input data during training.
