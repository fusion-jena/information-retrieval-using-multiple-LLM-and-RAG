The text does not provide explicit information about the specific purpose of a deep learning model used in this study. However, it mentions several algorithms and models used for atmospheric correction (AC) in various aquatic environments, such as the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model and algorithms based on the single scattering approximation. These methods are employed to improve the quality of remote sensing data obtained from sensors like Sentinel-2, SPOT-6, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2.

Additionally, there is mention of a paper titled "A comparative evaluation of deep convolutional neural network and deep neural network-based land use/land cover classifications of mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data" (Kumar & Gorai, 2023), which suggests that deep learning models may be used for land use/land cover classification purposes. However, without more context or direct reference to a specific deep learning model within this research, we cannot definitively state its purpose.
