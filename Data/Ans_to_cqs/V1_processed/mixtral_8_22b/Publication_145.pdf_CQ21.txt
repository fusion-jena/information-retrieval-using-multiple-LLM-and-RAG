After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrix generation.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of input data that have the most significant impact on the output prediction. They help identify which parts of the input data contribute more towards the final decision made by the model. This is particularly useful when working with complex datasets such as satellite imagery where it may not always be clear what features the model is focusing on.

Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the model based on various statistical measures like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics provide insights into how well the model has learned from the training data and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Confusion matrices are another popular way of assessing the performance of classification models. A confusion matrix is essentially a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model against actual values. It provides detailed information about true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, allowing us to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model better.

In this study, the authors do not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps they followed after training their deep learning model. However, given the nature of the problem being addressed - semantic segmentation of deforestation areas in satellite imagery - one could infer that some form of evaluation metric would have been employed to measure the effectiveness of the model. Additionally, since the paper discusses generating masks for different classes (forest, non-forest natural formation, agriculture or pasture, water bodies), it is likely that techniques like saliency mapping were utilized to gain further insight into the model's behavior.
