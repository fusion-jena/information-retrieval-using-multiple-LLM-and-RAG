The text does not explicitly mention any well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it refers to two specific datasets used in this study: the Bactrocera cucurbitae pest dataset and the Pest_24_640 dataset. These datasets seem to be custom datasets created specifically for this research, focusing on pest detection tasks.
