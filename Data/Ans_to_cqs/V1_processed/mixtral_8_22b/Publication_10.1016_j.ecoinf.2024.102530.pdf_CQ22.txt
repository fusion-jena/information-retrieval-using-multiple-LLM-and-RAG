The text does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of a cross-comparison based on the ApisFis model and validation data, which suggests that the model's predictions are being compared to actual field data. This could imply the use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or others commonly used in machine learning to measure the performance of a model against ground truth data. Unfortunately, without further context or explicit mention of the metrics used, it is impossible to definitively state what metrics are being employed in this case.
