The information provided does not explicitly state the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on the tables presented, it appears that the researchers conducted various experiments with different training and testing datasets for upper-, left-, and right-pose models. They also evaluated their models using precision measures such as P1, P3, P5, and P6. These metrics could have been used to track the progress and performance of the models during training. Additionally, they mentioned performing initial experiments to evaluate different aspects and approaches to tackle the problem, which suggests that monitoring the model performance was part of their experimental process.
