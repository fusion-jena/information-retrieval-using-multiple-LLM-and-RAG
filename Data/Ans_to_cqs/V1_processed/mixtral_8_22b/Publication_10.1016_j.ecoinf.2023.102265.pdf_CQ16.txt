The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the training and validation of the classifier were done using 5-fold cross-validation. This method involves splitting the dataset into five equal parts or folds. Four of these folds are used for training, while the remaining fold is used for validation. This process is repeated five times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. It also allows for a more robust estimation of the model's performance. In this case, the use of 5-fold cross-validation suggests that the training might be considered complete after all five iterations have been performed. Additionally, the mention of validation accuracy in relation to choosing ResNet-50 implies that the model's ability to accurately predict outcomes on the validation set could also play a role in determining when training is complete. However, without further information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
