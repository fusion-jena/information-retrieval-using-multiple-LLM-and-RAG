The text does not explicitly state how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it mentions that preliminary sensitivity tests were conducted to identify critical parameters, specifically Max Segments (MS) and Recovery Threshold (RT), which were then selected for further evaluation. This suggests that some form of optimization was performed on these parameters, but the exact method used is not specified in the provided context.
