The text does not provide explicit details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer some possible steps. After training the model, it would typically be serialized into a format suitable for storage or transfer, such as a.pkl file in Python's pickle module or a.h5 file in Keras. This serialized model can then be loaded onto a platform for use. The choice of platform depends on various factors like computational resources, accessibility, and intended application. It could range from a local device to cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Unfortunately, without further context, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact process followed in this particular case.
