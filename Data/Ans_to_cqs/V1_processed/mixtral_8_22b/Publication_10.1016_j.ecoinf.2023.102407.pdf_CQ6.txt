The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does indicate that ecological studies often use preprocessed environmental data at meter- or kilometer-level resolution to effectively model potential species distributions at broad scales. This suggests that some form of preprocessing might occur to transform raw environmental data into a more suitable format for modeling purposes. Additionally, the text mentions that a maximum of 10,000 unlabeled data points are randomly sampled from DU without replacement and pseudo-labels are generated for these data points. This could imply that there might be some initial filtering or selection process to ensure the quality and relevance of the chosen data points for generating accurate pseudo-labels.
