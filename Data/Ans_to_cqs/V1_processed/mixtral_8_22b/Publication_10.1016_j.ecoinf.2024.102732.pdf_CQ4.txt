The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, generally speaking, data augmentation techniques are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data available by applying random transformations to existing images. These techniques can include flipping (horizontal or vertical), rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, translating, and adding noise. Each transformation helps improve the robustness and generalizability of the trained models.
