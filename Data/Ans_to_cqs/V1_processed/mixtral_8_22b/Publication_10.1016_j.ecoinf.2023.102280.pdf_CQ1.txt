The text does not explicitly mention specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it implies that clean data is collected and noise profiles are superimposed to create both input data and a 'denoised' ground truth. It suggests that collecting clean recordings might be infeasible in many cases or could involve recording captive animals, which may not represent the broader population. In adjacent fields, human speech or music can be generated as needed, but this isn't always possible for bioacoustics applications. Additionally, the creation of large-scale datasets is deemed impractical due to the sparsity of vocalizations in these applications. Therefore, while no explicit method is mentioned, we can infer that data collection involves gathering clean recordings and adding noise profiles to them.
