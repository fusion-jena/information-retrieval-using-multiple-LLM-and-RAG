Based on the given context, it appears that no specific type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers has been explicitly mentioned in the pipeline. Instead, the focus seems to be on species distribution modeling, which involves techniques like Maxent, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These methods are commonly used in ecological studies rather than deep learning architectures. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot definitively state what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
