The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that a pre-trained model was used for feature extraction from the fixed inception layers, which took approximately 1 hour and 26 minutes on 15 CPUs. Afterward, training of the new layers was performed on a single CPU and took around 27 minutes. Additionally, model evaluation was conducted on 70 test videos using 30 CPUs, taking about 4 hours and 38 minutes with an average frame rate of 17 frames per second. It also mentions that the fine-tuned neural network was trained with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot determine the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
