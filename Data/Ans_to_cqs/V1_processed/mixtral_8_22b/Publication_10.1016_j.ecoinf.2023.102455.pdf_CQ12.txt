In this pipeline, a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) is used for creating the primary model, referred to as CNN-BiGRU. This model is compared with other Machine Learning (ML) methods such as Kernel Extreme Learning Machines (KELM), Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL), and another variant of the CNN model combined with Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-BiRNN). These comparisons result in four complementary models: MVMD-CNN-BiGRU, MVMD-RVFL, MVMD-KELM, and MVMD-CNN-BiRNN. Therefore, the types of deep learning models employed in this pipeline include CNN and GRU (a variant of RNN).
