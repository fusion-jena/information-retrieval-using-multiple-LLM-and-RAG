Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the given context to determine what specific optimization techniques have been used in their deep learning pipeline. However, some common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. Without further details about the methods or references mentioned in the paper, it would not be possible to provide a more precise answer.
