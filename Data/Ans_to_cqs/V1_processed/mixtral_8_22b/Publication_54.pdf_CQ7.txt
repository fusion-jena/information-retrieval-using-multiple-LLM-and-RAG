In the given context, the data is split into three parts for deep learning model training: training, testing, and validation. The criterion used to split the data is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred from the information provided.

For the training set, 3,132 images of endemic birds are used. This set is further augmented 10 times to create a total of 31,320 images. Out of these, 25,056 (80%) images are used for training, and the rest 6,264 (20%) are used for validation. It seems that the authors have chosen an 80/20 split ratio for their training and validation sets.

For the testing set, 760 images of endemic birds are used. These images are kept separate from the training and validation sets to evaluate the performance of the model after it has been trained.

It should also be noted that the authors mention using k-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. However, they do not specify how many folds they use or whether they apply this technique to all three sets (train, test, and validation). Therefore, based on the available information, it cannot be determined whether k-fold cross-validation is used to split the data or only applied during the training phase.
