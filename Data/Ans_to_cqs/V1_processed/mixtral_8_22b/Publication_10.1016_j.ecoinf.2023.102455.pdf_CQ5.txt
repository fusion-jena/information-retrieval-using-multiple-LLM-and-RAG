Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine what specific datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline. The provided context only discusses various aspects of a CNN-BiGRU model, such as its layers, filters, optimizers, activation functions, epochs, batch sizes, learning rates, dense layers, number of nodes, regularization coefficients, weight random ranges, bias random ranges, and kernel parameters. However, there is no mention of any specific dataset being used for training or testing this model. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
