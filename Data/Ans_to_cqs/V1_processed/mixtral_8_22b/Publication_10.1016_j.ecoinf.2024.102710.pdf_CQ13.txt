Unfortunately, the given context does not contain information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It primarily discusses various embedding models, sampling strategies, and the results obtained using these models and strategies. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested details regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
