The clustering performance of the deep learning model, specifically the dynamic Î²-VAE, is evaluated using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) scores. These metrics are used to measure the intra-class cohesion and inter-class separability of the model. However, there is no explicit mention of other common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall in this context.
