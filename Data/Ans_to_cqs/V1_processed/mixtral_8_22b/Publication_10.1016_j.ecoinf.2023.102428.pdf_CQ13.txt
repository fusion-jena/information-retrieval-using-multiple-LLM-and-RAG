The table titled 'MLP Parameters and Performance' provides information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Here are some of them:

* Input layer neurons: 8
* Hidden layer nodes: 10
* Output layer neurons: 8
* Requested samples per class: 1688
* Start learning rate: 0.0008
* End learning rate: 0.0001
* Momentum factor: 0.5
* Sigmoid constant: 1.0
* Iterations: 10,000
* Acceptable RMS: 0.01

These hyperparameters were used in the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network - Markov Chain (MLPnn-MC) modeling approach, which combines the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain. This model uses deep machine learning to learn the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, multivariate, and non-linear relationships. It creates several transitions and predicts unseen data within the model at a single time by understanding the hidden relationships.
