The given context does not provide explicit details about the specific datasets used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that they leverage advances in big data and deep learning to process and analyze wildlife data streams. This suggests that they might be using custom datasets tailored to their specific application, which could include images, audio recordings, or other types of sensor data collected for wildlife monitoring purposes. They also mention having access to large amounts of labeled data produced by analysts using their user interface. Unfortunately, without further context, I cannot provide the exact names of the datasets used in their deep learning pipeline.
