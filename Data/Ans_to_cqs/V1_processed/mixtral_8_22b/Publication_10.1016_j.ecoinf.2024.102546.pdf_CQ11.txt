The paper does not provide information about the specific data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact link to resources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, the authors do mention using various datasets, including the DeepWeeds dataset, which can be found in the cited reference by Olsen et al. (2019). Additionally, they use other sources like the work by Rahman et al. (2022) and Rai et al. (not explicitly mentioned but referenced in the text). Unfortunately, without more specific details, it is impossible to pinpoint the precise data repositories utilized in this study.
