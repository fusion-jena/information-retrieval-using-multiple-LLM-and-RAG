The study examines the use of machine learning (ML) bounding box models to assist in the data labelling process, specifically for tagging wildlife in trail camera imagery. This suggests that one of the data annotation techniques used in this deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around an object in an image to identify its location and size. In this case, it is used to accurately crop images of wildlife for training classification models. The study also mentions the need for manual validation of these bounding boxes, indicating that human input is still required in the annotation process. It does not mention any other specific data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation.
