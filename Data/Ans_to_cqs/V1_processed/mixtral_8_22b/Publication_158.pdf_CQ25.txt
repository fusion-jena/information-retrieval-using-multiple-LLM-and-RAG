The primary purpose of the deep learning model discussed in this context is for classification tasks. This is evident from the mention of a deep-learning classifier being employed alongside other methods such as random forests. Furthermore, the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as depicted in Figure 3, supports this claim since CNNs are commonly utilized for image classification tasks. Additionally, the text mentions evaluating the classification results against a test sample and reporting various metrics like error matrices, summary accuracy measures, and class accuracies. These practices are typically associated with assessing the performance of a classification model. While segmentation-based approaches were considered initially, they were not pursued due to insufficient quality training data for segmentation. Therefore, the main objective of the deep learning model in this scenario is to accurately classify images into their respective categories.
