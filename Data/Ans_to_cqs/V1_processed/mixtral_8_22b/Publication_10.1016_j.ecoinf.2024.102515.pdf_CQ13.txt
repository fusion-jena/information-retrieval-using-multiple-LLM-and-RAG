Unfortunately, based on the given context, I am unable to provide the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The context does not mention any details regarding the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, etc. It primarily focuses on the challenges faced while collecting data from Twitter and the methods used to extract relevant biodiversity observations.
