The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data in jpeg format. This includes trap image files and insect images extracted from these trap images based on bounding box coordinates and annotations. Additionally, the pipeline utilizes CSV files containing bounding box information, such as coordinates and species labels. While there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio or video, the focus appears to be on visual data for insect identification and classification.
