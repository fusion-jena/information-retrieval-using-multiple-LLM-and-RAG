Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention or discussion about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific strategy related to this topic based solely on the provided text. However, common practices in dealing with randomness in deep learning include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, employing techniques like cross-validation, and utilizing ensemble methods to reduce variance caused by random initialization.
