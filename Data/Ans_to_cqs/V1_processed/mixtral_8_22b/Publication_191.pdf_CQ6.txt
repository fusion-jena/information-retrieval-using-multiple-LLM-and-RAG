The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps used before training the deep learning model. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some typical preprocessing steps include image resizing, normalization, augmentation, and label encoding. Image resizing ensures that all input images have consistent dimensions. Normalization scales pixel values between 0 and 1 or centers them around zero mean and unit variance, helping the model converge faster during training. Augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and cropping create additional training samples and improve the model's robustness against various transformations. Label encoding involves converting categorical labels into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. These preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the requirements of the chosen deep learning architecture.
