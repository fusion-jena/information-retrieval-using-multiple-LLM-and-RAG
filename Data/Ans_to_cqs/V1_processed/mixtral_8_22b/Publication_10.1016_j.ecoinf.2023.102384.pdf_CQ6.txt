The text does not provide explicit information regarding general preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it mentions several preprocessing steps specific to generating ground truth data for training deep learning models. These include generating bounding boxes, density maps, and segmentation maps from dot labels. Bounding boxes are created by centering squares over the dots with a fixed side length's'. Density maps are produced by overlaying Gaussian kernels centered at the dot positions, while segmentation maps are generated by superimposing dot-centered discs with radius 'r', splitting overlapping discs using a background ridge. Parameters's', 'Ïƒ', and 'r' are constants determined based on typical object sizes prevalent in the images. Additionally, the text describes dividing images into smaller patches during both training and validation stages. During training, random cropping of square patches of varying sizes is performed along with simple augmentation strategies like horizontal and vertical flipping with a 50% probability. During validation, images are divided into regularly spaced, overlapping patches of the same size used in training. These patches are processed individually, and their outputs combined to form the overall prediction.
