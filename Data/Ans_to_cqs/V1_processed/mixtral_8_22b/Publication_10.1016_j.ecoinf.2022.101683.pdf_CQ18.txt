The text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred from the given context that the Area Under Curve (AUC), True Positive Rate (TPR), Cohen's kappa coefficient (Kappa), and True Skill Statistic (TSS) were used as evaluation metrics for assessing the model performance. These metrics are commonly employed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a binary classifier system. Additionally, the threshold used for these evaluations was the 10th percentile training presence. This suggests that the model performance might have been monitored by comparing its predictions against the actual values using these metrics during the training phase.
