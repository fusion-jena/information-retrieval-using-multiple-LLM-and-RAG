Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the amount of training data and improve the model's ability to generalize by introducing variations into the input data. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem and the type of data being used. In the case of hyperspectral data for water quality prediction, appropriate data augmentation techniques would need to be carefully selected to ensure meaningful transformations that do not distort the underlying patterns in the data.
