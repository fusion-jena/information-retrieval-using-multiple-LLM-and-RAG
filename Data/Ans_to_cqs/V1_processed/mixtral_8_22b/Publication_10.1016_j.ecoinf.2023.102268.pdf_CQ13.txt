Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer employed. However, it does mention that a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier with a cubic polynomial kernel was used as the final classification model. Additionally, it states that a 10-fold cross-validation was utilized to determine the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. These details suggest that some form of tuning or optimization may have taken place, but without explicit mention of the hyperparameters used, we cannot definitively state what they were.
