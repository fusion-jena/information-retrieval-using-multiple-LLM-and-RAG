The given context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses how workflows can help compensate for some biases through data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation, especially when dealing with large input datasets. This suggests that proper organization and management of data can contribute to reducing bias. Additionally, the text mentions that the precision of the workflow's output depends on factors like the completeness of input vessel data, the update rate of the Global Record of Stocks and Fisheries (GRSF), and the completeness of Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) data in the selected time range. Therefore, ensuring high-quality and complete data inputs could also indirectly mitigate potential biases.
