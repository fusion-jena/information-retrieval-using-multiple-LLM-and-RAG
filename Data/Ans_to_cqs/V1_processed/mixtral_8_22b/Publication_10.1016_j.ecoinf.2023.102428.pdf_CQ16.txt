The table titled "Table 7 - MLP parameters and performance" provides information about the parameters and performance of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. Among these parameters, there are two relevant ones for determining when training is complete: "Iterations" and "Acceptable RMS."

The "Iterations" parameter indicates the maximum number of times the algorithm will iterate through the entire dataset during training. In this case, it is set to 10,000 iterations. This means that if the algorithm does not converge or meet any other stopping criterion before reaching 10,000 iterations, the training process will stop after completing the specified number of iterations.

The second relevant parameter is "Acceptable RMS," which stands for Root Mean Square error. It represents the acceptable level of error between the predicted values and actual values. In this case, the value is set to 0.01. During training, the algorithm continuously calculates the RMS error between its predictions and the actual values. When the calculated RMS error falls below the "Acceptable RMS" threshold, the training can be considered complete.

In summary, based on the given context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete for this specific MLP model are either reaching the maximum number of iterations (10,000) or achieving an acceptable RMS error lower than 0.01.
