The context provided does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in machine learning, some possible criteria include reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set (such as a minimum validation loss), or observing no further improvement in validation loss over several epochs (also known as a validation loss plateau). In this case, it appears that cross-validation was used to optimize the parameters of the model, but there is no explicit mention of how many epochs were trained or what specific stopping criterion was used. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot definitively answer the query.
