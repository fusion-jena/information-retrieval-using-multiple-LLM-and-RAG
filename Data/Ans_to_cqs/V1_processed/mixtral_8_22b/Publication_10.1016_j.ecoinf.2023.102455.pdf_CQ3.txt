Unfortunately, there isn't any information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, it's not possible to provide an accurate response based solely on this information. However, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. Each technique serves different purposes depending on the specific application or use case. For example, bounding boxes are often used for object detection tasks, while semantic segmentation can be employed for image classification problems. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation, allowing individual objects within an image to be identified and classified separately. Polygon annotation is useful when dealing with irregular shapes or outlines, whereas key point annotations help identify specific points of interest within images. Landmark annotation focuses on facial features recognition.
