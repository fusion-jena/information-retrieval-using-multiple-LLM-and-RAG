The pipeline uses a deep learning model known as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it employs the GoogLeNet architecture, which consists of 27 layers, including 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. The inception layers, inspired by the GoogLeNet design, help reduce the dimensions of images while minimizing the impact of dimensional changes. Additionally, the network has been fine-tuned by adjusting certain parameters such as stride sizes and initial convolution settings tailored to the specific application requirements.
