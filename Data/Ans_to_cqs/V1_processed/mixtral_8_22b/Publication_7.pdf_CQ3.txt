The authors do not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they do refer to using expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from the Benthoz15 dataset [23] for fine-tuning the weights of a pre-trained VGGnet [24]. This suggests that some form of supervised learning is being applied, where the ground truth labels or annotations are likely provided by human experts. Without further information, it cannot be determined whether these annotations involve bounding boxes, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, or other forms of labeling.
