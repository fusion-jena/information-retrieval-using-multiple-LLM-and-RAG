Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to ensure optimal performance. These may include data cleaning, where missing or irrelevant values are removed from the dataset. Normalization or standardization can also be performed to rescale features so they have similar magnitudes, improving convergence during optimization. Scaling techniques like min-max scaling or z-score normalization can help achieve this. Additionally, feature engineering might involve creating new features from existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. Lastly, splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets allows for proper model evaluation and tuning. In the given context, no specific preprocessing steps are mentioned for the artificial neural network model. However, these general practices could apply depending on the nature of the input data.
