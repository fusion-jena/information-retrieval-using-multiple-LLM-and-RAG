Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that the process involves both automated computer vision methods and manual human review.

In the context, it mentions the use of MegaDetector which is likely a computer vision tool used for object detection in images. It also refers to manual classification and custom-trained models, suggesting that some level of manual data annotation was involved.

However, without more detailed information about these processes, it cannot be definitively stated what specific data annotation techniques were used. Therefore, based solely on this context, it is not possible to provide a precise answer to the query.
