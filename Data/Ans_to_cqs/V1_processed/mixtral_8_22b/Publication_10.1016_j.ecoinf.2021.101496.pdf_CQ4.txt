The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in machine learning and computer vision tasks to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to existing images, thereby improving the generalization ability of models. However, without explicit information about the application of these techniques in this case, it cannot be confirmed which ones have been utilized.
