The given context does not provide specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It mentions using a TPINet-based process network approach and considering a maximum memory duration of the variables up to 6 hours to focus on sub-daily scale processes. However, it does not discuss any optimization techniques like grid search or random search for tuning the hyperparameters of the model. Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
