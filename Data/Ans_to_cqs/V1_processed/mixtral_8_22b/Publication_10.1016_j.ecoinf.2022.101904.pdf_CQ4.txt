The paper does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of synthetic data with the Swin Transformer, which could imply some form of data augmentation. Additionally, the table shows results from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) combined with the Swin Transformer, suggesting that this might also involve some kind of data generation or augmentation technique. Unfortunately, without more detailed information about these methods, I cannot provide a definitive list of the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
