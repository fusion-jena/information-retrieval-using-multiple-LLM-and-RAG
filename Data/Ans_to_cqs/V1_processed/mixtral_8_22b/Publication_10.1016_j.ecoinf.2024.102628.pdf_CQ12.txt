In the given context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned by name. However, it can be inferred that a variant of the Residual Network (ResNet) family, specifically ResNet-34, is being used. ResNet-34 is a 34-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is widely used for deep learning tasks, particularly in computer vision. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
