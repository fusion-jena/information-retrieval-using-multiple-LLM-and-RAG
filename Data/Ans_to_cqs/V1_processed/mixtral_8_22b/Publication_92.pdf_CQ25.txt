The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it is used for classification tasks. The text mentions that since the 2012 ImageNet competition, neural networks have become a strong possibility for classification tasks due to advancements in computational power through GPUs. It also states that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are capable of creating feature vectors and classifying them. Furthermore, the architecture of the network follows GoogleNet's design, which includes a soft-max classifier, indicating that the model is being used for multi-class classification. However, without explicit confirmation, it cannot be definitively said that the sole purpose of the deep learning model is for classification.
