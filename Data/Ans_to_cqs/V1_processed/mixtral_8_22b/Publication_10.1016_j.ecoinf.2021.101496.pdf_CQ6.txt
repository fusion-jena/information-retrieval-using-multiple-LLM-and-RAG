Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These include:

Normalization: This involves rescaling the values of features so they fall within a specified range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Normalizing the data helps prevent certain features from dominating others simply because they have larger numeric values.

Scaling: Scaling is similar to normalization but instead of rescaling the feature values to a fixed range, it scales them to have zero mean and unit variance. This is particularly useful when using algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) which perform poorly if the scale of features varies significantly.

Cleaning: Data cleaning involves removing noise and inconsistencies from the dataset. This might involve handling missing values, correcting errors, dealing with outliers, etc. Cleaning ensures that the model learns from accurate and consistent data.

In the given context, all predictors were scaled prior to analysis for the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This suggests that scaling was employed as a preprocessing step before training the deep learning model.
