The given context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, some possible data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within images or videos. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label, while instance segmentation involves identifying individual instances of objects within an image. Other techniques may also be used depending on the specific application and requirements of the project.

Based on the given context, it appears that the authors plan to use deep learning models such as CNN and RCNN for landslide susceptibility mapping. These models typically require large amounts of labeled training data, so it is likely that one or more of these annotation techniques were used to prepare the dataset for this study. However, without further information about the specific methods used by the authors, it is impossible to determine exactly which annotation techniques were employed.
