The text does not provide explicit information about the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the ResNet-50 model was pre-trained with the ImageNet database. Additionally, the study involves gathering standard visual information and low-level image features from datasets containing color, texture, shape, etc. But no specific names of datasets are mentioned apart from ImageNet.

Based on the given context, one cannot definitively state which other datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline besides ImageNet.
