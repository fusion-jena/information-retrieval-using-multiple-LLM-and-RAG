The paper does not provide specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that the dataset used in this study consists of 10,000 images collected from various sources, including YouTube videos, online databases, and field surveys. However, there is no mention of any public repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the dataset has been made available. Therefore, it is unclear if the dataset is publicly accessible or not.
