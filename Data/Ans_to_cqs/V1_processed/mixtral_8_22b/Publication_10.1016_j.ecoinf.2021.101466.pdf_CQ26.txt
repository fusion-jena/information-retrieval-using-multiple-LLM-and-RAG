The text does not provide explicit information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of data augmentation techniques like cropping, flipping, scaling, rotating, adding noise, and color transformation to prepare 4000 images for each category while training the EfficientNet. Additionally, random erasing is applied to the training dataset to improve performance further. These techniques can help mitigate data bias by creating diverse datasets and reducing overfitting. Nevertheless, other common techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, but these are not mentioned explicitly in the given context.
