The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it mentions that a deep learning algorithm called the multilayer perceptron (MLP) was employed for SOCS modeling. While this information doesn't directly indicate the use of popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, these frameworks do support building models with MLP architectures. Therefore, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another similar framework could have been utilized to construct the MLP model. Additionally, the reference section includes a citation for TensorFlow, but it remains unclear if TensorFlow was specifically used for this particular study.
