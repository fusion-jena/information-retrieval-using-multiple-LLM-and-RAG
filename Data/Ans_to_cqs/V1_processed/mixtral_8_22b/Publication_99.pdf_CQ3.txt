The given context does not provide information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of data annotation must have taken place since the paper discusses the use of deep learning techniques for reconstructing damaged herbarium leaves and classifying plant species. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Without further context or details, it is impossible to determine which specific technique was employed in this study.
