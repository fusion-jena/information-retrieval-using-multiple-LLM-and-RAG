The context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, generally, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. Common methods for splitting datasets include random sampling, stratified sampling, and time series split.

Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is on discussing the application of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles in managing and sharing ecological samples and their derived data. This includes creating metadata that clearly describes the data, registering or indexing the metadata in a searchable resource, using standardized communication protocols, and adhering to existing standards such as INSPIRE, O&M, and Darwin Core. While these practices contribute to making data more usable and interchangeable across different platforms and systems, they do not directly address the specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training.
