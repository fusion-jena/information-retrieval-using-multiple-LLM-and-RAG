The papers mentioned in the context discuss various applications of deep learning models in different fields such as agriculture, ecology, and materials science. However, not all of these papers explicitly state the purpose of their deep learning models. Nevertheless, we can infer the purposes of some of these models based on the tasks they perform.

For instance, Olatunji (2019) uses neural networks and support vector machines for predicting chronic kidney disease, suggesting that the purpose of their deep learning model is classification. Similarly, Aryal (2020) performs glacier segmentation in satellite images, indicating that the purpose of their deep learning model is semantic segmentation.

On the other hand, Ayadi et al. (2022) conduct a survey of resolution methods for constraint satisfaction problems in remote sensing, but it does not appear that they use any specific deep learning model. Instead, they focus on discussing various algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction problems.

Similarly, Bazzi et al. (2019) map paddy rice using Sentinel-1 SAR time series, while Bioresita et al. (2018) propose a method for automatic and rapid mapping of water surfaces from Sentinel-1 imagery. These papers do not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models, so it is unclear what the purpose of any potential deep learning models would be.

Finally, Gola et al. (2019) use a support vector machine for objective microstructure classification in low carbon steels. This suggests that the purpose of their deep learning model is also classification.

Overall, the papers discussed here use deep learning models for various purposes, including classification, semantic segmentation, and potentially others. However, not all of the papers explicitly state the purpose of their deep learning models or even use deep learning models at all.
