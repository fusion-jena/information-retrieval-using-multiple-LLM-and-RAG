The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the YOLOv8 algorithm. This algorithm is known for object detection tasks and provides various network structures like YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l, and YOLOv8x. These structures differ in width and depth but share the same principles. For instance, YOLOv8n was selected as the base structure to emphasize speed without compromising accuracy. Furthermore, modifications were made to the C2f layer, which plays a significant role in the overall architecture of YOLOv8. This modified layer is referred to as C2f2.
