The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a combination of active learning sample selection strategies. These strategies include uncertainty and diversity based methods, myopic (greedy) and adaptive (batch mode) methods. The experiment uses BirdNet-1 as the embedding model, which has been found to yield the best performance as a feature embedding model for both the target modality and the domain.

In terms of monitoring the model performance, the approach involves selecting 5% of the samples randomly initially. Then, incremental labeling is done for each batch of samples queried by the sampling methods. This allows for tracking the progress of the model's learning curve over time. The classifier heads used in this process are identical to those from the transfer learning training process.

It should be noted that the validation set used in this study is relatively small compared to other studies. However, the focus here is on evaluating the effectiveness of different active learning strategies rather than direct comparison with other models. Therefore, while the specific metrics used to measure model performance are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that they involve assessing the rate of convergence and accuracy of the model given the limited amount of labeled data.
