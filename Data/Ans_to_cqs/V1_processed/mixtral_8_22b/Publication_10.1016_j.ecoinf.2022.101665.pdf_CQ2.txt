The text does not provide explicit information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Earth observation imagery, climatic data, and terrain variables derived from digital elevation models as predictors. This suggests that the data formats used could include images (for Earth observation imagery) and possibly CSV or other tabular formats for climatic data and terrain variables. Without more specific details, it is difficult to determine the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
