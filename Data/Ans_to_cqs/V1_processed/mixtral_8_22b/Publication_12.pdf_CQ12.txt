The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model named BatNet. This is evident from the statement mentioning the addition of Batch Normalization (BNorm) layers behind the 22 convolutional layers in BatNet. Furthermore, the comparison between BatNet and other three networks also suggests that BatNet is a CNN model.
