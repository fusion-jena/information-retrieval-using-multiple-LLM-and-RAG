The text mentions that a deep learning approach was used, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN). This was employed to create a high-resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the Earth, referred to as Lang10m, at a 10-meter resolution. The CNN was utilized in conjunction with Sentinel-2 optical images.
