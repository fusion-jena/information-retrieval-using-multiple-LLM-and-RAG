Based on the provided context, there isn't any direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general strategies can be suggested:

1. Fixed Random Seed: One common strategy is to fix the random seed value before running experiments or training models. By doing so, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated every time the code runs, ensuring reproducibility.

2. Multiple Runs: Another way to manage randomness is to run multiple iterations of the experiment or training process with different random seeds. This helps capture the variability introduced by random initialization and provides more robust performance estimates.

3. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can help reduce the impact of randomness by averaging out the performance across different subsets of the dataset.

4. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models trained with different random initializations can also improve overall performance and mitigate the effects of randomness. Techniques like bagging and boosting fall under this category.

While these strategies are generally applicable, specific approaches may vary depending on the problem domain and available resources.
