The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets such as train, test, or validation. However, it can be inferred that the study uses a hierarchical structure to select the optimal feature combination from the training samples. This suggests that the dataset might have been divided into training and testing datasets, with the training set being further segmented into multiple levels based on their hierarchy.

In general, when splitting data for deep learning models, common practices include using a random stratified sampling technique to maintain class distribution across different subsets. Typically, the data is divided into three parts: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set helps tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set evaluates the final performance of the trained model.

However, without more detailed information about this particular study, we cannot definitively state which specific criteria were employed to divide the data for deep learning model training.
