In the given research paper, several deep learning-based models are employed for various tasks. However, based on the provided context, it cannot be explicitly stated which specific type of deep learning model (CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.) is used in the overall pipeline. Nevertheless, there are some indications about the types of models used in certain parts of the study. For instance, the authors mention using TensorFlow, a popular open-source library for machine learning, particularly known for its support for building and deploying neural networks. Furthermore, they discuss implementing deep learning models such as FCN (Fully Convolutional Network), U-Net, and SegNet, all of which are primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These models are utilized for tasks like semantic segmentation and image classification. Therefore, while it cannot be definitively confirmed without additional information, it appears that the researchers predominantly use CNN-based models in their pipeline.
