The research paper does not explicitly mention any specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common machine learning practices, one possible criterion could be monitoring the validation loss during training. When the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, this might indicate overfitting, and the training process can be stopped. Another commonly used criterion is setting a predefined number of epochs or iterations beforehand. In this study, since the authors do not discuss these details, we cannot definitively state what criteria they used to determine when training was complete.
