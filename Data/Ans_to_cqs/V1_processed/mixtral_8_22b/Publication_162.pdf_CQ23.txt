The authors do not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, D-Mask R-CNN. However, they do discuss some aspects related to this topic. They normalize all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. This step can help improve the performance and generalization of the model. Additionally, they use weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. Using pre-trained weights can often lead to better generalization since these models have already been trained on large and diverse datasets. Lastly, the authors evaluate their model only on instances of deer, which is the most common species in their RGB-D dataset. While this does not directly address generalizability across different species, focusing on the most common species may still provide insights into how well the model could perform when applied to other species.
