To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which included various types of ecological monitoring data. This helped in capturing different aspects of aquatic ecosystem health and prevented overfitting on any specific type of data. Secondly, a 10-fold cross-validation technique was employed during the training process. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or folds, where each fold serves as a testing set once while the remaining folds are used for training. This method helps in reducing the risk of overfitting and provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Lastly, stratified splitting was likely implemented when creating the folds for cross-validation. Stratified splitting ensures that each fold maintains the same distribution of classes or labels as present in the original dataset. This approach prevents any class imbalance issues and improves the overall reliability of the model's predictions.
