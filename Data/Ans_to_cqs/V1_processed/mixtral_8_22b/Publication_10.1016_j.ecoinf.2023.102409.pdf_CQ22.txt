The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean IoU (MIoU), Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. IoU measures the overlap between the predicted and actual bounding boxes, while MIoU calculates the mean IoU for each class separately and then averages them. MPA evaluates the accuracy of pixel-level classification by measuring the ratio of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels. Accuracy represents the proportion of accurately predicted data points from the entire dataset. Precision ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better discrimination between negative samples. Recall also ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better identification of positive samples. The F1 score, which ranges from 0 to 1, reflects the model's robustness, with higher scores indicating better performance.
