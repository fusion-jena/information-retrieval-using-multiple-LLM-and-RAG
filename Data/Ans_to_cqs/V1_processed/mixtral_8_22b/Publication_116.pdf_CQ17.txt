The table titled "GoogleNet Architecture" shows various types of operations performed during the processing of input data through the network. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization. Nevertheless, there are some indications of possible regularization methods being employed. For instance, the presence of max pooling and average pooling layers suggests that these could serve as forms of regularization, helping to reduce overfitting by downsampling the spatial dimensions of the output volume. Additionally, the inclusion of batch normalization after certain layers might also contribute towards preventing overfitting, as this technique helps stabilize the learning process and reduces the need for careful parameter initialization. Lastly, the use of multiple inception modules within the network could potentially act as another form of regularization, encouraging the model to learn more diverse features and thus improving its ability to generalize well to new data.
