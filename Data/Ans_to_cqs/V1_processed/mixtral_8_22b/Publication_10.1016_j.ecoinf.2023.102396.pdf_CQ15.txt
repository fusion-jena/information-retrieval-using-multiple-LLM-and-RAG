Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, etc. However, it discusses the application of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in aligning time series data. DTW uses dynamic programming to find the optimal alignment between two sequences by minimizing the overall distance or cost. This process involves creating an accumulated cost matrix and finding the least cost path from start to finish. It also mentions the use of the Sakoe-Chiba band to constrain the search space during the dynamic programming phase of DTW. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
