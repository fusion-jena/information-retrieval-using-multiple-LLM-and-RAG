In the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on common practices in deep learning models like Mask R-CNN, we can infer that one possible criterion could be monitoring the validation loss over epochs. When the validation loss stops decreasing significantly or starts increasing, it might indicate that the model is starting to overfit the training data, suggesting that training should be stopped. Another commonly used criterion is setting a predefined maximum number of epochs, such as the mentioned 20 epochs in the context. In this case, even if the validation loss hasn't reached its minimum yet, training would still stop once the specified number of epochs is completed.
