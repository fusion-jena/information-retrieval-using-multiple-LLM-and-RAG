In the given context, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The researchers expanded their dataset by incorporating multi-temporal image data drawn from a three-month span across three different environments. They used the pretrained ResNet-34 architecture, which is a variant of the Residual Network family widely used for deep learning tasks, particularly in computer vision. The Convolutional Autoencoder and its variations were also employed to extract critical features and minimize noise within the training data. The processed image dataset was organized into 18 folders, one for each of the 450m transects. Automatic data augmentation and normalization were performed using the ImageNet statistics, including resizing the images to 224 x 224 pixels. Therefore, the main data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
