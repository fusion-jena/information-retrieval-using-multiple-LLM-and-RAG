The text does not directly discuss handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or managing random seed values. However, it describes methods used in a hybrid Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm combined with a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which involves elements of randomness.

To manage randomness in the MCMC process, the algorithm selects a random row from the genetic algorithm output database within the range [1, nMCMC]. This selection introduces variability into the process. Subsequently, the best parameter values are absorbed, assumed to be the mean of a Gaussian distribution (μ), with an associated variance defined as a fixed value σ² = (0.2 μ)². Random values are generated from these distributions for each parameter using the random.normal() function.

For the GA, random combinations of initial values are generated from the first quarter of values stored in the Python dictionary. These combinations serve as inputs for the least squares (LS) fitting procedure. Each new combination of best fit values calculated during the iterations of the genetic algorithm is stored in the database along with previously estimated sets of values.

While these techniques do not explicitly address handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, they demonstrate how randomness can be managed in related computational processes involving optimization and sampling. Incorporating randomness allows exploration of different solutions and prevents the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima. Similar principles could potentially apply when dealing with randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as setting random seeds for reproducibility or employing stochastic algorithms like dropout for regularization.
