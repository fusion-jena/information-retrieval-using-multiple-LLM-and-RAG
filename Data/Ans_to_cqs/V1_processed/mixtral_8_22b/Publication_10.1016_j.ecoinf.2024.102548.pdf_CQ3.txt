The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning pipelines, some possible data annotation techniques could include bounding box annotations, semantic segmentation, or instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest within images, which can be useful for object detection tasks. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class label, providing more detailed information about the spatial layout of objects within the scene. Instance segmentation combines elements of both object detection and semantic segmentation, where individual instances of objects are identified and labeled separately. Without further context, it cannot be determined which specific data annotation techniques were used in this particular study.
