Based on the provided information, it appears that several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Firstly, despite the lack of existing quality data, a new dataset was created specifically for the project. This custom dataset, while relatively small compared to those used in many deep learning projects, was designed to test the model under difficult circumstances and complex backgrounds. This approach aimed to improve the robustness and applicability of the model across various scenarios.

Secondly, the model was evaluated using multiple metrics such as precision, recall, F1, GIoU, and mAP. These evaluation methods provide comprehensive insights into the model's performance, helping to identify potential areas of improvement and ensuring that the model can accurately detect objects within the dataset.

Thirdly, the choice of the Adam learning rate optimizer over the static stochastic gradient descent (SGD) was made due to findings suggesting that Adam yields higher model accuracies than static learning rates, especially on smaller datasets. This decision aligns with the goal of achieving high performance even with limited data availability.

Lastly, hyperparameter settings were determined based on successful implementations of YOLO in remote sensing cases. By adopting these proven configurations, the researchers aimed to maximize the effectiveness of their model and enhance its ability to generalize well to unseen data.

However, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting being employed in this case. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into subsets and iteratively testing the model on different combinations of them, while stratified splitting ensures that class distributions remain consistent across splits. These methods could have been utilized to further validate the model's performance and strengthen its generalization capabilities.
