Based on the given context, it does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the bibliographic information was collected using the DCI for each record, including authors/creators, year of publication, title of the dataset, publisher, version, and permanent identifier. It also lists some of the top repositories where the data was sourced from, such as Figshare, Zenodo, Dryad, Ag Data Commons, KNB Data Repository, ZALF Open Research Data, AEDA, and CSIRO Data Access Portal. Therefore, we can infer that one method used for collecting raw data could be through accessing these repositories and downloading relevant datasets. Additionally, since the records collected were published from 1900 to the present, it suggests that historical data may also be included in the analysis. However, without further context, it cannot be confirmed if other methods such as surveys or sensors were employed for data collection.
