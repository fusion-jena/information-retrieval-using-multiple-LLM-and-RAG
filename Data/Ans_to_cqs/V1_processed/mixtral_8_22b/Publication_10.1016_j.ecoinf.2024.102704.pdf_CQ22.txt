In evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, several metrics are commonly employed. This study specifically uses precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) as evaluation indicators of the model detection accuracy. Precision refers to the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly. Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a measure of how well the model performs when it comes to predicting multiple classes or labels. It calculates the average precision value for recall values between 0 and 1. The computational methodology for each of these metrics is detailed in the supplementary materials.
