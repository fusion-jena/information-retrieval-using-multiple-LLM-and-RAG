The given context does not provide information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the app does not require submission of photographic evidence, which could have been used for image annotation tasks such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context also suggests that the app relies on the dive guide to validate the species sighted and reported, indicating possible manual verification methods rather than automated annotations. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
