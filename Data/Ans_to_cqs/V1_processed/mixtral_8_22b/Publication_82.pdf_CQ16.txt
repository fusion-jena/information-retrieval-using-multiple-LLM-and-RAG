The authors do not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred from the given information that the training process continues until convergence or completion of a predetermined number of epochs. In this case, each experiment ran for a total of 30 epochs, where one epoch is defined as the number of training iterations required for the neural network to fully pass through the entire training set once. Additionally, the authors mention that the learning always converges well within 30 epochs, suggesting that convergence may serve as a criterion for determining when training should stop.
