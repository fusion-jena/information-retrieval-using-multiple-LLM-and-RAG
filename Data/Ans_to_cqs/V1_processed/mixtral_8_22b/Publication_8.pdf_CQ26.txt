Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some general principles and practices related to this topic can still be discussed.

Data bias can occur due to various reasons like class imbalance, skewed distribution, or lack of diversity in the dataset. To mitigate these issues, several strategies can be employed during preprocessing. One popular method is stratified sampling, which ensures that each class is proportionally represented in both the training and validation sets. This helps maintain the balance between classes and prevents any single class from dominating the model's predictions.

Another technique to handle class imbalance is resampling, which involves either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class. Oversampling increases the instances of the underrepresented class by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic ones using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). On the other hand, undersampling reduces the instances of the overrepresented class by randomly removing samples or selecting only the most informative ones. Both approaches aim to achieve a balanced distribution across classes.

Lastly, collecting diverse data is crucial to ensure that the trained models generalize well to unseen examples. A diverse dataset should ideally cover different variations within each class, including edge cases and rare scenarios. This not only improves the robustness of the model but also minimizes potential biases introduced by limited or homogeneous data sources.

While the context does not explicitly discuss these techniques, they are commonly applied in practice when dealing with data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines.
