The provided context does not directly address the specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some general approaches to manage randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or ensemble methods to reduce variability caused by random initialization, and employing deterministic algorithms where possible. It should also be noted that the use of large amounts of training data can help mitigate the effects of randomness in model initialization and parameter updates during optimization.
