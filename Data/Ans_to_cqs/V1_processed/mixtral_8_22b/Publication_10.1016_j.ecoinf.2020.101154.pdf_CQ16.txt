The criterion used to determine when training is complete for the RI models is early stopping. Early stopping is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting by terminating the training process before the model starts to fit the noise in the training dataset. It works by monitoring the validation error during training and stopping the training process when the validation error stops decreasing or begins to increase. For the RI models, the number of iterations required until convergence was determined using early stopping, resulting in 120 iterations for the CS model and 106 iterations for the NW model. Grid search was not required for a three-part split, and further tuning of the parameters was done manually.
