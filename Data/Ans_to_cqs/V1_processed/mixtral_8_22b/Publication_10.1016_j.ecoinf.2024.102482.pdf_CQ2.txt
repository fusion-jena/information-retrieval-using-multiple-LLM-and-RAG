The papers cited provide examples of different types of data used in deep learning pipelines for ecological applications. For instance, Fernandes et al. (2016) use time series data from sensors to monitor the locomotor behavior of zebrafish. Similarly, Cho et al. (2014) employ textual data for statistical machine translation tasks. On the other hand, Concepcion et al. (2023) utilize images of bivalve shells for species identification and traceability purposes. Furthermore, Dun et al. (2022) apply spatial-temporal data for air quality predictions. Lastly, Mortezavi et al. (2023) use historical hydrologic data for streamflow forecasting. Therefore, the data formats used in these studies include time series, text, images, spatial-temporal data, and structured datasets like CSV files.
