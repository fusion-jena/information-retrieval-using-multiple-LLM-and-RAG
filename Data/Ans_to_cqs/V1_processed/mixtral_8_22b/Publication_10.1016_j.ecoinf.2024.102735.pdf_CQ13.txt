The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it is mentioned that the ensemble models were developed using Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. The hyperparameters for these models were obtained through optimization using the Optuna package, which employs complex optimization algorithms to find the best combination of hyperparameters that minimize the mean squared error. The figure included in the context suggests that the hyperparameters for SVR include C, epsilon, gamma, and kernel. Additionally, the text mentions that the number of estimators (n\_estimators) was one of the hyperparameters for the RF models. Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of the learning rate or optimizer used in this study.
