After reviewing the given context, it appears that specific details about certain hyperparameters such as the learning rate and optimizer used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, some information regarding the architecture and other aspects of the model can still be found.

In this case, the deep learning model was developed using TensorFlow, an open-source platform for deep learning. During the development process, several hyperparameters needed to be tuned before training the model. Through iterative grid search parameter tuning, it was determined that the model would use five hidden layers (Hj, j = 1, 2,..., 5), although the exact number of neurons (n) in each layer is not specified.

Additionally, the training process involved exposing all the training data to the network for a number of iterations until the loss function reached its minimum value. This occurred after approximately 5000 iterations using a NVIDIA Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The total number of trainable parameters was 85,569, and the computational runtime was around four hours with a training batch size of 1024.

While these details provide valuable insights into the structure and training process of the deep learning model, they do not directly address the requested hyperparameters like the learning rate and optimizer. It seems that further information would be required to fully answer the query.
