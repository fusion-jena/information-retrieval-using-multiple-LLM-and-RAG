The text does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it mentions that the Random Forest algorithm was employed with its default hyperparameters in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) implementation, except for the number of trees, which was set to 500. Unfortunately, there is no information about the learning rate or optimizer since these terms are typically associated with neural networks rather than decision tree algorithms like Random Forest. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
