The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is object detection. This type of model is designed to take images as input and use a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) as its backbone network to construct feature maps. A Region Proposal Network then generates region proposals, assigning a probability for containing an object to each region. These derived region proposals are reshaped by a pooling layer to generate Regions of Interest (RoIs). Finally, classification and bounding box regression are employed to predict both the presence and location of objects within the original images. Such models are often referred to as 'two-stage detectors' due to their two-step process.
