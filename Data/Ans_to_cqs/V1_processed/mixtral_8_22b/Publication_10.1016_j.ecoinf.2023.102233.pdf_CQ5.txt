The datasets used in this deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned by name but are referred to as the training/validation dataset and the test dataset. The training/validation dataset consisted of 6363 hours of audio from ten independent sites, recorded by both solar-powered bioacoustic recorders and Audiomoth recorders. The test dataset included 2735 hours of audio from nine independent sites, also recorded by both types of devices. These datasets were unlabelled at the start of the study. It appears that these custom datasets were created specifically for this project rather than being standardized datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
