The information provided does not mention any specific details about the availability or location of a deep learning pipeline code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It could be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but without explicit information, I can't confirm its exact location.
