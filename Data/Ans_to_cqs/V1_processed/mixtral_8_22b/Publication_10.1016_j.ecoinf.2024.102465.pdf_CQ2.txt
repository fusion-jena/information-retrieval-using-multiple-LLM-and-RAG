Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data. This is evident from the use of the HRNet model, which is employed for semantic segmentation of social media image data. Additionally, the study mentions collecting relevant reviews with images from various platforms such as Weibo, Dianping, and Ctrip. Furthermore, the NLP model is used to score the text content in the valid data, indicating that text data might also be part of the pipeline. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio or video being used in this particular study. Therefore, we can conclude that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data, along with some text data.
