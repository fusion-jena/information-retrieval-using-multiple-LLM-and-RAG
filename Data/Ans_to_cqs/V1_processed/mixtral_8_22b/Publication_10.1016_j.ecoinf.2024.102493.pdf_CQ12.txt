The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series NDVI prediction in one of the cited papers (Guo et al., 2023b). Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline might involve the use of LSTMs, which are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
