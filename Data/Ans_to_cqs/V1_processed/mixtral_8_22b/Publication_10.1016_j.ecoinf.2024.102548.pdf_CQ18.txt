The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training was based on the accuracy metric. Each model underwent training for 10 epochs, utilizing a batch size of 32. The class mode was set to 'categorical,' indicating that the labels were encoded using one-hot encoding for multi-class classification tasks. These generalized parameter settings were consistently applied across all models, ensuring comparability and standardization throughout the study experiments.
