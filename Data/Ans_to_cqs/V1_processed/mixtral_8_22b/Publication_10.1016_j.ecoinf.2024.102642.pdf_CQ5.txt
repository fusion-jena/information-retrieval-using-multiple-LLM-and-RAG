The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for evaluating the performance of the CNNs include SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale’s Dcalls. For the SEIO PBW vocalizations, 7 hours of audio signals recorded during the OHASISBIO program were used. These recordings were collected at the SWAMS site, located in the Indian Ocean’s oceanic zone, between Kerguelen and Amsterdam Island. This dataset is referred to as SWAMS in the paper. The recordings were made in March 2015 using a hydrophone deployed at a depth of 1000 meters. The sampling rate was 240 Hz. A total of 102 vocalizations were manually annotated by a second expert.
