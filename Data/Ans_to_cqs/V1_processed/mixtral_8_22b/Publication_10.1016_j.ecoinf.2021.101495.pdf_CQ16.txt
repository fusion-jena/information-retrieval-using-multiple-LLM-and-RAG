The given context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, it can be inferred from common machine learning practices that some possible criteria could include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation dataset, observing a plateau or decrease in the validation loss, or meeting other predefined stopping conditions. In this case, since the table shows the total number of segments for each label used during the classification by species, it might suggest that the training was stopped after a fixed number of iterations or epochs. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about the training process, we cannot definitively state what criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
