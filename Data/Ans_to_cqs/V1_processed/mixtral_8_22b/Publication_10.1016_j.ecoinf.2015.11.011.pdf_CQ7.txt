The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, based on general best practices in machine learning, common criteria include splitting the dataset into three parts: training, testing, and validation datasets. Typically, the training dataset is used to fit the model, while the testing dataset is used to evaluate its performance during the training phase. Finally, the validation dataset is used to assess the final model's ability to generalize to unseen data. The proportion of each split can vary depending on the specific application and size of the dataset, but a commonly used ratio is 70/15/15 or 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing respectively.
