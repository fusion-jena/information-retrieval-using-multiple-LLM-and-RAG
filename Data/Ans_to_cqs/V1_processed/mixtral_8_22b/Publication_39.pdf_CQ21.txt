Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, some insights can be derived indirectly.

For instance, during the evaluation phase, the concept of True Positive (TP) detections is mentioned, which involves setting thresholds for confidence scores and Intersection over Union (IoU), and ensuring the correctness of class predictions. This suggests that metrics calculation could potentially be part of the postprocessing steps.

Additionally, since Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is used as the optimization technique, it might imply that performance metrics such as accuracy or loss would need to be calculated post-training.

However, without more direct information, it cannot be definitively stated what other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrices are involved. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, the exact postprocessing steps remain unclear.
