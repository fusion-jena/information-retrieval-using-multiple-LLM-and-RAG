Based on the given context, it appears there is no information regarding data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, scaling, etc. The context primarily discusses various Best Management Practices (BMPs) for water quality improvement, including filter, WQ inlets, weekly street sweeping, wet pond, wetland detention, infiltration devices, extended wet detention, and LID/dry well. It also mentions their respective efficiencies in removing Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Additionally, references to several documents related to watershed management, environmental justice, and flood risks in Florida are included. However, none of these sources provide any insight into data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine what data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline.
