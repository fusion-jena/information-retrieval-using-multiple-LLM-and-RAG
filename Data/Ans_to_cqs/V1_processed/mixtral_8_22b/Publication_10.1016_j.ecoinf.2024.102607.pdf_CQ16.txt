The given context does not provide information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed. However, common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation set, observing a plateau in the validation loss, or meeting some predefined threshold for a metric such as accuracy or F1 score. These criteria can vary depending on the specific machine learning task and dataset being used.

The context mentions several experiments (EXP1 through EXP5) using different models and methods for Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification mapping. It also includes figures comparing the results of these experiments using metrics like overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient. However, it does not explicitly state what criteria were used to determine when each experiment was considered complete. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based solely on the given context.
