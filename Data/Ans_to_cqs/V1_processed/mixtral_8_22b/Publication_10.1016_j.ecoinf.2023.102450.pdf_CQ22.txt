The text does not explicitly mention which specific metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does discuss two metrics commonly used for evaluating object-tracking algorithms: precision and success plots. Precision is evaluated using the center location error of the tracking algorithm, where a higher precision plot indicates a more accurate center location. This metric calculates the average Euclidean distance between the centroid locations of the tracked targets and the manually labeled ground truths. Additionally, the percentage of video frames is considered based on Euclidean distance values existing within a specified threshold. Although these metrics are mentioned in the context of object-tracking algorithms, they could potentially be applied or adapted to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model discussed in the given context.
