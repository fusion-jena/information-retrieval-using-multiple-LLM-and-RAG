The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several ways to collect raw data for such purposes. These include conducting surveys or interviews, using sensors or IoT devices, accessing publicly available datasets, scraping websites, utilizing APIs, and more. The choice of method depends on the nature of the problem being addressed and the type of data required. For instance, if the task is image recognition, then images could be collected through cameras or downloaded from online databases. Similarly, for natural language processing tasks, textual data might be gathered via web scraping or social media platforms. It should also be noted that the quality and quantity of data play crucial roles in training effective deep learning models. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the chosen data collection method provides sufficient and relevant data.
