The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that some networks were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. Additionally, the text refers to mean centering the image with ImageNet values during preprocessing, further suggesting the use of ImageNet. Unfortunately, there is no mention of other datasets like MNIST or CIFAR.
