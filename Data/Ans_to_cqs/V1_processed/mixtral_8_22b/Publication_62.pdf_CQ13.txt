The information provided does not include specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only provides information on the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including the types and shapes of the constitutive layers. To find out more about the hyperparameters used in these models, one would need access to the source code or additional documentation from the authors.
