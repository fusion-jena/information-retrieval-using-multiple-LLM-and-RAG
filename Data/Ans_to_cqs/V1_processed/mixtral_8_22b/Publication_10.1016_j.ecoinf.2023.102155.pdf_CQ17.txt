The text mentions several regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, specifically in the context of regression techniques rather than deep learning pipelines. These include lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net regression.

Lasso regression, introduced by Tibshirani in 1996, imposes a penalty on parameter coefficients to prevent them from growing too large. This technique helps in reducing coefficient instability, especially when dealing with small sample sizes, and assists in selecting relevant variables.

Ridge regression, proposed by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970, is another form of regularization that adds a penalty term to the loss function during model training. This penalty discourages large weights, which can lead to overfitting. Ridge regression is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity among features.

Elastic net regression, developed by Friedman et al. in 2010, is a combination of both lasso and ridge regressions. It uses a mix of L1 and L2 penalties, providing a balance between variable selection and shrinkage properties. Elastic net regression is beneficial when working with high-dimensional data where the number of features exceeds the number of samples.

While these regularization methods are discussed within the context of regression techniques, they share some similarities with regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. For instance, dropout is a popular regularization technique in deep learning that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting. Similarly, L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function based on the square of the magnitude of the weights, much like ridge regression.
