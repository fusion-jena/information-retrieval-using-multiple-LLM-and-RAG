The sources provided do not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, some clues can be found within the context. For instance, Teixeira et al. (2022) discuss nest monitoring of endangered black-cockatoos using bioacoustics and open-source call recognition, suggesting that audio recording devices such as microphones might have been employed for data collection. Similarly, Ross et al. (2023) talk about passive acoustic monitoring, implying the use of sound recording equipment like hydrophones or remote sensing technology. Roh et al. (2019) provide a comprehensive overview of various data collection techniques for machine learning from a big data-AI integration perspective, but they do not specifically focus on the case of this research. Lastly, Ruff et al. (2020, 2021) describe workflows and convolutional neural networks for automated identification of animal sounds, indicating that their studies likely involved gathering audio data through field recordings or similar means. Therefore, while there isn't explicit information regarding the exact methods used for collecting raw data in the given sources, it can be inferred that audio recording devices and possibly remote sensing technologies may have played significant roles in acquiring relevant data for the deep learning pipeline.
