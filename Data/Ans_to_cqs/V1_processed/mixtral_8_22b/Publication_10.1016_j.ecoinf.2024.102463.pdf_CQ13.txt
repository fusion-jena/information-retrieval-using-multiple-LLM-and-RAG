Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the model likely includes hyperparameters related to its architecture, including the types of layers (convolutional or recurrent), the number of layers, and their respective sizes. Additionally, since the text mentions using the HyperBand algorithm for optimization, this suggests that there may also be hyperparameters related to the training process itself, such as batch size, epochs, or early stopping criteria. Ultimately, without additional context or clarification, it is difficult to provide a definitive list of all the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
