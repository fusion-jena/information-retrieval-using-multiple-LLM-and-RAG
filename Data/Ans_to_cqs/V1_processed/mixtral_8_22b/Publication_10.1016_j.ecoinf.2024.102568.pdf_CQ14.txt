The paper does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, based on the given context, it can be inferred that some form of parameter optimization was performed, possibly using techniques such as grid search or random search. This assumption is supported by the mention of parameters optimization in the first reference [1]. Additionally, the use of Adam, a popular algorithm for stochastic optimization, suggests that some level of hyperparameter tuning may have been involved [3]. Nevertheless, without more specific details from the authors, it remains uncertain which exact method was employed for hyperparameter optimization.
