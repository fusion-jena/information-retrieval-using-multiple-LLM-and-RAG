The purpose of the deep learning models employed in this study is to perform semantic segmentation tasks within an urban area located in the Cerrado biome. These models take an image as input and output another image of the same size, where each pixel is associated with a specific class. The goal is to identify and label different objects or regions within the input image accurately. In particular, these models aim to detect trees in urban areas, which can contribute to nature conservation efforts in the region. The five state-of-the-art deep learning architectures used include FCN, U-Net, SegNet, DeepLabv3+, and PSPNet. Each of these architectures has been developed to address various computer vision tasks, such as object recognition, image segmentation, and scene understanding. However, their application in this research focuses specifically on semantic segmentation for tree detection in urban environments.
