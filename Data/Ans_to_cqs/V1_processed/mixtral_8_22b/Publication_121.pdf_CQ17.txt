In the given context, one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is mentioned - Dropout. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to avoid overfitting by providing a way of approximately combining exponentially many different neural network architectures efficiently [7]. This method has been shown to improve the performance of various types of neural networks on a wide range of tasks. However, it should be noted that there are also other regularization methods available, such as L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and reducing overfitting. Other methods include early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization. Each method has its own advantages and can be chosen depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.
