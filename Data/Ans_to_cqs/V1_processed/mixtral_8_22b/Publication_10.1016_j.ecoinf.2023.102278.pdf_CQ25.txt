The purpose of the deep learning model described in this study is for hierarchical classification of insect species based on images. This involves identifying the order, family, and species of insects within a taxonomic hierarchy. The authors propose a multitask convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses ResNet or EfficientNet as its base model. The network takes an input image and transforms it through the CNN, producing a root representation. For each level in the taxonomy, two fully connected (FC) layers and an activation function are added to perform a non-linear transformation of the input to the level output. The goal is to accurately predict the classes at each level of the taxonomy while minimizing uncertainty. Data augmentation techniques were employed during training to improve the model's ability to generalize and avoid overfitting.
