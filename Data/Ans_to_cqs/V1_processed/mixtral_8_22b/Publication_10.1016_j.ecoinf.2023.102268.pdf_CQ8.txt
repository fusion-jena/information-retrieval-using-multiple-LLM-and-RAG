According to the given information, the detection, feature extraction, and classification workflow developed in this paper has been implemented in a set of MATLAB codes. However, there is no explicit mention of where these codes or any related repositories are publicly available, such as on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, without further specific details, it cannot be determined where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
