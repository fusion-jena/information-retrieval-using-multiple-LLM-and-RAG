The text does not provide explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that central-pixel labeling and semantic labeling are employed as part of the training process. These techniques could be considered as forms of pixel-level annotations or semantic segmentations.

Central-pixel labeling involves assigning labels to individual pixels within an image, while semantic labeling refers to categorizing entire regions or objects within an image into predefined classes. Both these techniques help train neural networks for tasks such as object recognition, classification, and segmentation.

In terms of creating balanced datasets, which is crucial for optimal model performance, the authors mention that they made balanced datasets with the initial pixels selection used for learning in the case of central-pixel labeling architectures. For semantic labeling, where controlling the exact number of pixels per class becomes challenging due to image composition, various methods were attempted, though no significant improvements were observed. Ultimately, the median frequency balancing method was adopted for all reported experiments.
