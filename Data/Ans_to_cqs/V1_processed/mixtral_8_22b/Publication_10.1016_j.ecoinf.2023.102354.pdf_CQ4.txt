The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of the linear interpolation technique to fill up missing data based on subsequent months. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, scaling, etc., are commonly used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. But there is no mention of these techniques being applied in this case.
