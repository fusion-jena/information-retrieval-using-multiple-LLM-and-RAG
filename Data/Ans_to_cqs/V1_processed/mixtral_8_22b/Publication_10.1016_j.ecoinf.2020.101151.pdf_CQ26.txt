Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, the text does mention the use of the nine-cell approach to smooth out existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells, which could be considered a technique to mitigate potential biases in the data. Additionally, the study combines various data layers using different weighting approaches to test the sensitivity of parameter combinations in predicting forest fire danger. This process might also help reduce any potential biases introduced by individual datasets. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the application of techniques like stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, we cannot definitively state whether these methods were employed in this particular case.
