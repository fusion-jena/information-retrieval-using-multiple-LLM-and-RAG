The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves observing the total loss after each epoch. In this case, the best model with transfer learning was selected based on the minimum total loss observed after nine epochs. Overfitting was monitored by checking if the validation loss started increasing while keeping track of the difference between training and validation losses. Additionally, the bias was also considered, which is the loss evaluated on the training dataset. To further ensure optimal performance, the largest variation in accuracy was kept minimal, indicating a minimal impact on the change of accuracy for different choices of alpha.
