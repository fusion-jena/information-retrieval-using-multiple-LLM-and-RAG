The provided context does not explicitly mention specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that various sources of data collection have been employed across different studies. For instance, Antoine-Santoni et al. (2018) discuss the use of wireless tracking and sensor systems to monitor animal behavior, suggesting the utilization of sensor technology for gathering raw data. Additionally, Anders et al. (2021) focus on compensating class imbalance for acoustic chimpanzee detection, implying the use of audio recordings or sound sensors for data acquisition. Furthermore, Atila et al. (2021) work on plant leaf disease classification using images, indicating the usage of image databases or cameras for capturing visual information. Lastly, Bakana et al. (2020) address mitigating wildlife poaching, possibly involving surveillance footage or drone imagery for monitoring purposes. Overall, while the exact methods may vary depending on the application, some commonly used techniques include sensors, surveys, and publicly available datasets.
