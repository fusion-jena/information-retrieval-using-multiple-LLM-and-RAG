The datasets used in this deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as being well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors have created their own custom datasets using images collected from time-lapse cameras deployed in Finnmark and Yamal regions. They have manually classified these images into 'Good' and 'Bad' categories based on their quality. For training purposes, they have randomly selected approximately 15,000 'Bad' quality images and around 57,000 'Good' quality images from each location. These images were then further examined and corrected if necessary. Therefore, the datasets used in this study are specific to Arctic wildlife monitoring and are not standard machine learning benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
