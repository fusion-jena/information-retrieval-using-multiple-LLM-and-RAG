The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the study involves applications of deep convolutional neural networks to digitized natural images. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset might consist of digitized natural images, possibly from a collection or database related to natural history collections (NHCs), given the focus on supporting public health, safety, and agriculture, as well as understanding biodiversity and studying various aspects such as evolution, habitat loss, biological invasion, and climate change. Unfortunately, without more explicit details about the dataset, we cannot definitively state which specific dataset was used in this case.
