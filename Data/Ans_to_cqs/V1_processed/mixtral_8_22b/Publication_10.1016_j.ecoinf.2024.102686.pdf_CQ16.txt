The given text does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, based on general machine learning principles, common criteria include reaching a minimum error threshold, achieving a stable validation loss or accuracy over several epochs, or meeting a maximum iteration limit. In the case of Support Vector Machines (SVM), one might look for convergence of the objective function or a stable margin between classes. For Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), a possible stopping condition could be when the weights no longer change significantly after each iteration. Nonetheless, without more specific details from the authors regarding their chosen methodology, we cannot definitively state what criteria they employed to decide when training was complete.
