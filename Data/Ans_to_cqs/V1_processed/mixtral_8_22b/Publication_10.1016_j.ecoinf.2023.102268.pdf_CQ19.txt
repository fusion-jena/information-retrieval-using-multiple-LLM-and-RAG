Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the specific frameworks or libraries used to build the deep learning models mentioned, such as the ResNet-50 CNN or the SVM classifier. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework was used to develop these models.
