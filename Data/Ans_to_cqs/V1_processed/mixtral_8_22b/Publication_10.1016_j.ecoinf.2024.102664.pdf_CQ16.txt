Based on the given information, the criteria used to determine when training is complete involve assessing the effectiveness of validation data forecasts. The structure of all models, including hyperparameters such as kernel size and number of nodes, is determined using a method that controls variables. This involves keeping other variables constant and selecting the parameters that optimize the validation data forecast results as the modelâ€™s hyperparameters. It is also mentioned that in most instances where Adam is used as the solver and the input time series length is set to 5 days, the RMSE of the validation data forecasting results is lower. However, there is no explicit mention of specific criteria such as validation loss plateau being used to determine when training is complete.
