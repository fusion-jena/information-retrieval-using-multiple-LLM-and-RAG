The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, the text focuses on discussing the differences in results obtained by applying various datasets (original, reduced, and augmented) to different deep learning models (VGG19 and ResNet50). It also mentions the use of data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels to achieve optimal simulation results. Furthermore, the context discusses handling large dimensions of input images by disassembling them into single-band images using Python's Rasterio module. In summary, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
