The text does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models but discusses various machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, CARTs, linear discriminant analysis, random forests, and support vector machines. These algorithms have been used for the supervised learning of animal behavior based on accelerometer (ACC) data. Specifically, this study focuses on describing two popular machine learning algorithms - random forests and support vector machines - for introductory purposes. Random forests aim to reduce the variance of the model without increasing its bias, while support vector machines use deterministic approaches to choose points or support vectors to define boundaries between classes. However, it should be noted that support vector machines are binary, one-vs-all-other classifiers, requiring multiple applications to a dataset if there are numerous behavioral categories. Despite the high overall performance of random forests, they might not perform consistently across all behavioral categories. Due to the lack or shortage of behavioral observations, unsupervised learning becomes an appropriate tool for exploratory studies of novel behaviors or secretive species that are difficult to observe.

In summary, the purpose of these machine learning algorithms discussed in the given context is primarily for the classification of animal behavior based on accelerometer data. Deep learning models could potentially be employed for similar tasks, although the specific application (classification, segmentation, detection) would depend on the research objectives and available data.
