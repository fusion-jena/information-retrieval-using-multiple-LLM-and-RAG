The context does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of a dataset to train a deep learning model, which suggests that one possible method for collecting raw data could be through publicly available datasets or databases. Additionally, the context discusses challenges related to bird image data collection, including variations in lighting conditions, weather, and other environmental factors, which implies that sensor devices like cameras might have been employed to capture these images. Nonetheless, without further details, it cannot be definitively stated what specific methods were used for gathering raw data in this case.
