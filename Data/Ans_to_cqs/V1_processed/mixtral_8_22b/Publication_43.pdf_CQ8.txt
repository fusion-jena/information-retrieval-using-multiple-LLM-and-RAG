Unfortunately, there is no information provided about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The given context only discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) like ResNet and GoogLeNet for training models based on minimizing prediction loss. Additionally, it mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for updating weights during training. However, there is no reference or link to any specific code repositories or platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
