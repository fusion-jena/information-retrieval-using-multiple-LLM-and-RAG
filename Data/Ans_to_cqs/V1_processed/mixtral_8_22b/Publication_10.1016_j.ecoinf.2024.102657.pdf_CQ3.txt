The text does not provide explicit details about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that users can manually label songs by choosing one of the machine learning algorithm predictions (CNN or k-NN labels), using a different pre-existing label, or assigning the song a new label. This process is part of the Classification phase in the DialectDecoder pipeline, where the user classifies new songs the program hasn't seen before. Once the human classification is complete, the program adds the user-classified songs to the dataset for retraining. Therefore, the primary data annotation technique employed here appears to be manual labeling of audio files based on their content.
