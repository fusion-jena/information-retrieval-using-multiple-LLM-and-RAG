The context does not provide explicit details about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, or validation sets. However, it mentions that a cross-validation analysis was performed separately in 30 forest plots situated in the northern Italian Alps, in 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein (Germany), and then in all 130 plots combined. This suggests that the data might have been divided based on geographical location or plot number. Additionally, the text refers to testing the approach with a single linear regression and a multiple linear regression, which could imply that different subsets of the data were used for these tests. Nonetheless, without more detailed information, it is impossible to definitively state the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
