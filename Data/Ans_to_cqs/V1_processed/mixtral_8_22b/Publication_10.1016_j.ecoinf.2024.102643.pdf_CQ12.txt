Based on the given information, it does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning model is used in the pipeline. The mentioned models are Maximum Entropy (MAXENT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), Classification Tree Analyses (CTA), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), and Surface Response Envelope (SRE). However, none of these models are specifically classified as deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
