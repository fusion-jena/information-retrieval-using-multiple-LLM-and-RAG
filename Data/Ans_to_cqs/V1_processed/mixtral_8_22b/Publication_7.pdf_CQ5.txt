The deep learning pipeline uses two main datasets - ImageNet and Benthoz15. ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical image database containing millions of labeled images belonging to thousands of categories. It has been widely used for training deep neural networks due to its vast size and diversity. In this case, it was used to train a pre-trained VGGnet model. On the other hand, Benthoz15 is a domain-specific dataset consisting of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This dataset was used to fine-tune the weights of the pre-trained VGGnet model.
