The given context does not explicitly mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use these techniques to improve generalization and avoid overfitting. In the absence of explicit information about regularization methods used in this study, one could assume that standard practices like dropout or L2 regularization might have been employed but cannot be confirmed based solely on the provided context.
