The papers mentioned do not provide information about where the code repositories of their respective deep learning pipelines are located. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they are available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket based solely on the given context. To find out more details regarding the availability of the code repositories, further research would need to be conducted.
