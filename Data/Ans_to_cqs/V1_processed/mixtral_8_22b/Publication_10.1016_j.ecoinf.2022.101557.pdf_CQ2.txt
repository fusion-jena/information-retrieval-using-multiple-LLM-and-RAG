The text does not explicitly mention what kind of input format is used for the deep learning pipeline. However, since the authors discuss using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are typically used for processing images, it can be inferred that the input format is likely related to images. Furthermore, the authors describe splitting the data into blocks and areas of 80x80 pixels, which supports the assumption that they work with image data. Therefore, based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses image data as its input format.
