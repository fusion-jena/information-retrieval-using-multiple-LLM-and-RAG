The data and codes created in the research are available on GitHub at <https://github.com/RyokoNod/sdm-asian-elephants>. Additionally, there is an interactive map available at <https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOX_Zhf8=> for informally exploring all outputs of models. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only confirm that the data and codes are available on GitHub.
