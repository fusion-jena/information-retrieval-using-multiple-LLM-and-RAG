The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the networks were trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 32 using cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam optimizer. This suggests that monitoring the model performance might involve observing metrics like accuracy or loss over epochs during training. Additionally, since the dataset was balanced, it can be assumed that standard practices such as splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets could also be employed to evaluate the model's performance.
