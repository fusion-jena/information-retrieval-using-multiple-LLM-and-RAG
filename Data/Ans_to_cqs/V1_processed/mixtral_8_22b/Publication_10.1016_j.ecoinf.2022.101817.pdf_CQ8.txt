The text does not provide information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the use of a VGG16-based CNN architecture called "CNN Model 4" for classifying underwater images into different environmental conditions such as clear, low light, air bubbles, etc. However, it does not mention any specific details regarding the availability of the source code for this model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is located.
