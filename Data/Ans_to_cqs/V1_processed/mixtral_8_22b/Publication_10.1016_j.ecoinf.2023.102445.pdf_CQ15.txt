The given text does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does discuss various components and modules involved in building a deep learning architecture, including the Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast (SPPF) module, the neck network, and the reduce detection head.

In general, optimization techniques like SGD and Adam are employed during the training phase of deep learning models to minimize the loss function and update the model parameters iteratively. While the given text does not directly address these optimization methods, it does touch upon aspects related to improving the performance and efficiency of the deep learning pipeline.

For instance, the SPPF module is designed to enhance the model's resilience to spatial layout and object degradation by modifying parallel max pooling into a combination of serial and parallel modes. Additionally, the neck network employs feature fusion using the feature pyramid network (FPN) and the path aggregation network (PAN) to tackle the issue of multiscale feature fusion and bolster the integration and utilization of features. Furthermore, the reduce detection head incorporates a neural network (CNN) consisting of Conv2d convolution, BatchNorm2d, and an activation function to effectively extract and learn valuable feature information from input data.

While these elements contribute to optimizing the overall performance of the deep learning pipeline, they do not constitute traditional optimization techniques like SGD or Adam. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot definitively identify the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
