The given context does not provide any specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources mentioned in the context are mainly related to research papers and studies on various topics such as database extension for digital soil mapping using artificial neural networks, random forests, digital soil assessments, etc. However, none of these sources explicitly mention the availability or location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
