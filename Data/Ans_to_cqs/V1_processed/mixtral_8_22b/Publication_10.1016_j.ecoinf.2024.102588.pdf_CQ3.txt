The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have been successfully applied to estimate variables in aquatic environments. This suggests that image or video data might be involved in the process, potentially requiring annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Nevertheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot confirm the use of these specific annotation techniques.
