The paper does not explicitly mention any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models. However, it is common practice in deep learning research to use these methods to improve the robustness and reliability of the models. Therefore, while not directly stated, it is possible that some of these techniques could have been employed during the development and training of the deep learning models described in this study.

I am sorry, I cannot find information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in the given context.
