The text does not provide explicit information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it mentions that the dataset was randomly divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing, with 60%, 20%, and 20% of the data allocated respectively.

Regarding handling potential biases due to class imbalance or other factors, the text discusses using data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training data, which is known to generally improve classification accuracy. Additionally, applying various image preprocessing techniques like resizing, removing background, image enhancement, and denoising can help improve the performance of the models. These methods may indirectly contribute to addressing data bias but do not directly target specific types of bias mentioned in the query.
