The given context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions several studies that use remote sensing techniques for analyzing various types of forests and land covers. This suggests that satellite or airborne imagery could be one source of raw data collection. Additionally, some papers mention using spectral bands, which are often collected through multispectral or hyperspectral sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft. Public datasets like Google Earth Engine might also be used as sources of raw data. In summary, while the exact methods for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated, the context implies that remote sensing techniques, such as satellite or airborne imagery and spectral band data, may be employed.
