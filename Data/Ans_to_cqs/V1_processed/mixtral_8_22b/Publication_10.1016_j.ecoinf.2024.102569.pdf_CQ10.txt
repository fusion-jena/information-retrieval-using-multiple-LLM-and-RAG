Unfortunately, based on the given context, I cannot provide a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The information provided does not include any specific details about the source code or its location. It mainly discusses various environmental factors, data sources like GBIF, and challenges related to analyzing presence-only (PO) data. Therefore, without additional context or information, it would be impossible to determine the exact code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the study.
