Based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it appears that the authors have created their own dataset using trails collected from free-ranging Amur tigers. These trails were then divided into sub-trails based on the number of footprints present. It seems that these trails and sub-trails form the basis of the dataset used for training and testing the deep learning models. Therefore, without further clarification, it cannot be definitively stated which standard datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
