The text does not provide explicit information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models and the process of tuning their hyperparameters. Specifically, the'regularization parameter (C)' and the 'kernel type (linear)' were adjusted using a combination of grid search and cross-validation techniques. Additionally, when dealing with non-linear SVMs, the 'kernel coefficient (gamma)' also underwent optimization via grid search. It is important to note that these hyperparameters pertain specifically to the SVM models mentioned in the text, rather than a generic deep learning model.
