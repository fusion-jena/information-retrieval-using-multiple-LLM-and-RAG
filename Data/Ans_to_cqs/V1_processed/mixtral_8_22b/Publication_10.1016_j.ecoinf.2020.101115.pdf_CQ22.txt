Based on the given context, there is no direct mention of specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, common metrics used in evaluating deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positives out of actual positives. F1 score combines both precision and recall into a single metric. ROC curve plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate, while Confusion Matrix provides a visual summary of prediction results.
