The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's kappa (κ). Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as positive, while specificity measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as negative. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of instances. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, and recall is the same as sensitivity. Finally, Cohen's kappa (κ) is a statistical measure that compares observed accuracy with expected accuracy due to chance alone. These metrics provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the deep learning model and help researchers improve their models.
