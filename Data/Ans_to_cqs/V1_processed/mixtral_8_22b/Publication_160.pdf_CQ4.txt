The authors applied several data augmentation techniques to allow for better generalization and compensate for the high class imbalance. These techniques include random rotations between 0 and 180 degrees, brightness scaling between 0.4 and 1.6, and horizontal/vertical flipping. These transformations were applied to all patches on the fly as data was fed into the networks during training.
