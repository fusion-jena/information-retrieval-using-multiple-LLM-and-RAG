The authors do not provide explicit information regarding the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. However, they mention using a diverse dataset from multiple sources, including remote sensing images, meteorological data, soil data, and land use/cover data. They also discuss employing a multi-scale analysis approach, comparing Q values for each driver at various grid scales. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been used during the development and evaluation of their model. Nevertheless, without more detailed information about their methodology, it cannot be confirmed whether these techniques were indeed applied.
