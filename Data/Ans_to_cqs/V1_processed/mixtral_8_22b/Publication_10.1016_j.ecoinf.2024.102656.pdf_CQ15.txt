The study does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), and others. These methods help minimize the loss function during training, allowing the model to learn from the data more effectively. Without explicit mention in the given text, it is impossible to determine which technique was employed in this particular case.

Based on the provided context, I cannot directly answer the query regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on ungulate conservation in Iran, discussing factors such as land use changes, road construction, and mining affecting their habitats. It also presents results related to core habitats, connectivity predictions, and the measurement of core habitats and corridors within Conservation Areas (CAs). Therefore, there is no information available about any optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.
