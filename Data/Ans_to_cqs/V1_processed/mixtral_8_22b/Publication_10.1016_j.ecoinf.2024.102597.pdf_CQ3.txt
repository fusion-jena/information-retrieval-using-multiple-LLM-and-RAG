The given context does not provide any specific details regarding the use of data annotation techniques in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key-point annotation, and landmark annotation. Each technique serves a different purpose depending on the type of dataset being used and the problem being solved. For example, bounding box annotation is often used for object detection tasks, while semantic segmentation is commonly used for image segmentation tasks. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to identify individual objects within an image and their corresponding pixels. Polygon annotation involves drawing shapes around objects or regions of interest, while key-point annotation involves identifying specific points on an object or person. Landmark annotation is similar to key-point annotation but focuses more on facial recognition tasks. Again, without further context, it cannot be determined which specific data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the original text.
