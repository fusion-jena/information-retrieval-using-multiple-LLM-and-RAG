The given context does not explicitly mention the specific format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the input layer has 4200 dimensions of spectral reflectance data. Spectral reflectance data typically refers to measurements of light reflected from a surface across different wavelengths or bands. This type of data can be represented in various formats such as numerical arrays or matrices, often stored in file formats like CSV, Excel, or HDF5. Therefore, we can infer that the input data format used in this deep learning pipeline is likely to be a structured numerical dataset, possibly in a CSV or similar format.
