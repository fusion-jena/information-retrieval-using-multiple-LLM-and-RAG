The text does not explicitly state the method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. However, it mentions that the hyperparameters of minimum distance and the number of neighbors were fixed at 0.005 and 15, respectively, during the UMAP runs. This suggests that no optimization technique like grid search or random search was employed in this particular study. Instead, the authors chose to maintain these hyperparameters at fixed levels. Nevertheless, they acknowledge the need for further investigation into how hyperparameter calibration might affect the model's performance.
