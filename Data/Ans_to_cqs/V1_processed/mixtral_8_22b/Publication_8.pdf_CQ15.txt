The text does not provide explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the model was trained until convergence, which suggests that some form of gradient descent optimization algorithm was likely employed. Common optimization algorithms used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), and others. Without further details, it cannot be determined which specific optimization technique was utilized in this case.
