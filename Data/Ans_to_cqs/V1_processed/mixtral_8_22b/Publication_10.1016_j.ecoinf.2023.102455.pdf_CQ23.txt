The paper does not explicitly state any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it can be inferred from the information given that some form of normalization was applied to prevent cumulative errors caused by the multiscale decomposition of the decomposed signals and improve convergence. This normalization process involved scaling the input and target parameters between 0 and 1 using the following equation:

Xnorm = X - Xmin / Xmax - Xmin

This normalization technique helps to reduce overfitting and improves the ability of the model to generalize well on unseen data. Additionally, the use of different hyperparameters for training and testing phases suggests that some form of validation was performed during the development of the model. However, without explicit details about the validation method used, it cannot be confirmed if this was done through techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting.
