Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific methods are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer some possible methods based on the information available.

For instance, the study mentions that all values of their dataset were extracted from digital maps using the Geographic Information System (GIS) program (ArcGIS 10.1; ESRI). This suggests that one method for collecting raw data could be through the use of GIS software and digital maps. Additionally, the study includes both geographical and meteorological variables, which may indicate that data was collected from various sources such as satellite imagery or weather stations.

Furthermore, the study references several other papers that discuss pest monitoring and forecasting, which may suggest that data collection methods such as field surveys or sensor networks could also be relevant in this context. However, without more explicit information about the specific data collection methods used in this particular study, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
