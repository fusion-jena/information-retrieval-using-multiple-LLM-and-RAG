In the given context, one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This technique involves turning off a certain percentage of neurons during each training iteration, effectively reducing the complexity of the model and preventing co-adaptations among neurons. In the context, it is stated that "Dropout refers to the number of neurons randomly turned off during each training inference." However, no explicit mention of other regularization methods like L2 regularization is made in the provided text.
