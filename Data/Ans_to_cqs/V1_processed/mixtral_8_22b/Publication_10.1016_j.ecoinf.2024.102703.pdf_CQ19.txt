The text does not provide information about which specific framework or library was used to build the deep learning model. However, it mentions that MATLAB R2014b was used to create a three-layer backpropagation (BP) artificial neural network. Therefore, we can infer that MATLAB was the primary tool employed to develop this particular deep learning model.

MATLAB is a high-level programming language and numerical computing environment widely used for scientific computing, data analysis, algorithm development, modeling, simulation, image processing, and more. It provides built-in functions and toolboxes for machine learning and deep learning tasks, including support for creating and training neural networks like the one described in the given context.
