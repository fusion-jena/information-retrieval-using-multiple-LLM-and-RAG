The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that 8330 cells (half of the total) were randomly extracted as a mask for training data and 3,332 cells (20% of the total) were randomly extracted as a mask for validation data. This suggests that some form of validation was performed during the training process. Typically, in machine learning models like the U-Net model mentioned here, common criteria to determine when training is complete include observing a plateau in the validation loss, achieving a predefined level of performance on the validation set, or reaching a maximum number of training epochs. Without more specific details, it cannot be definitively stated what exact criteria were used in this particular case.
