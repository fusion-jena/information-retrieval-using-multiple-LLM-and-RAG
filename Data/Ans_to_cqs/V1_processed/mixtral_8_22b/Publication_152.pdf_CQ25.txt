The purpose of the deep learning model used in this work is for image segmentation. Specifically, it aims to identify Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species for the Brazilian natural flora, using U-Net architecture. This is based on positive results by U-Net to identify a variety of objects and plant species. The goal is to achieve accurate and fine-grained segmentation of plants from high-resolution UAV imagery.
