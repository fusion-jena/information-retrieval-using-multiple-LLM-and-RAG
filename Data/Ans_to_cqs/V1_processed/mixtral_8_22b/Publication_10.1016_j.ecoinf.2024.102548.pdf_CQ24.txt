Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention or explanation regarding how the authors handled randomness in their deep learning pipeline, including the use of random seeds, in the given context. Therefore, it would be speculative to provide any specific strategies they might have employed without further information. However, some common practices to manage randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting fixed random seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average predictions across multiple runs, and applying cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance on various dataset splits.
