The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is object detection, specifically for detecting wild birds in camera trap images. The researchers aimed to evaluate the performance of eight deep learning algorithms for bird object detection using a dataset of 9717 images of 15 wild bird species from China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. Their goal was to determine if deep learning-based approaches could efficiently detect wild birds in camera traps, reducing manual processing costs and enabling more efficient monitoring of wildlife populations across large areas and over time. Ultimately, the findings of this research can assist conservation practitioners in selecting suitable models for their detection tasks and provide insights into the application of deep learning-based technologies for improving wildlife monitoring and environmental protection.
