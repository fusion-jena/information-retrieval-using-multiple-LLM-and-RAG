The provided context does not directly address the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss the importance of data preparation for machine learning models, specifically focusing on Species Distribution Models (SDMs). It mentions the use of bootstrapping, a type of resampling technique, to improve the precision of models by reducing stochastic errors in estimation. This could be considered a form of data preprocessing, although it is not one of the standard methods typically associated with deep learning models. In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalizing input features to a similar scale, handling missing values or outliers, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets. These steps help ensure that the model can learn effectively from the data and generalize well to new, unseen examples.
