The study uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that was originally developed and trained using millions of labeled images in over 1000 categories from the ImageNet database. However, it is important to note that this specific study does not use any of those original datasets directly. Instead, it applies the pre-trained ResNet-50 model to extract features from spectrogram images generated from audio recordings of boatwhistle sounds made by male Atlantic croaker fish. These spectrogram images serve as the primary dataset for this particular study.
