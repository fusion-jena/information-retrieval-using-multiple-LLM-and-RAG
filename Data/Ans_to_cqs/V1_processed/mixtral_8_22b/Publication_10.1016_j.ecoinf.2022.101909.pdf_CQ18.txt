During the training phase, the authors employed a strategy to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal training of their model. They proposed 50 training epochs and utilized the early stopping method with patience set to 5. Early stopping is a form of regularization used to stop training when a monitored metric has stopped improving. By setting the patience parameter to 5, they ensured that if there was no improvement in the monitored metric after five consecutive epochs, the training would be halted. This approach helped achieve optimal training at the end of the ninth epoch, where the maximum loss reached approximately 3 for the training subset and around 4.5 Ã— 10^(-4) for the validation subset.
