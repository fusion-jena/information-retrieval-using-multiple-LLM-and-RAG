The provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions various machine learning methods like random forests, support vector machines, feature fusion techniques, and neural networks being used for establishing Aboveground Biomass (AGB) equations. These methods could potentially incorporate techniques to handle data bias, but the context does not provide explicit information about them.

Techniques commonly used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling increases the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide range of examples representing different scenarios, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving model generalization.

In summary, although the given context does not explicitly mention techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, common approaches include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
