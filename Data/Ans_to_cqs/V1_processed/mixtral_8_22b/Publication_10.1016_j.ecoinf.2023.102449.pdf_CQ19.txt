Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state which specific deep learning framework was used to build the described model. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular choices for building deep learning models, but without explicit mention or relevant keywords related to these frameworks, it cannot be definitively determined which one was used. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, I do not have enough information to accurately determine which framework was utilized.
