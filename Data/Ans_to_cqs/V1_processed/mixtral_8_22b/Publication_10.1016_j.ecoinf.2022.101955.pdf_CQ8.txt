The given context does not provide any information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only discusses various research papers related to remote sensing, geographical mapping, and machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and random forests. However, it does not mention anything about the availability or location of the code repository for these pipelines. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on this context alone.
