The context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, generally speaking, there are several ways to collect raw data for deep learning applications. These include using surveys or questionnaires to gather human input, deploying various types of sensors to capture real-world data, and utilizing publicly available datasets. Surveys and questionnaires can be useful when working with subjective data, such as opinions or preferences. On the other hand, sensors like cameras, microphones, temperature sensors, or GPS devices can help collect objective data related to images, sounds, environmental conditions, or location information. Lastly, many organizations and institutions offer open access to large datasets containing diverse types of information, which can save researchers significant time and resources.
