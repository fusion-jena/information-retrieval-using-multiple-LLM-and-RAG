The context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that species occurrence data can come from citizen science initiatives and environmental layers for modeling them. Citizen science initiatives often involve volunteers who collect data through various means such as observations, surveys, or sensor readings. Environmental layers refer to geospatial data sets that describe aspects of the environment like climate, topography, land cover, etc. These data sets can be obtained from public repositories or generated by processing remote sensing imagery. Therefore, we can infer that the methods used for collecting raw data might include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. But without more specific context, this cannot be confirmed.
