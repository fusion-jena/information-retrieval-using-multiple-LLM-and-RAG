Unfortunately, there isn't any information about specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline within the provided context. However, based on general knowledge, some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, shearing, and brightness adjustment. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the robustness of the model.
