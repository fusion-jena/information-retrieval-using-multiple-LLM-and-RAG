The information provided does not explicitly state the specific format of the input data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, we can infer that the study primarily uses image data. Specifically, the datasets mentioned - ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM) - are all described as containing images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
