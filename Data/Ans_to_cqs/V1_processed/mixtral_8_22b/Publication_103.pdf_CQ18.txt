The context does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, based on standard machine learning practices, it can be inferred that the model performance might have been monitored through metrics such as loss or accuracy on validation datasets during each epoch of training. Additionally, techniques like early stopping could also have been employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
