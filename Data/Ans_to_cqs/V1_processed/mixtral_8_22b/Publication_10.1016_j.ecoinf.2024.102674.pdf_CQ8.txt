The given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text discusses various aspects such as fitting Random Forests (RFs) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) using specific packages in R, evaluating variable importance in Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and citing several scientific papers related to topics like microclimatic challenges in global change biology, optimizing input data for gridding climate normals, and downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography. However, there is no mention of any code repository or version control system used for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the provided context.
