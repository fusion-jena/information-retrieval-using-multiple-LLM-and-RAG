The text does not provide explicit information about specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Synthetic Spectral Databases created from Linear Spectral Mixing for developing RF-based classifiers and regression models tailored for Wildfire Severity Mapping (WSM). Additionally, it discusses the utility of deep learning in extracting complex patterns from High-Dimensional Sentinel-2 (S2) Satellite Imagery, which leads to improved accuracy in severity classifications. Therefore, while the exact dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the researchers have employed Synthetic Spectral Databases and High-Dimensional S2 Satellite Imagery within their deep learning pipeline.
