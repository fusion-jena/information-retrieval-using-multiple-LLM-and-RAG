The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used to evaluate deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the model in making accurate predictions or classifications based on input data. Without further information, it is impossible to determine which specific metrics were used in this case.

Based on the given context, we can infer that the authors might have used some form of metric to evaluate their deep learning model's performance. Still, without explicit details about these metrics, we cannot provide a definitive answer. It would be best to refer directly to the original paper or contact the authors for more precise information regarding the evaluation metrics employed in their study.
