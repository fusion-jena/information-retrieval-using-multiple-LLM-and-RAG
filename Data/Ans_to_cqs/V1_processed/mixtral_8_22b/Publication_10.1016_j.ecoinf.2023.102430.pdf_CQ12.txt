The study uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network called AlexNet (AN) as part of its machine learning pipeline. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model commonly used for image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. In this case, AN is employed to help automate the identification of Chagas disease vectors by analyzing pictures of triatomine bugs captured with ordinary cellphone cameras. The goal is to improve entomological surveillance systems in Latin America by providing accurate and efficient taxonomic support through a combination of human expertise and AI-powered analysis.
