Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that one possible criterion could be reaching a certain level of accuracy during the training process. In this case, the proposed CNN-LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 95.06%, which was higher than the previously reported accuracy of 91%. Additionally, the training process took around 10 hours on the CPU and reached this accuracy after 140 epochs. These details suggest that the training may have been considered complete once the desired level of accuracy was achieved or after a certain number of epochs had been completed. Other common criteria for determining when training is complete include observing a plateau in the validation loss or a decrease in the learning rate. However, without more information, it cannot be definitively stated what specific criteria were used in this particular study.
