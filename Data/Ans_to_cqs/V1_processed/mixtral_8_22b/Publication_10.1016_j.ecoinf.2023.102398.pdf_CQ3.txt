Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have utilized bounding box annotations for their deep learning pipeline. This is evident from Figure 13, where the output shows the bounding boxes around the objects along with their respective class names. However, there is no explicit mention or evidence of other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation being employed in this study. Therefore, we can only confirm that bounding box annotation was used in this particular case.
