Based on the given context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline discussed here involves images as its primary data format. This is evident from several mentions of images throughout the text, including phrases like "image size," "larger image," and references to networks being used for tasks such as microorganism classification and Cervidae classification - both of which typically involve visual data. However, the context does not provide explicit details about other potential data formats used in this specific deep learning pipeline, such as audio, video, or structured data in formats like CSV.
