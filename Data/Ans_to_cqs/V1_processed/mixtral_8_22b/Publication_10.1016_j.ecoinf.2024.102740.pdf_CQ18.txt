During the machine learning training process using Random Forest (RF), an unbiased internal estimate of the generalization error is generated through the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples. These OOB samples are those not included in the training subset. In this particular case, the total number of samples used for validation is eight. The system for automated geoscientific analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0) was utilized to carry out classification employing the RF technique, based on Red Green Blue (RGB) images captured in March, April, and May. To optimize the hyperparameters of the RF algorithm, the maximum shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100, and the minimum sample number from 1 to 50. Ultimately, the most precise results for RF were achieved when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. This approach allows for continuous monitoring of the model's performance during training, ensuring optimal accuracy and reliability.
