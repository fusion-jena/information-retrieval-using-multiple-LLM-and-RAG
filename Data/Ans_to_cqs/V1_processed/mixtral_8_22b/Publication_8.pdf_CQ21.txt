After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be taken to further analyze and improve the results. Based on the given context, one such step involves evaluating the performance of the model using metrics like average precision. To calculate this metric, some of the unannotated scans were manually annotated based on the predicted bounding boxes generated by the model. This process helped in reducing the time required for manual annotation significantly.

Additionally, another important postprocessing step mentioned in the context is the use of transfer learning to initialize the model weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Transfer learning helps in reducing the training time and improves the overall performance of the model, especially when dealing with smaller datasets. By leveraging the knowledge gained from pre-training on large datasets, the model can quickly adapt to new tasks or domains.

However, it should be noted that the context does not explicitly mention any other specific postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. These methods could still potentially be useful for analyzing the model's performance and identifying areas for improvement. Saliency maps, for instance, can help visualize which parts of the input images contribute most towards the final prediction made by the model. On the other hand, confusion matrices provide a summary of the classification accuracy, including false positives and negatives, allowing for better understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.
