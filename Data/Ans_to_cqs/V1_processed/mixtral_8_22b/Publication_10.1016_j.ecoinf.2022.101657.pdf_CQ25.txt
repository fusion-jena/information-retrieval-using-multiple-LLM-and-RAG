The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the provided context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model is likely designed for image classification tasks, particularly for identifying specific species of animals captured in camera trap images. This is suggested by the mention of training the network for a bespoke set of species prevalent in the region where the camera trap is deployed (section 7.1.3). Additionally, the reference to using a combination of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation (Schindler and Steinhage, 2021) implies that the model might also involve instance segmentation for better identification of animal species in video clips (section 7.1.4). Therefore, while the exact purpose of the deep learning model is not specified, it appears to focus on classifying and potentially segmenting animal species in camera trap images and videos.
