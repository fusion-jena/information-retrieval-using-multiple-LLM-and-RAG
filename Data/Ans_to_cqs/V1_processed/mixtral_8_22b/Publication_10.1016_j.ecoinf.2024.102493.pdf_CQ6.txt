The paper does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. However, it does describe some general preprocessing steps applied to their datasets. These include proportional scaling, projection transformations, and mask extraction based on watershed boundaries. In terms of proportional scaling, they divided each pixel's original value by a scale factor of 10,000. For projection transformations, they utilized the WGS1984-Albers projected coordinate system. Mask extraction was performed based on watershed boundaries extracted from the ArcGIS Pro 3.0.2 hydrological analysis toolbox. While these steps may be relevant to preparing data for a deep learning model, they do not directly address common preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, without additional information, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps specifically tailored for training a deep learning model in this context.
