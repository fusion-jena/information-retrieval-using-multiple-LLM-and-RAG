Based on the given context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the context mentions that ResNet-50 processes three-band (RGB) input images with a size of 224 x 224 pixels. Additionally, the context discusses the use of training images and their classification into different classes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this particular deep learning pipeline is images.
