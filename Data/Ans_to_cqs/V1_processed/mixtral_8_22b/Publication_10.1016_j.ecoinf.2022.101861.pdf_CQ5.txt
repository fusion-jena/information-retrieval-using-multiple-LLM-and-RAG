The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, it is implied that the authors used large acoustic datasets for their analysis. They utilized Kaleidoscope Pro 5.4.7, an automated signal recognition software capable of analyzing such datasets. This software extracts sounds of interest based on specific parameters like minimum and maximum signal length, minimum and maximum frequency range, and maximum intersyllable gap. For identifying representative parameters of the Nighthawk's song, the authors characterized 67 songs using recordings uploaded in Xeno-canto and recorded in the State of Mato Grosso. Therefore, while the exact name or source of the dataset isn't specified, it appears that the researchers employed a custom dataset comprising audio recordings of bird vocalizations.
