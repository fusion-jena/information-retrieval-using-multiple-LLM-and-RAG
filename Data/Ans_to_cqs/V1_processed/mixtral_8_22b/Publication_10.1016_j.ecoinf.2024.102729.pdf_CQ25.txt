The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the given context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the references provided, it appears that the deep learning model may be used for various applications related to water quality management. For instance, the paper titled "Applications of deep learning in water quality management" suggests that deep learning models could potentially be applied for tasks such as prediction, monitoring, or analysis of water quality parameters like pH levels, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, etc. Another reference mentions using machine learning techniques, including deep learning, for analyzing spatial and temporal variation in water coverage in lakes. Therefore, without further specific details about the particular deep learning model being discussed, it can only be speculated that its purpose might involve some aspect of water quality management or analysis.
