The given context does not provide explicit details about specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the authors are using a deep learning approach to extract information from images, specifically focusing on forest characteristics. They use a combination of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for their analysis.

The process involves sampling batches of reference data patches of size 15x15 pixels, considering only those patches where the central pixel is forested. This implies that some form of labeling or annotation might be involved to identify which pixels correspond to forests. However, the exact technique used for this purpose is not mentioned in the provided context.

For each reference data patch, they select corresponding optical and SAR images. While this doesn't directly relate to traditional data annotation techniques like bounding boxes or instance segmentation, it suggests a form of data association or alignment between different types of images.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it does suggest that some form of labeling or annotation is being used to identify forested areas in the images.
