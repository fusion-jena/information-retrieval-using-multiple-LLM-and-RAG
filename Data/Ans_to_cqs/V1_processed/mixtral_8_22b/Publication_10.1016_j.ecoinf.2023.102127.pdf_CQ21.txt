The text does not provide explicit information about specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, confusion matrices, or metric calculations. However, it mentions that after specifying an engine and training the model, the resulting fit can be visually interrogated, summarized, and validated. Visual interrogation might involve techniques similar to saliency maps, which help understand what features contribute most to the predictions made by the model. Summarization could refer to calculating various metrics to evaluate the model's performance, while validation may entail using techniques like confusion matrices to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions.
