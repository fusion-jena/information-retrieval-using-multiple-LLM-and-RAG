Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does state that the input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. Additionally, since the dataset was balanced, both networks were trained with a learning rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by Adam optimizer. Various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming and brightness changes were also applied. These methods could potentially help mitigate some forms of data bias but they do not directly address issues like class imbalance or lack of diversity in the dataset. Therefore, without further context, it cannot be determined what specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
