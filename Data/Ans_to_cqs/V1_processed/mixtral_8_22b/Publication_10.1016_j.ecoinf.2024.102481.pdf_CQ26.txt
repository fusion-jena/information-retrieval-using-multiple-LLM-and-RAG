There are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in each set. This ensures that the model is trained and tested on representative samples of the entire dataset.

Oversampling is a technique used when there is a significant imbalance between classes in the dataset. It involves duplicating examples from the minority class until it reaches a similar number as the majority class. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling is another technique used to handle class imbalance. It involves removing examples from the majority class until it reaches a similar number as the minority class. However, this method can result in loss of information if too many examples are removed.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real world. This can help reduce bias caused by overrepresentation of certain groups or underrepresentation of others.

In addition to these techniques, regularization methods such as dropout and weight decay can also be used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping can also be used to increase the amount of available data and improve model robustness.

Overall, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is crucial for building accurate and reliable models. By employing appropriate techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, we can mitigate the impact of bias and build more equitable AI systems.
