The authors do not explicitly mention any specific strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to random seed values. However, they discuss employing a simple augmentation strategy during the training stage, which involves randomly cropping square patches of various sizes and applying horizontal and vertical flips with a 50% probability. This could potentially introduce some level of randomness into the training process. During the validation phase, they use regularly spaced, overlapping patches of the same size employed during training, ensuring consistency between the two stages. Nonetheless, it should be noted that handling randomness due to random seed values might involve setting fixed seeds or using techniques like ensemble methods, but these aspects are not discussed in the given context.
