The text does not provide explicit information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss function for supervising TrunkNet's training. While not explicitly stated, using a loss function like BCE could potentially help mitigate overfitting by providing a measure of how well the network is generalizing to unseen data during training. Additionally, the use of dilated convolutions might also contribute to reducing overfitting by allowing the network to capture larger context without increasing the number of parameters or computational complexity. Nevertheless, without specific mention of techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization, it cannot be definitively confirmed if these were utilized in the described methodology.
