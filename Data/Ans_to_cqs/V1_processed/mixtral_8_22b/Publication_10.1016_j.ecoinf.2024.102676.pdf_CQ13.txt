The text does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that no hyperparameter tuning was conducted and that all models were executed with the default FIT parameters. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hyperparameters were used based on the given context.
