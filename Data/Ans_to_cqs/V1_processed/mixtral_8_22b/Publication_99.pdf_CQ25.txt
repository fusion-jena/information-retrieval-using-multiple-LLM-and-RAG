Based on the given information, there are three types of deep learning models mentioned: PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and Classification networks.

PConv networks are likely used for image completion or inpainting tasks, as they involve filling missing regions in images. They use a combination of losses like per-pixel loss, perceptual loss, style loss, and total variation loss. These losses help in generating realistic and coherent content in the filled regions.

Pix2Pix networks are typically employed for image-to-image translation tasks. They can transform an input image into another form, such as converting sketches to photographs or daytime images to nighttime images. They utilize adversarial loss and L1 loss during training.

Classification networks are designed to classify images into specific categories. In this case, they are used for plant species identification tasks. A pre-trained VGG16 network is adapted for this purpose, replacing its fully connected layers with global max-pooling, dropout, and a single hidden layer. Cross-entropy loss is used as the optimization objective.

In summary, the purpose of these deep learning models varies depending on their type. PConv networks focus on image completion, Pix2Pix networks handle image-to-image translation, and Classification networks aim to categorize images accurately.
