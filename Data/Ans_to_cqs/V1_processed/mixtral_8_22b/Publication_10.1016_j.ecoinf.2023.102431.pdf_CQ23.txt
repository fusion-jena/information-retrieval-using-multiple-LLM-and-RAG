The authors have not explicitly mentioned any specific techniques such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models. However, they did use a stepwise variable selection procedure with a p-value serving as the decisive factor to select the variables that had the best discriminating power based on their F-ratios. They also used linear discriminant analysis to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane depending on the number of variables in the resulting model to classify species or sex. Additionally, they evaluated the dataset for potential biases, including foot position bias and observer bias, by recording the foot position of each track during the feature extraction process and having three different observers manually mark the landmark points in the FIT interface. Outliers were identified and removed from the dataset for subsequent analyses. These steps may contribute to improving the robustness and generalizability of the models, but explicit mention of common methods like cross-validation or stratified sampling is missing.
