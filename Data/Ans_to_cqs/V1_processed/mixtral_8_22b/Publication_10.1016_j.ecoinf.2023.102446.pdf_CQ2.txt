The information provided does not specify the type of data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data for all variables. This suggests that the data could be in a time series or numerical format, possibly stored in a CSV file or similar structured format. Without further details on the specific deep learning pipeline used in the research, I cannot determine the exact data format employed.
