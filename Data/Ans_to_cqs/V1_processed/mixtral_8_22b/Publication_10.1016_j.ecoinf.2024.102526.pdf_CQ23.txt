The information provided does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, some aspects can be inferred from the given context. For instance, the planned spatial and temporal extents suggest that the study covers a diverse range of locations and time periods, which could contribute to a more generalizable dataset. The use of multiple cameras and different light spectra also indicates potential variability in the collected images. Additionally, the study aims to measure both primary and secondary data, possibly leading to a comprehensive dataset. Nevertheless, without explicit details about the deep learning model used, it is impossible to definitively state the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.
