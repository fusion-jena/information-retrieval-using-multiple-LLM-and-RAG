Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, and validation. However, it's common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a certain percentage of the dataset for training, another portion for validating the model during training, and a final part for testing the performance of the trained model. This process helps prevent overfitting and ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Typically, the data is randomly divided into these subsets, but sometimes stratified sampling may be employed to maintain similar distributions across classes in each subset.
