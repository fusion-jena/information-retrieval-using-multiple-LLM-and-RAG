Based on the given context, it can be inferred that various types of data formats have been utilized in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in these studies. However, the majority of them focus on visual data such as images or videos. For instance, Durve et al. (2022) use YOLOv5 and DeepSORT for microfluidic applications, while Palmer (n.d.) employs deep learning for high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings. Similarly, Qin et al. (2022) propose a fish detection method based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images. Furthermore, Rani et al. (2024) present a novel automated approach for fish biomass estimation in turbid environments through deep learning, object detection, and regression. Lastly, Zhang et al. (2024) introduce a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural networks. These examples suggest that images and videos are commonly used data formats in the deep learning pipelines discussed in this context.
