The provided context does not directly address the specific issue of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing the impact of different random seed values. However, it does discuss some general strategies related to improving the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models like MaxEnt ENM. These include combining data from multiple sources, such as FAIR repositories and citizen science data, to reduce sampling bias and improve the estimation of biodiversity trends. Additionally, the use of MaxEnt ENM itself is noted for its ability to achieve high prediction accuracy due to its design and constraints. Nonetheless, without explicit information regarding the management of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it cannot be definitively stated what strategies are employed based solely on these references.
