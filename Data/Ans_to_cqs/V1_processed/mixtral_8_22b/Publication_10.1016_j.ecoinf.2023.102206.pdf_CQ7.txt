The context does not provide explicit details about how the data was split for deep learning model training. However, we can infer that the data was divided into training and testing sets. According to Table 4, input parameters such as CO2 emissions due to gaseous, liquid, and solid fuel consumption were considered for the analysis. These features might be used to train the deep learning models. Furthermore, the text mentions that benchmark datasets are investigated for ML methodologies where training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. This suggests that the data could have been randomly split into training and testing sets, maintaining the same distribution. Additionally, the context discusses the use of transfer learning, which involves utilizing previously learned information to solve new related tasks. This implies that there might be separate source and target domains, possibly requiring further splitting of the data. Nonetheless, specific criteria for splitting the data, such as percentage allocations for train, test, and validation sets, are not mentioned in the given context.
