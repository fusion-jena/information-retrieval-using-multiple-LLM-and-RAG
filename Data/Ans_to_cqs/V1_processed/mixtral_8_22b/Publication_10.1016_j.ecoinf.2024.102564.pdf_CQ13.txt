In the given context, two machine learning models are discussed - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forests (RFs). However, there isn't explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used for these models, such as learning rates or optimizers, which are typically associated with deep learning models.

For the ANN model, it is mentioned that the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture was used, with one hidden layer. The number of neurons in this layer was determined using the Fletcher-Gloss method. Activation functions were also tested but not specified. There is no mention of any other hyperparameters like learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc., which are commonly used in deep learning models.

As for the RF model, three main parameters were configured during its training: the number of random regression trees (ntree), the number of division variables (mtry), and the minimum size of nodes (node size). These are typical hyperparameters for RF models, but again, they do not include those usually associated with deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, as the discussion primarily revolves around ANNs and RFs, without delving into the specifics of deep learning model configurations.
