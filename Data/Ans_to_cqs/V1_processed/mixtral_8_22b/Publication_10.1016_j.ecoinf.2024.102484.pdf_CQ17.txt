Based on the given context, it appears there is no direct information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in this study. However, I can provide some general insights into common regularization techniques used in deep learning models.

Regularization methods are employed to prevent overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training dataset too well, capturing noise along with underlying patterns, which leads to poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization helps to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization, making the model more generalizable.

Two commonly used regularization methods in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization (also known as weight decay):

1. Dropout: This technique randomly sets a fraction of input or hidden units to zero during each iteration of training. By doing so, dropout prevents complex co-adaptations between neurons, reducing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize.

2. L2 regularization: Also known as weight decay, L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit.

These regularization methods have been widely adopted in various deep learning applications, including image classification, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. While the context does not explicitly mention their usage in this particular study, these techniques remain essential tools for preventing overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
