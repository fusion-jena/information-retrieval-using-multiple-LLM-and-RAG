The text does not explicitly mention specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it mentions that the model was trained with hand-annotated data and that data augmentation techniques were employed. Additionally, it refers to ImageNet mean normalization, suggesting that the model might have been initialized with ImageNet pre-trained weights. Furthermore, the text discusses the potential application of features learned from high-resolution data to lower resolution satellite data or even higher resolution UAV data. This implies that the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline likely consist of high-resolution airborne imagery, possibly including NEON sites, which were used for both pretraining and fine-tuning the model.
