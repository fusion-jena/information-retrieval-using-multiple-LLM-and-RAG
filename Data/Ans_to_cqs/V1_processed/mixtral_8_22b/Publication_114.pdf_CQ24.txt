Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, one strategy that can be inferred from the context is data augmentation. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to existing samples. By doing so, the dataset becomes more diverse, which helps reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. Additionally, using different subsets of the available data for training and validation can help mitigate the effects of random initialization and provide a better estimate of the model's true performance.
