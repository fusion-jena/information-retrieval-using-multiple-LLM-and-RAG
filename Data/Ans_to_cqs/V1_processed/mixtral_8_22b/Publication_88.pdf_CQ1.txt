The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific methods or sources used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data might have been collected through remote sensing techniques, given the focus on deforestation detection and the use of satellite imagery. Remote sensing involves obtaining information about the Earth's surface and atmosphere using sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites. This method allows for large-scale data collection over vast geographical areas, making it suitable for monitoring changes such as deforestation. Additionally, the tables indicate that the dataset consists of multiple tiles, suggesting that the data may have been obtained from various locations or time periods.
