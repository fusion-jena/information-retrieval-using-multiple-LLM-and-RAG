The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that techniques like padding short audio clips with zeros or using the entire length of the clip when dealing with sounds shorter than 3 seconds could help mitigate potential issues caused by randomness. These methods ensure consistency in the input size, which might indirectly address concerns related to variability introduced by random seeds. Nonetheless, directly addressing the management of random seed values requires specific knowledge beyond what is presented in the provided context.
