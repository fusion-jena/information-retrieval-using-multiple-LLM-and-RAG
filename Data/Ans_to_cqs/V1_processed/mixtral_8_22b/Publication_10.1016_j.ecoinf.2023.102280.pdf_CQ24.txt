Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically regarding random seed values. However, some common practices in handling randomness include setting fixed seeds for reproducibility, using ensemble methods to average out results across different initializations, and employing deterministic algorithms where possible. In the case of generating training data for fine-tuning, the context mentions collecting clean data and superimposing noise profiles to create both input data and a 'denoised' ground truth. Random sampling of noise from a dataset is mentioned, but specific strategies to manage randomness in this process aren't discussed.
