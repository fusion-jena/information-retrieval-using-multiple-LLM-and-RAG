The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This can be seen in several places throughout the text. Firstly, the term 'CNN' is explicitly mentioned in the first paragraph. Secondly, the architecture of the model is described in detail in the Appendix section, where it states that the model uses convolutional layers. These layers apply a set of parameterized kernels by convolving them across their inputs, which is a characteristic operation of CNNs. Furthermore, the model is designed to go beyond traditional independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) models of sequence evolution and capture k-mer signatures, which aligns with the capabilities of CNNs in pattern recognition tasks.
