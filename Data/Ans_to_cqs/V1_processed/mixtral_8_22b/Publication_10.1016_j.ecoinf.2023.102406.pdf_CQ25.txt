The text does not explicitly mention the purpose of any deep learning model. However, it discusses various aspects of modeling, including selecting classifiers such as MaxEnt and Random Forests, which can be used for tasks like classification and regression. In this context, the purpose of these models could be to predict species distributions based on environmental factors. Additionally, the text mentions using resampling techniques and parameter tuning to improve model performance, further suggesting that the goal might be to create accurate predictive models.
