Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the proposed deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, considering the application of the framework in classifying water contamination levels in aquaculture, it is likely that the data collected through IoT devices would be numerical values or sensor readings. These could include measurements like temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration, which are typically represented in tabular form, such as CSV files. The use of other data formats like images, audio, or video does not seem relevant to this specific application.
