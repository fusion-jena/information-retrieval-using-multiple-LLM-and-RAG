Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions details about the training process, such as the use of Tesla T4 GPU, CUDA version 12.0, input image size, batch size, epochs, weights, data, and cache settings. However, it does not specify any links or references to the actual code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given context.
