Unfortunately, there isn't any specific mention of data augmentation techniques applied in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned here. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, zooming, and adding noise. These techniques help improve the generalizability and robustness of the trained models by artificially increasing the amount of training data available.
