The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the concept of bagging, also known as bootstrap aggregating, which is a technique used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by reducing their variance. Bagging involves creating multiple instances of a predictor and combining them to produce improved results. In the case of decision trees, this means building multiple trees on different subsets of the data and averaging their outputs. While this approach does not directly address data bias, it can help mitigate its effects by reducing the impact of outliers and improving overall model stability. Additionally, the text mentions the use of random forests, which is another ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to produce more accurate predictions. Random forests work by selecting a random subset of features at each candidate split during the learning process, which helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization. Again, while this technique does not specifically target data bias, it can indirectly contribute to addressing it by producing more robust and reliable models.
