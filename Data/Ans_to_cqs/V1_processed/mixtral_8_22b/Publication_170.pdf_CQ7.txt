Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated how the data was divided into different subsets such as training, testing, or validation datasets. However, it is mentioned that the same test set (Test) was used to evaluate the performance of models in different training phases. This implies that there might have been separate training and testing datasets. Additionally, the table shows seven incremental training sets with increasing numbers of images, but no specific details are provided regarding their division criteria. Therefore, without further context, it cannot be determined what exact criteria were used to split the data for deep learning model training.
