The text does not provide specific details about the exact data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset training and overcome network overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the diversity of the dataset without actually collecting new data, thus improving the generalization ability of the model.
