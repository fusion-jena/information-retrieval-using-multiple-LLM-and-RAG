The code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study can be found here: https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf. This repository contains an already trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ using the COCO dataset, which was used in this research to extract common objects below the skyline in landscape photos. The authors did not retrain the model on their own data but instead used it as is to infer the presence of these objects in their images.
