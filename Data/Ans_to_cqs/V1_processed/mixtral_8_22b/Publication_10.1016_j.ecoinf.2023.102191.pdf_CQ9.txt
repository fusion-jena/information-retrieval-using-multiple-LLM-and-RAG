The article does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the use of Dive Reporter, a mobile application designed to collect biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers. However, it does not mention any specific repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the collected data might be stored. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available based on the given context.
