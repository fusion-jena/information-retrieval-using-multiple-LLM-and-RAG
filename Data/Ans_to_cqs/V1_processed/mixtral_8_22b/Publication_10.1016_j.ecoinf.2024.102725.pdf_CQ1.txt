The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing techniques are employed to gather data related to vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These techniques typically involve using satellite or airborne sensors to capture images of Earth's surface, which can then be processed to extract information about vegetation health, coverage, and other relevant parameters. Some examples of these sensors include MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Sentinel-2 satellites. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology for generating synthetic optical images, suggesting that radar data may also be collected as part of the process. Publicly available datasets, such as those derived from satellite imagery, could potentially serve as sources of raw data for this application.
