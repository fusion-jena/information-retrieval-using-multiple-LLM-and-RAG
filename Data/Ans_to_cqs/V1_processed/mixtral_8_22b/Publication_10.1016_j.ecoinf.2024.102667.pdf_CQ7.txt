Based on the given context, there isn't any direct mention or discussion about splitting the data for deep learning model training such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to divide the available data into these three sets. Typically, the data is divided randomly with a ratio of around 70% for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training, evaluate its performance using the test set, and fine-tune hyperparameters using the validation set. Please note that this is not specific to the given context but rather general knowledge regarding data partitioning in machine learning and deep learning models.
