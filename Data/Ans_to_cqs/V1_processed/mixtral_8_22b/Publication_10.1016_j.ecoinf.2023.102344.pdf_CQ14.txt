The text does not provide explicit details on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the optimization algorithm used for training the model was stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). This suggests that some form of gradient-based optimization was employed. Unfortunately, without more specific information about the use of techniques such as grid search or random search, we cannot definitively state how the hyperparameters were optimized.
