To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, two main metrics were used: the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Coefficient of Determination (R2). The RMSE is a measure of how well the predicted values match the observed values, while the R2 indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. These metrics were used to compare the performance of the models on the training, validation, and test datasets. Overfitting was assessed by comparing the performance of the models on these three datasets. The goal was to achieve lower RMSE and higher R2 scores, indicating better model predictions.
