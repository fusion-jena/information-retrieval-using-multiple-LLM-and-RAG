A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the pipeline. This can be seen in several places throughout the given text. Firstly, it mentions that the network is designed with four convolution kernel pooling layers to extract deep features. Secondly, when discussing the classic CNN model, it states that the three features of F1, F2, and F3 are input into the CNN model. Lastly, the table titled 'Test accuracy (in %) of various features' shows the performance of the CNN model on different features. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that a CNN is being used in the pipeline.
