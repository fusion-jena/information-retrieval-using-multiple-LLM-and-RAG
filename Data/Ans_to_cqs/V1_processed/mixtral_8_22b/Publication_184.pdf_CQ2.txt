The provided context primarily discusses the application of deep learning for hyperspectral image classification and fish tracking using IEEE datasets. From this context, we can infer that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This includes both hyperspectral images and standard images containing fishes. The authors use these images to train their models, specifically the YOLOv3 model, for various purposes such as object detection and classification. Additionally, they mention the use of bounding box data, which is typically represented as coordinates within the image data itself. Therefore, based on the given context, the main data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are image data and bounding box data.
