The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly stated in the given context. However, it can be inferred from the text that the model is designed for bird sound noise reduction. Specifically, the model is referred to as a "bird sound noise reduction network" and is mentioned alongside other bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms such as SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA. Additionally, the model uses deep feature loss to train the network, which suggests that its goal is to minimize the difference between the processed bird sound signals and their corresponding clean versions. Therefore, while the exact purpose of the model is not directly specified, it appears to be intended for reducing noise in bird sounds, likely for applications related to ecology or conservation research.
