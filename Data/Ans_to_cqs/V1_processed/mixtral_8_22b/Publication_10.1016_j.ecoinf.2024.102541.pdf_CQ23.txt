The study aimed to develop a deep learning model that combined computational efficiency and real-time effectiveness across various datasets. To achieve this, the researchers used diverse datasets representing different domains, problems, species, and environmental conditions. By using these diverse datasets, they could thoroughly evaluate their model's performance and ensure its generalizability. Specifically, the model was evaluated for its ability to recognize endangered wildlife, fish species in markets, and complex objects in MS COCO 2017 scenes. The focus of the evaluation was on the model's lightweight, balanced accuracy-speed trade-off, and low computational demands, which are crucial for resource-limited settings. Additionally, the researchers compared YOLOv5s and WildARe-YOLO over 300 epochs on the MS COCO 2017 datasets, selecting results at intervals of 20 epochs, ranging from 0 to 299. They also included ground-truth annotations, with a histogram in the top-left showing class distribution and additional visualizations such as label, mask, and heat maps, offering comprehensive insights into the dataset's structure and diversity. However, it should be noted that the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
