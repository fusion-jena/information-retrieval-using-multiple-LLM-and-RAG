In the given context, the deep learning model uses an MLP architecture consisting of four layers, each containing 512 neurons and connected with residual connections. The model employs batch normalization and the ReLU activation function in all layers except the final one, where instead a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification. The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer. Both the weight decay and learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, a learning rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95 is employed, and dropout is introduced.
