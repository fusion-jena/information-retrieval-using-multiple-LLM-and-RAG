To monitor the model performance during training, a combination of grid search and cross-validation techniques were employed. Specifically, the regularization parameter ('C') and the kernel type (linear) of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model were calibrated using these techniques. Grid search was used to systematically explore different combinations of hyperparameter values, while cross-validation was applied to estimate how well the model would perform on unseen data. By combining these two strategies, it was possible to find the optimal set of hyperparameters that balanced model complexity and generalization ability, thus ensuring good performance both during training and when making predictions on new data.
