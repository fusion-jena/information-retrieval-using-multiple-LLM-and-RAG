The text does not provide information about the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained using TensorFlow2 and a GPU-cluster equipped with 4 RTX8000 GPUs. This suggests that the deployment might involve saving the trained model weights and using them in conjunction with TensorFlow2 on a similar hardware setup for inference purposes. But without explicit details regarding the deployment process, this remains speculative.
