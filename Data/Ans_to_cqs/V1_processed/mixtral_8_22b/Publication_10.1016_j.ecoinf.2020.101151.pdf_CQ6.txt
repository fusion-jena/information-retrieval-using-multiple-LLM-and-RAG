Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include:

1. Data Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries. In our case, we might want to ensure that all vegetation and human impact data is accurate and consistent across different grid cells.

2. Normalization/Standardization: Deep learning models often perform better when input features have similar scales. Techniques like Min-Max Scaling or Z-Score Standardization can help achieve this by transforming feature values into a common range or distribution. For instance, if we use the nine-cell approach mentioned earlier, we could apply these techniques to smooth out any discrepancies between neighboring cells.

3. Feature Engineering: Sometimes, creating new features from existing ones can enhance the predictive power of a model. However, given the limited information available about the specific problem domain, it's hard to provide concrete examples here.

4. Splitting Dataset: It's essential to split the dataset into separate sets for training, validation, and testing purposes. The training set helps the model learn patterns; the validation set allows us to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting; while the test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance.

5. Handling Class Imbalance: If certain classes dominate others in the target variable, it might lead to poor predictions for minority classes. Strategies like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights during training can mitigate this issue. Again, without knowing more details about the classification task, it's difficult to comment on whether this applies to our scenario.
