The paper does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some data sources such as nighttime lighting data, provincial statistical energy data, administrative boundary data, and various energy sources. These data could have been collected using different methods like remote sensing for nighttime lighting data, government databases or reports for statistical energy data, geospatial data providers for administrative boundary data, and possibly sensors or direct measurements for various energy sources. But without more specific details, we cannot definitively state which methods were used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
