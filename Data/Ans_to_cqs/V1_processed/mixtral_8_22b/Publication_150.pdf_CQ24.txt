The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions several strategies that can indirectly mitigate the effects of randomness. These include:

1. Data Augmentation: By applying various transformations like rotation, crop, shear, and horizontal flip, the model becomes exposed to different variations of the same image during training. This helps in reducing overfitting and improving the generalizability of the models.

2. Pretraining: Using models pre-trained on the ImageNet database before fine-tuning them for specific tasks reduces the impact of random initialization. Since the weights have already been learned from a vast dataset, they serve as a better starting point for further training.

3. Batch Normalization: This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, making the optimization landscape smoother and reducing the sensitivity to parameter initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, helping to prevent overfitting.

4. Learning Rate Schedule: Instead of keeping the learning rate constant throughout training, it is often beneficial to decrease it gradually. This approach, known as learning rate decay, can stabilize the training process and lead to better convergence.

While these techniques do not directly address the issue of controlling randomness due to factors like random seed values, they contribute to building robust and reliable deep learning pipelines.
