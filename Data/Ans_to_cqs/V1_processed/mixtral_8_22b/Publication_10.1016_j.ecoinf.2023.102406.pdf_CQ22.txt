The text mentions two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the classifier: the true positive rate (also known as sensitivity) and the true negative rate (also known as specificity). These metrics are used to assess how well the classifier assigns classes based on predictor variables. However, it should be noted that these terms are more commonly associated with binary classification tasks rather than deep learning specifically. In general, deep learning models can also be evaluated using other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., depending on the nature of the task and the desired evaluation criteria.
