The given context does not provide information on the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning (ML) methodologies with satellite data interpretation but does not specify whether it uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Transformers, or any other deep learning models. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
