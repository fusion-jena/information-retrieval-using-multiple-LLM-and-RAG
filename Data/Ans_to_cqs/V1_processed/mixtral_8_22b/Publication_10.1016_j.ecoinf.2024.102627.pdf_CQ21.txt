After the model has been trained and validated for predicting species assemblages, there are two main post-processing steps involved:

1. Removal of predictions outside the continents where species are known to occur: This step involves removing any predictions made by the model that fall outside the geographical areas where the observed species are known to exist according to the available data. This helps ensure that the model's predictions are accurate and relevant to the specific regions being studied.
2. Normalization of conditional probabilities associated with orchids: Once the irrelevant predictions have been removed, the next step is to normalize the conditional probabilities associated with orchids. This process ensures that the predicted probabilities accurately reflect the likelihood of observing different species within their respective habitats. More details about this step and the resulting maps can be found in Supplementary Information Box B.

In summary, the post-processing steps involve removing irrelevant predictions and normalizing the conditional probabilities associated with orchids to improve the accuracy and relevance of the model's predictions.
