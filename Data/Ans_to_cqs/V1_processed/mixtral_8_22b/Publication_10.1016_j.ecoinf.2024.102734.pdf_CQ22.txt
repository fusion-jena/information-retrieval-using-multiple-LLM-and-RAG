The text does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models. However, it does state that the model performance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using each of the three sample orderings. This suggests that some form of performance metric is being used to measure the effectiveness of the model. Additionally, the text mentions that the baseline accuracy is calculated using a 2-shot, 2-way test accuracy without fine-tuning (81.4%). This indicates that accuracy may be one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. Unfortunately, without more information, it is impossible to determine if other metrics such as precision or recall were also used.
