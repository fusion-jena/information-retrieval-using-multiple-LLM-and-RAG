Based on the given information, it does not explicitly state what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline. However, there is a reference to a paper titled "RCL: Recurrent Continuous Localization for Temporal Action Detection" by Wang et al. (2022). This suggests that the authors may have used a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a variant of it, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), in their work. Nevertheless, without more specific details about the pipeline mentioned in the context, we cannot definitively determine which type of deep learning model was employed.
