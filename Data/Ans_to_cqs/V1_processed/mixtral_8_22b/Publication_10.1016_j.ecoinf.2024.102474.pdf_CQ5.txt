The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned among the common datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is stated that the data used was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge and consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe. Therefore, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is likely related to Earth observation data from the EarthNet2021 Challenge.
