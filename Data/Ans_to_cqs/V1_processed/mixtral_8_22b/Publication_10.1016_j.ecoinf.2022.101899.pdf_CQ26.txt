The papers mentioned do not explicitly discuss specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a technique where the dataset is divided into subsets or strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then samples are drawn from each stratum to maintain the original distribution of classes in the dataset. This can help prevent any particular class from being overrepresented or underrepresented in the training set.

Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class to achieve the same goal. These techniques can be useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, but they should be applied carefully to avoid introducing additional biases.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and perspectives to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. This can involve gathering data from multiple locations, time periods, or demographics, depending on the problem domain.

It is important to note that addressing data bias requires careful consideration of the problem domain and potential sources of bias. Techniques such as those described above may need to be combined or adapted to suit the specific needs of the application.
