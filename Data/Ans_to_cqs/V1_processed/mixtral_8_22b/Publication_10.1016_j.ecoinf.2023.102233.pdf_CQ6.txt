Based on the given context, there isn't explicit information about specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that all audio data were unlabelled at the commencement of the study. This implies that some form of labeling or annotation process might have been performed as part of the preprocessing step. Additionally, the context mentions that the recorders captured audio data as FLAC files at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz for the solar-powered bioacoustic recorders and WAV files at a 32 kHz sampling rate for the Audiomoth recorders. Therefore, it can be assumed that the raw audio data might have undergone format conversion and resampling to ensure consistency across the dataset. Furthermore, common practices in audio processing include noise reduction, silence removal, and feature extraction techniques such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or spectrogram generation. Although these methods aren't explicitly mentioned in the context, they could potentially be included in the preprocessing pipeline based on standard procedures in audio signal processing and machine learning applications.
