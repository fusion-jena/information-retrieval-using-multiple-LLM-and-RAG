The dataset was divided into three parts for the purpose of training, validating, and testing the deep learning models. Specifically, 70% of the dataset was allocated for training, 10% for validation, and the remaining 20% for testing. This distribution was maintained consistently while working with both Random Forest (RF) and YAMNet-based algorithms.
