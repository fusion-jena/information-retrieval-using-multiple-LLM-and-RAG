The paper by L. Martinez-Sanchez et al. uses semantic image segmentation with deep convolutional nets, atrous convolution, and fully connected CRFs. The Deeplabv3+ architecture with COCO classes is also mentioned in the context. Therefore, the type of deep learning models used in this pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
