Audio data is input to the network in a novel spectrogram representation. Networks pre-trained on image data have been proven to perform well on classification tasks using spectrograms as image input, transformed from raw audio data. In this work, the authors use a spectrogram representation of the audio data as input to their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, both audio and image data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.
