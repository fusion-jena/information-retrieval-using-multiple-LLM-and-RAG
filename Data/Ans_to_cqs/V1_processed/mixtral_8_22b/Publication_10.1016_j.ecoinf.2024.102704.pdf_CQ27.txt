After training the deep learning model using the PyTorch 1.9 deep learning framework on a laptop with an Intel(R) i7-11800H CPU and a GeForce RTX3080 GPU, the next step would be to deploy the trained model. However, the given context does not provide explicit information about the deployment process.

Typically, after training a deep learning model, it needs to be serialized or saved so that it can be used later for prediction or inference tasks. This involves saving the model architecture and its learned weights and biases to a file. Once the model has been serialized, it can be loaded back into memory when needed.

In terms of platform selection, the choice depends on various factors such as hardware requirements, scalability, latency, cost, and ease of use. For instance, if the application requires real-time predictions, a cloud-based solution like AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform might be suitable. On the other hand, if the application runs on edge devices with limited computing power, a lightweight framework like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime could be used.

However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine which specific steps were taken to deploy the trained deep learning model in this case.
