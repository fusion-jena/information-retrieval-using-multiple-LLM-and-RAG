The text does not provide explicit information about specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it mentions that data augmentation techniques are employed to address the issue of overfitting. Data augmentation is a strategy that involves increasing the amount of training data available by applying various transformations to the original dataset. These transformations may include rotating, scaling, flipping, cropping, or adding noise to images. By doing so, the model becomes exposed to a larger variety of examples, making it more robust and less prone to overfitting. Additionally, the use of attention mechanisms is mentioned as a way to improve the performance of deep learning models. Attention mechanisms allow the model to selectively focus on certain parts of the input data, effectively reducing the impact of irrelevant or noisy features and potentially mitigating overfitting.
