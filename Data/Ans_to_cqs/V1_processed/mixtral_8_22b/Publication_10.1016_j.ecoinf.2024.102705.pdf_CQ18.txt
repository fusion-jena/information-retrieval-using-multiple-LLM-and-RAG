The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves utilizing Average Precision (AP) as a mainstream performance metric. This metric represents the area under the precision-recall curve, denoted as P (precision) and R (recall) at different thresholds. By employing this strategy, the researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of their model throughout the training process.
