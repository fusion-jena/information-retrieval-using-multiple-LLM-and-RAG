The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved using TensorBoard. By observing the validation loss and comparing it to the training loss, researchers could determine if the model was overfitting or underfitting. Additionally, they utilized custom implementations of evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and overall accuracy to further gauge the model's performance. These metrics were computed during the forward pass and served as indicators rather than being directly optimized through backpropagation.
