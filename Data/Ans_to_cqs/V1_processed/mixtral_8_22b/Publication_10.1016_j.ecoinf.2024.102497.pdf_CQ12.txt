Based on the given information, it appears that the study does not use any deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, the authors employ traditional machine learning algorithms, specifically Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) methods, for their analysis. They utilize the'sklearn' library in Python to implement these models. The focus of this research seems to be on predicting wetland areas and depths using linear regression models and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Cellular Automata rather than deep learning approaches.
