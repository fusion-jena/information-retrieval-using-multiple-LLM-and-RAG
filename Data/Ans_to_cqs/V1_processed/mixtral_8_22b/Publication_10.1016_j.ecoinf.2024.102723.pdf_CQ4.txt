Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shifting, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the amount of training data and improve model performance by introducing variations into the dataset.
