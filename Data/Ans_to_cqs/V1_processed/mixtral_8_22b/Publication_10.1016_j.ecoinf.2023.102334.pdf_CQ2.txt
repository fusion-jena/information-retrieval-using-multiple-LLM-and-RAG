Based on the given context, we cannot determine the exact data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, since the research focuses on facial recognition of sika deer, it is safe to assume that images are used as input data. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer models, both of which typically process image or video data. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning pipeline uses image data as input.
