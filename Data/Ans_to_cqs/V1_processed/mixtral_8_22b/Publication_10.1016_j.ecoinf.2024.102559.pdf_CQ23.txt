The paper does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using diverse datasets or employing techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the accuracy metrics for models with average and entropy features were calculated across multiple window sizes, which could be interpreted as a form of parameter tuning to improve the robustness and generalization performance of the model. Additionally, the study used both producer's and user's accuracies along with overall accuracy to evaluate the performance of the models, providing a more comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness.
