The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it is common practice in machine learning and remote sensing applications to perform various preprocessing techniques such as data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves transforming the input features so they have zero mean and unit variance, which helps stabilize the learning process. Scaling refers to rescaling the range of feature values to prevent large-scale features from dominating others during model training. Cleaning involves removing noise, outliers, and missing values from the dataset to ensure high-quality inputs for the model. These preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the datasets used and the requirements of the chosen deep learning algorithm.
