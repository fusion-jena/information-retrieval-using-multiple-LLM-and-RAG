The given text does not provide any explicit information about which specific frameworks or libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately state which frameworks were utilized based solely on this excerpt.

Based on the provided context, we only know that the authors used a combination of feature classes ('L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP') and regularization multipliers from 0.5 to 5 to optimize their model. They also mentioned employing the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) for evaluating the model's performance. However, there is no mention of any particular deep learning framework being used.
