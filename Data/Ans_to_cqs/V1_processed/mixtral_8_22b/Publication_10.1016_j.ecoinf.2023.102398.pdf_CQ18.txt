To monitor the model performance during training, the authors have employed several strategies. They have trained the model with varying epoch values such as 100, 150, 200, and 250 to explore the impact of epoch on training results. This approach helps them identify the optimal number of epochs required for achieving the best possible accuracy without overfitting or underfitting the model. Additionally, they have utilized various evaluation metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP), Confusion Matrix, F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC curves to assess the model's performance. Furthermore, they have visualized the training progress using figures depicting the loss function, learning rate schedules, and other relevant information. Lastly, they have ensured that the dataset used for training is sufficiently large and diverse to prevent any potential biases or limitations in the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
