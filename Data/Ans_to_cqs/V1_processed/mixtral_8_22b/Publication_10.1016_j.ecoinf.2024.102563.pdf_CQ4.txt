The given context does not provide information on specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotation, or scaling. However, it does mention several studies related to remote sensing, image processing, and machine learning techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Random Forests (RFs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). These techniques can be part of a deep learning pipeline but do not directly address the topic of data augmentation. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the given context regarding the specific data augmentation techniques mentioned in the query.
