The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge, some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adam. These techniques help minimize the loss function during training by adjusting the model parameters iteratively. For instance, SGD updates the weights using the gradient of the error with respect to the weights for each training example, while Adam combines the advantages of both AdaGrad and RMSProp algorithms to provide an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients on noisy problems.
