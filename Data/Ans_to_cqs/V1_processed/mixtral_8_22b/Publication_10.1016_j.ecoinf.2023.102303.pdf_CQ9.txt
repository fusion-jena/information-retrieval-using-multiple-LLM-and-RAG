The text does not explicitly mention the specific data repository where the FishInTurbidWater dataset or the deep learning pipelines are available. However, common practices suggest that researchers often share their datasets and code on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GitHub. Given that the authors contributed to the first weakly-supervised fish dataset in turbid waters, they might have made the dataset publicly accessible through one of these platforms. To find out the exact location, I recommend checking the original research paper or contacting the authors directly.
