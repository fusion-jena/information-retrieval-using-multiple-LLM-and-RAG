The information provided does not explicitly mention what data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the Dive Reporter app collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers, which suggests that the data format might include structured data such as CSV files. It is also mentioned that the app does not require submission of photographic evidence, indicating that image data may not be part of the deep learning pipeline. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively state the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
