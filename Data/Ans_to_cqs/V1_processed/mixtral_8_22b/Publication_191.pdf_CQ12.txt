The text mentions that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are being used for plant species identification. Specifically, they discuss various models such as AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet, which are all types of CNN architectures. Therefore, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
