Based on the provided information, there isn't any explicit mention of how the hyperparameters were optimized, such as using methods like grid search or random search. However, it does state that different settings of momentum and weight decay were checked, which suggests some form of manual tuning or experimentation was conducted. Additionally, the authors note that these specific parameters gave the best results in their evaluations. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that they likely tried various combinations of hyperparameters and selected those that performed best based on their evaluation metrics.
