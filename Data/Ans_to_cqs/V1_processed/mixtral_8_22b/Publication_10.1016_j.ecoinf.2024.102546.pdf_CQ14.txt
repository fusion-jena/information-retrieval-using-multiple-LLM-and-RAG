The primary hyperparameters for the YOLOX and YOLOv8 detection models include initial learning rate, learning rate schedule, NMS threshold, confidence threshold, weight decay, image size, batch size, and optimizer. However, the context does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were optimized. Therefore, it is unknown whether they used techniques such as grid search or random search for optimization.
