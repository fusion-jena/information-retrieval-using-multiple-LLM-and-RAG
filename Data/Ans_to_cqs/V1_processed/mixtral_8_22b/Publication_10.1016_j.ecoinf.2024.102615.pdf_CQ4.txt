Unfortunately, there isn't any specific information about data augmentation techniques applied in the given context. However, some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, shifting, shearing, and adding noise. These techniques help increase the amount of training data available and improve the generalizability of the model.

Flipping involves horizontally or vertically reversing images, while rotation involves rotating images by a certain degree. Scaling changes the size of the image, either increasing or decreasing it. Cropping removes parts of the image, while zooming magnifies portions of the image. Shifting moves the image along one axis, and shearing distorts the image along one axis. Adding noise introduces random variations into the image. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data being analyzed and the goals of the analysis.
