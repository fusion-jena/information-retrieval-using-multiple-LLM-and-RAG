Based on the given context, there is no information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, some commonly used evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC), among others. These metrics help assess different aspects of the model's performance, such as its ability to correctly classify instances, balance between false positives and negatives, or overall predictive power. Without further details about the specific application or type of deep learning model being used, it is not possible to provide a more precise answer.
