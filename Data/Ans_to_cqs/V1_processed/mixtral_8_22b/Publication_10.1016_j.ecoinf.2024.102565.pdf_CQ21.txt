After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the type of problem being solved and the desired output. Here are some common postprocessing steps:

1. Model Evaluation: After training, it is essential to evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. These metrics help assess how well the model has learned from the training data and its ability to generalize to new data. In this study, the authors used R2, RMSE, MAE, and MBE as evaluation metrics.

2. Prediction Generation: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to generate predictions for new data. For example, in this study, the models were used to predict soil moisture content based on input features such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.

3. Uncertainty Quantification: Some models provide not only point estimates but also insights into prediction uncertainty. For instance, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which was one of the models used in this study, provides a measure of uncertainty along with each prediction. This information can be useful in decision-making processes where uncertainty needs to be taken into account.

4. Visualization: Postprocessing may involve visualizing the results of the model in different ways. For example, saliency maps can be generated to highlight important regions in the input data that contribute most to the predicted outcome. Similarly, confusion matrices can be created to visualize the performance of classification models. However, these techniques do not seem to have been employed in this particular study.
