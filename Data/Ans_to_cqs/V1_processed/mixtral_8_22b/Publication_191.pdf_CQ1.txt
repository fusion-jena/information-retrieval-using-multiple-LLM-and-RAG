The text does not provide explicit information about the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of datasets such as the PlantClef2015 dataset and the ILSVRC 2010 dataset, which suggests that public datasets may be one source of raw data. Additionally, the mention of "very large amounts of training data" implies that data collection could involve gathering a significant volume of images. Without more specific details, it cannot be determined whether methods like surveys or sensors were employed for data collection.
