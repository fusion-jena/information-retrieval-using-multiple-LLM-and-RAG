Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. Instead, the focus appears to be on tuning hyperparameters for a Random Forest Regressor, which is not a deep learning model but rather an ensemble learning method for classification and regression tasks. Therefore, without additional information, it cannot be determined what type of deep learning model, if any, was used in the pipeline.
