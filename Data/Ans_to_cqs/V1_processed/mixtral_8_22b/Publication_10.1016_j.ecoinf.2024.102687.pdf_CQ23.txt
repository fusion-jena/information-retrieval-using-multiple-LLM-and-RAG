The text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, we can infer some aspects based on the given context.

Firstly, the study uses a diverse dataset called Darksound, which is likely to contribute to the generalizability of the model. Secondly, the authors mention that they use classical meta-learning architectures adapted from EasyFSL, suggesting that they may have employed techniques such as transfer learning or domain adaptation to enhance the model's ability to perform well across different datasets.

Additionally, the authors discuss the importance of the DBCV score for determining the optimal CNN backbone for fine-tuning the model without knowledge of the ground truth labels. This indicates that they may have used evaluation metrics like DBCV, ARI, and AMI to assess the performance of their model during development, which could help ensure its generalizability.

However, the text does not explicitly state whether the researchers used methods like cross-validation or stratified splitting to further validate the model's performance. Therefore, while some measures appear to be taken to promote generalizability, the full extent of these efforts remains unclear based solely on the provided context.
