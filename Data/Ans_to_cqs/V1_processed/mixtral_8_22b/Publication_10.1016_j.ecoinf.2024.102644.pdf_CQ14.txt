The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the Area Under Curve (AUC) was used to select the optimal hinge features, which suggests that some form of optimization might have been employed during the modeling process. Unfortunately, without more specific details regarding the methodology used, it cannot be definitively stated whether techniques such as grid search or random search were utilized for hyperparameter optimization.
