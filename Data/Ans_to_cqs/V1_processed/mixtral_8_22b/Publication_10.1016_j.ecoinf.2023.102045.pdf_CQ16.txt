The provided context does not contain information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete or any reference to validation loss plateaus. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based solely on the given text. However, generally speaking, some common criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning models include reaching a predefined number of epochs, achieving a desired level of performance on a validation dataset, observing no significant improvement in validation loss over several epochs (validation loss plateau), or meeting other user-specified conditions.
