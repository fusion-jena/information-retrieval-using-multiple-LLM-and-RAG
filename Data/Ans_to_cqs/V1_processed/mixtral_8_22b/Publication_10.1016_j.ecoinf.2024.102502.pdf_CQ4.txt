The text does not provide specific details about the application of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the concept of data scaling, which can be considered a form of data augmentation. Data scaling involves adjusting the size or resolution of datasets to match different spatial and temporal scales. This technique is used to aggregate data across scales before modeling, following a pre-modeling scaling protocol. It is particularly useful for gap-filling operations, allowing users to avoid missing information within extracted data by increasing the spatio-temporal scale around ground observations. This process is facilitated by platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE), which offer advanced frameworks and enhanced computational power for handling large-scale EOS data.
