The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, considering the nature of the problem being addressed - modeling the spread of wildfires or pests - it can be inferred that the input data might include geospatial data, weather data, and possibly satellite imagery. These types of data can come in various formats such as raster images (for satellite imagery), CSV files (for weather data), and shapefiles (for geospatial data). It is also possible that the data might need preprocessing before being fed into the deep learning model, depending on the specific requirements of the model architecture.
