Based on the provided context, there isn't explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, typically, the data is divided into three subsets: training, testing, and validation. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The division ratio can vary depending on the total amount of available data but commonly ranges from 60-80% for training, 10-20% for testing, and 10-20% for validation.
