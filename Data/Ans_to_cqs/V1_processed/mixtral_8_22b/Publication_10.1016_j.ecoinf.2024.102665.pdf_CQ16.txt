The text does not provide explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the process is repeated until convergence (no change) or a stopping point is reached. This suggests that the training continues until there are no further changes in the model parameters, indicating that the model has converged to a stable state. Additionally, the mention of a stopping point implies that there may be predefined conditions or thresholds set to halt the training process if certain criteria are met. Unfortunately, without more detailed information, it is not possible to specify the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete.
