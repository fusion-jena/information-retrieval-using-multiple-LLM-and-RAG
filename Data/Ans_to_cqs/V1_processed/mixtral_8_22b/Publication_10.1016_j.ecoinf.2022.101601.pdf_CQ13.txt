Unfortunately, based on the given context, there is no information about the hyperparameters used in any deep learning models. The context only provides details about various ecological models and their input parameters, such as snow depth, soil density, solar radiation, thermal conductivity, etc. There is no mention of any machine learning or deep learning models, let alone their specific hyperparameters like learning rates or optimizers. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
