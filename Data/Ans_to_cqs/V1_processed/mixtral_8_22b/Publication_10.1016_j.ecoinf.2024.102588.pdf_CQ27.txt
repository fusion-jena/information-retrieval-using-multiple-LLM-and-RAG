The text does not provide specific information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. It discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with and without an autoencoder for estimating various indices related to aquatic ecosystem health. The paper also compares the performance of these models with other conventional machine learning models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). However, it does not mention any details regarding the platform or method used for deploying the trained models. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a helpful answer to the query.
