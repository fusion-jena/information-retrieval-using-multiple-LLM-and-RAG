The text does not provide information about addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria and then randomly selecting samples from each subset. Oversampling increases the size of minority classes by duplicating examples, while undersampling reduces the size of majority classes by removing examples. Diverse data collection aims to collect data from various sources to ensure that the training data represents different scenarios and conditions.
