The given context does not provide specific details regarding the use of techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets or strata, ensuring each subset has approximately the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This helps maintain the balance between different classes while creating training and testing datasets.

Oversampling is a method where synthetic examples are created from existing minority class instances to increase their representation in the dataset. On the other hand, undersampling reduces the majority class instances to achieve a balanced distribution of classes. Both these techniques help mitigate the effects of class imbalance in the dataset.

Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and environments to ensure the model generalizes well across different scenarios. This can also involve collecting data from underrepresented groups to reduce any inherent biases present in the dataset.

While the given context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are widely adopted approaches to tackle data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
