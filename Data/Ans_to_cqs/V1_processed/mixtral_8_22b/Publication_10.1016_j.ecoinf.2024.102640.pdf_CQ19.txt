The text does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the SegFormer model. However, it is common practice in the field of deep learning to use popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to develop and train models like SegFormer. Therefore, while I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the given information, it is likely that one of these widely-used frameworks was employed.
