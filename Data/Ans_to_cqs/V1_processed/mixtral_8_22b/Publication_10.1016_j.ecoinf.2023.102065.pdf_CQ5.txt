The text does not explicitly mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that many 2D CNNs use well-labeled training and validation data from the study domain intended to optimize weights in existing image-based architectures like ResNet, VGGish, and MobileNet. These data are usually hard to acquire and thus have low sample sizes. This often leads to the use of larger labeled data from outside the study domain. The recent BirdCLEF competitions use weakly-labeled audio data. It can be inferred that the authors might have used similar types of datasets in their deep learning pipeline.

Based on this information, we cannot provide the exact names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be assumed that they used well-labeled training and validation data from the study domain along with some larger labeled data from outside the study domain. They may also have used weakly-labeled audio data similar to those used in the BirdCLEF competitions.
