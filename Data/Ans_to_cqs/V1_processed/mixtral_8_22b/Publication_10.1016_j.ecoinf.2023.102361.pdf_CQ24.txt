The given context does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, based on general practices in machine learning, one common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value before starting any process involving randomness. This ensures reproducibility of experiments and consistency across different runs. Another strategy could involve employing techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping to reduce the impact of randomness on the final results. These methods help in obtaining more robust estimates of model performance by averaging over multiple trials with different subsets of the data.
