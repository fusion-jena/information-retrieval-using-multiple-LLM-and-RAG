Before training a deep learning model like YWnet, there are several preprocessing steps involved to prepare the data. These steps include selecting appropriate water downloading gear and sensors for data collection. Once the data is collected, it goes through preprocessing, which involves tasks such as denoising, image enhancement, and correction. Denoising helps remove any unwanted noise or artifacts from the images, while image enhancement improves the overall quality of the images. Correction ensures that the images accurately represent the underwater environment.

After preprocessing, the dataset needs to be labeled to train and evaluate underwater target detection models. Labeling involves identifying and marking objects of interest within the images. For example, if the goal is to detect fish species, each instance of a fish would need to be identified and marked accordingly.

Once the dataset has been labeled, it is separated into training and test images. Training images are used to teach the model how to recognize specific patterns or features, while test images are used to evaluate its performance. During this stage, it is important to ensure that the training and test datasets are representative of the real-world scenarios where the model will be deployed.

In addition to preparing the data, it is also necessary to set up hardware servers capable of training deep learning models. This includes tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and network depth to optimize the model's performance. By carefully selecting and configuring these parameters, it is possible to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning model.
