Unfortunately, there is no information available regarding the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the given context. The text does mention that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prone to overfitting, which can be mitigated using various data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, etc. However, it does not provide any details about the exact methods employed in this particular study. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine what data augmentation techniques have been applied in the deep learning pipeline.
