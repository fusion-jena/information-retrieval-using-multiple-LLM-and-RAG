Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss the use of one-hot encoding to incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a multi-branch CNN architecture to integrate contextual information, but it doesn't provide details about how the data was labeled or annotated before being fed into the model. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it isn't possible to determine what data annotation techniques were used in their deep learning pipeline.
