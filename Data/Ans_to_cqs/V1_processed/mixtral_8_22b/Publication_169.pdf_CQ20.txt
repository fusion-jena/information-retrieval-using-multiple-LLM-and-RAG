Based on the given information, the specific type of hardware resource used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs, is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer some general hardware requirements from the provided context.

According to the experimental setup section, the CNN-LSTM model was implemented using Python libraries like Theano and Keras. These libraries often utilize GPU acceleration when available, which suggests that a GPU might have been used during the training process. Furthermore, the system specifications listed in Table 1 mention an Intel Core i7 CPU and 16 GB RAM, but do not provide explicit information about the use of GPUs or TPUs.

Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be definitively stated what specific hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, considering common practices in deep learning and the use of GPU-accelerated libraries, there is a possibility that a GPU was employed for training the model.
