Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available from the provided context to determine the exact process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, typically, once a deep learning model has been trained, it can be saved or serialized into a file format such as HDF5, JSON, or ONNX. This allows the model to be loaded later without having to retrain it. Once the model has been serialized, it can be deployed onto various platforms depending on the use case. For instance, if the model needs to run on mobile devices, it might need to be optimized for low power consumption and small storage space. On the other hand, if the model will be running on servers, it may require more computational resources but can handle larger datasets. In any case, the specific deployment process would depend on the requirements of the application and the capabilities of the platform being used.
