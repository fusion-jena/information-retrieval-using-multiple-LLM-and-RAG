The text does not explicitly mention any use of deep learning models. However, it discusses several practices used to improve the robustness and reliability of their models. These include the use of separate testing data and withholding known classes to evaluate the performance of the classifier. This approach is similar to cross-validation, where a portion of the data is held back during training and then used to test the model's ability to generalize. In this case, 25% of the samples were used as testing data, which is a common practice in machine learning. Additionally, the text mentions the use of resampling techniques and automated parameter tuning to optimize the final model configuration. While these practices do not directly address the diversity of the dataset, they contribute to improving the model's ability to generalize by preventing overfitting and ensuring optimal model parameters.
