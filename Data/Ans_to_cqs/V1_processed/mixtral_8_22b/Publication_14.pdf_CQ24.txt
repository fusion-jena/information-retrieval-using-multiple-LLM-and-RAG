The paper referenced here does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it does mention the use of dropout, which is a technique used during training to prevent overfitting. Dropout works by randomly removing a certain percentage of neurons from the network during each iteration of training, effectively creating a different 'view' of the data for each iteration. This introduces some level of randomness into the process but is controlled and intentional rather than being due to unpredictable factors like seed values. Other common strategies for managing randomness include setting specific seed values for reproducibility or using techniques like ensemble methods to combine multiple models trained with different seeds.
