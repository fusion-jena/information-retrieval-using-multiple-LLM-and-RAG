Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, common metrics used in evaluating deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total instances; precision indicates the ratio of true positive predictions to all predicted positives; recall shows the fraction of relevant instances retrieved among all relevant instances; F1 score combines both precision and recall; ROC curve plots true positive rate against false positive rate; and AUC represents the probability that a randomly chosen positive instance will have a higher predicted value than a randomly chosen negative one. It is important to note that the choice of evaluation metric depends on the problem type and requirements.
