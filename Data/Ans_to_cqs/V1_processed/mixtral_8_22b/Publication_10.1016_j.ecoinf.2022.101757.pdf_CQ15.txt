The given context does not provide information about the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or any other optimization technique. The text only mentions using DeeplabV3+, a convolutional neural network architecture, but does not specify the optimization method employed during its training process.
