The given context does not provide specific information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, it discusses the use of ensemble modeling, which combines multiple machine learning models to enhance predictive accuracy, increase stability, and improve generalization. Ensemble modeling is employed using the AUC-weighted ensemble method, where the performance metrics are utilized to effectively combine the predictions from all models. Among the evaluated machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) showed better performance compared to Classification and Regression Trees (CART). These models demonstrated high Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) values, indicating their effectiveness in accurately predicting forest fire susceptibility.
