The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does state that the architecture of the network follows GoogleNet's with 27 layers, including 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. Additionally, it mentions that certain parameters were adjusted, like the size of the strides and the first convolutions, to accommodate the size of the thumbnail images. These adjustments likely improved performance compared to a more traditional architecture. Unfortunately, without further information, it isn't possible to provide details about other hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer.
