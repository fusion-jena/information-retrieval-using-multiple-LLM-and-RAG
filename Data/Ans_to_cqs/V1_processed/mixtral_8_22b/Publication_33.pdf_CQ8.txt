The text does not explicitly mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the use of deep learning algorithms, specifically the last generation of deep learning algorithms, for controlling error rates in ecological studies. The authors also reference several sources related to deep learning, including publications on deep residual learning for image recognition and tensor flow systems for large-scale machine learning. However, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the exact location of the code repository for the specific deep learning pipeline discussed in the article.
