The given context does not provide explicit information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, some common data augmentation techniques often employed in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, and shifting. These methods help increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the generalizability of the model. It should be noted that the absence of such information in the provided context does not necessarily mean these techniques were not utilized.
