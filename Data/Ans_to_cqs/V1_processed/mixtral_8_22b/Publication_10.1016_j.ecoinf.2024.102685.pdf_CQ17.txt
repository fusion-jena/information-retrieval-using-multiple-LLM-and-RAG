Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning models to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. Regularization helps to improve the model's ability to generalize by adding constraints to the optimization problem. Two common regularization techniques used in deep learning pipelines are Dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent complex co-adaptations between neurons. This results in a more robust network with better generalization capabilities. During testing, all neurons are included but their outputs are scaled down based on the probability of being dropped during training.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, leading to simpler models that are less likely to overfit. The strength of this regularization can be controlled using a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter.

Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and batch normalization. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early stopping stops training once the validation error starts increasing, preventing further overfitting. Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and improving convergence speed.

These regularization methods help to balance the trade-off between bias and variance, allowing the model to achieve good performance both on the training data and unseen data. However, selecting the appropriate regularization method and tuning its parameters require careful experimentation and evaluation.
