Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function during optimization. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored or "dropped out" during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. By dropping out these neurons, the network becomes less sensitive to the specific weights of any single neuron, making it harder for the network to rely too heavily on any one feature.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, effectively reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights, encouraging sparse solutions. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error during training and halting the process once the error starts increasing, indicating potential overfitting. Data augmentation generates additional training samples by applying transformations such as rotations, translations, or noise addition, helping to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.
