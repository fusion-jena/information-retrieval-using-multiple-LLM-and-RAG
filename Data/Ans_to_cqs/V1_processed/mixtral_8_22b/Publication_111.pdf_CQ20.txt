The experimental setup mentioned in the context does not explicitly state the specific type of hardware resource used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it mentions that the experiments were performed on a computer running a 64-bit Linux OS with two 2.3 GHz Intel 8-core processors. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was trained using CPU resources rather than GPU or TPU resources.
