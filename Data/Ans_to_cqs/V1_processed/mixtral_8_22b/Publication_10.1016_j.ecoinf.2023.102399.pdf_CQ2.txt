The article discusses the use of deep learning techniques for acquiring high-quality images and estimating fish biomass automatically. From the given context, it can be inferred that the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. Specifically, the authors mention the use of underwater stereo images for recognizing the head and mouth of Southern Bluefin tuna. Additionally, they refer to the challenges of preprocessing fish images, including occlusion, overlapping, conglutination, bending, and non-orthogonal imaging angles. Furthermore, the authors note that most studies have focused on fish detection and species classification in underwater environments with complex backgrounds, which suggests that video data may also be used in some cases. However, there is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, we can conclude that the main data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are images and possibly videos.
