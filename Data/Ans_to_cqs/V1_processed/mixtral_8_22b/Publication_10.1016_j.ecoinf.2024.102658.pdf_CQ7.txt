Based on the given context, it appears that the authors have used a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) approach with one fold pattern of spatial-CV feature selection for calculating the validation scores of the models. However, the specific criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. In general, the data can be divided randomly or based on certain criteria such as time, location, or other relevant factors depending on the nature of the problem and the available data. It is also common practice to keep aside some portion of the data as a holdout set or test set to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.
