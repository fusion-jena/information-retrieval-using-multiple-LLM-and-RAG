The text does not provide explicit details about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it mentions that long audio files are divided into shorter chunks, typically with fixed durations like 3 or 10 seconds, to accommodate GPU memory limitations during processing. It also discusses the use of labeled and unlabeled examples in meta learning methods, where the prediction on the query set is conducted using techniques like label propagation or cross-attention mapping. Additionally, the text highlights challenges related to acquiring sufficient annotated audio examples due to factors like rarity of species, remoteness of locations, or expensive equipment requirements. These aspects suggest that the splitting of data might depend on various factors including computational resources, availability of labeled/unlabeled data, and domain-specific considerations.
