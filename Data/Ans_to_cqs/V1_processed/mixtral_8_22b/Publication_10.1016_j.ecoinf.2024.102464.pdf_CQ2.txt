The information provided does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study utilizes various environmental variables, which could potentially include data such as images, geospatial data, or other types of structured data like CSV files. The use of machine learning models suggests that the input data might have been preprocessed into numerical vectors suitable for these algorithms. Nevertheless, without further details about the exact nature of the environmental variables, it is impossible to definitively state the precise data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
