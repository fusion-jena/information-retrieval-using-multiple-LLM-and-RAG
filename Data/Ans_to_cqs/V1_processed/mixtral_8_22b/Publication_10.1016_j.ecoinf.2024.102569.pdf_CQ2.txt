Based on the provided context, it does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various environmental variables related to ecology, such as land area, forest area, water area, elevation, standard deviation of elevation, laplacian slope, geological category, annual average radiation, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, pH of soil, temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration amount, etc. These variables suggest that the data might be in a structured format like CSV or similar tabular form. Additionally, there is a reference to citizen science platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which could imply the use of images or other multimedia data formats. Nevertheless, without explicit information about the data format used in the deep learning pipeline, one cannot definitively state the exact data format being utilized.
