The article does not provide explicit details about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it mentions that the proposed method uses a deep neural network for mass estimation in aquaculture. Typically, after training a deep learning model, the next step involves saving or serializing the model weights and architecture into a file format such as.h5,.onnx, or.pb. This serialized model can then be loaded onto various platforms for inference. Common platforms include cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson, Intel Neural Compute Stick, etc. Based on the mentioned keywords and references, we can infer that the authors might have used similar steps to deploy their trained deep learning model. However, without concrete evidence from the text, this remains speculative.
