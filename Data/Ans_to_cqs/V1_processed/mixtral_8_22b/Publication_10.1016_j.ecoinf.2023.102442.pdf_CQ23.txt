Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the research. However, it can be inferred that the researchers might have employed techniques such as using diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities. These methods are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning applications to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the methodology used in developing the deep learning model, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
