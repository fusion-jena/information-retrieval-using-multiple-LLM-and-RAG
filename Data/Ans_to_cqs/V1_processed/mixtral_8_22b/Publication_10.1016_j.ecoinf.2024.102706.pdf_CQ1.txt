The given context does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of satellite image-based vegetation indices for predicting forest canopy cover, suggesting that satellite imagery could be one source of raw data. Additionally, the text refers to Planet data, implying that publicly available datasets might also be used. Nevertheless, without explicit mention of survey methods, sensor usage, or other data collection techniques, it cannot be definitively stated what methods are employed for gathering raw data in this particular case.
