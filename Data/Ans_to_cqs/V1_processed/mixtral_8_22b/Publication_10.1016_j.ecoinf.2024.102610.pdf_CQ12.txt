Based on the given context, it does not provide information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The paper by Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) discusses a systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases but does not specify which particular deep learning model was employed. Similarly, Khun (2022) provides details about classification and regression training using the package 'caret,' but no mention is made regarding any specific deep learning architecture such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional context, we cannot determine what kind of deep learning model is utilized in the pipeline.
