The paper does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that they utilize LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) images, which is a dataset collected through a survey conducted by EUROSTAT. Additionally, they also use North looking images from 2018 with land cover classifications such as croplands and grasslands. They do not provide any further information about how these images were obtained or if any additional sensors were used in the collection process. Therefore, based on the given context, it appears that the authors primarily rely on publicly available datasets like LUCAS and possibly satellite imagery for their raw data needs.
