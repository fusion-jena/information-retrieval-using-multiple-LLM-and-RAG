Unfortunately, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine what specific type of deep learning model was used in the pipeline. The context mentions object-oriented classification and discusses challenges related to training samples and their impact on classification models. However, there is no explicit mention of any particular deep learning architecture such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
