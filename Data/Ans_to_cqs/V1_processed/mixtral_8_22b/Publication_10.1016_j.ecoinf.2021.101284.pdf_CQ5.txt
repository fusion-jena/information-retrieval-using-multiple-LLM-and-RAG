The given context does not provide specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for early diagnosis of COVID-19 affected patients. However, it mentions that X-ray and computed tomography images were used. Therefore, we can infer that the dataset might consist of medical imaging data such as chest X-rays or CT scans. Unfortunately, without more specific information, we cannot determine if well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were utilized in this study.
