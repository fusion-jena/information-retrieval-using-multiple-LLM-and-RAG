Unfortunately, none of the given sources directly discuss or mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). These optimization techniques play a crucial role in training neural networks efficiently and effectively.

In general, optimization techniques like SGD and Adam help minimize the loss function during the training process. They adjust the weights and biases of the network iteratively based on the gradient of the loss function concerning those parameters. This allows the model to learn from its mistakes and improve over time.

While the mentioned papers cover various aspects of deep learning, including comparisons between different frameworks, applications in neuroscience, and event-based platforms for collaborative threat detection, there is no explicit discussion about optimization techniques within these works. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct reference to any particular source regarding the use of SGD or Adam in the deep learning pipeline.
