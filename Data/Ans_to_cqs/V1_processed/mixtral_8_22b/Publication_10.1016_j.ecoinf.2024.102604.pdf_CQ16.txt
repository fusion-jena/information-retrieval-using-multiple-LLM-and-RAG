The text does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is completed for the models mentioned. However, it can be inferred from general machine learning practices that common criteria include reaching a certain number of epochs or iterations, achieving a desired level of accuracy or performance, or observing a plateau in the validation loss. In some cases, early stopping may also be employed based on monitoring metrics like validation loss or accuracy over time. It should be noted that the exact criteria can vary depending on the specific algorithm and problem being addressed.
