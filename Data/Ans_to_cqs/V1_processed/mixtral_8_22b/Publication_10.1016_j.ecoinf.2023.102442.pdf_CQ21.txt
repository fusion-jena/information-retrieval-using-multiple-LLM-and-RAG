After the model training process, several postprocessing steps can be performed depending on the specific requirements of the project. Some common postprocessing steps include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices.

Saliency maps help visualize the importance of input features towards the prediction made by the model. They highlight the regions in the input space that contribute significantly to the decision-making process of the model. These maps can provide valuable insights into how the model interprets the input data and can aid in identifying potential biases or errors in the model.

Calculating various performance metrics is another crucial postprocessing step. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc. These metrics quantify the performance of the model and enable comparison between different models or configurations. Additionally, these metrics can assist in fine-tuning the model hyperparameters and selecting the optimal model architecture.

Creating confusion matrices is yet another important postprocessing step. A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the predictions made by the model compared to the actual labels. It helps identify patterns in misclassifications and enables the evaluation of the model's performance across individual classes. Furthermore, confusion matrices can reveal imbalances in the dataset and inform strategies for addressing them.

However, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific postprocessing steps employed after the model training phase. Therefore, it cannot be determined if any of the abovementioned techniques were utilized in this particular case.
