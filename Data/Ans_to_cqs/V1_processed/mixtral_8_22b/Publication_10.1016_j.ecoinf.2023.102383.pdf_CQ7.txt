To address the concern of an unbalanced distribution of deer numbers across different images in the dataset, the dataset was first divided into separate subsets based on the number of deer in each image. Each subset was then partitioned into three sections using a ratio of 75:15:15. This division allowed for a more balanced representation of deer numbers within each section, which could help improve the performance of the deep learning model during training. Therefore, the criterion used to split the data for deep learning model training was based on the number of deer in each image, ensuring a more even distribution of deer numbers across the training, validation, and testing subsets.
