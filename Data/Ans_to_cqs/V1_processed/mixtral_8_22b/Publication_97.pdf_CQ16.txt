The text does not explicitly state the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that after 1500 epochs, they obtained average values for the loss function that were less than 0.1. This suggests that one possible criterion for determining when training is complete might be reaching a certain threshold value for the loss function. Additionally, the mention of using a rolling average of the loss function implies that another potential criterion could be observing a stable or consistent trend in the loss function over multiple epochs. It is worth noting that these are just possibilities based on the information given, and other factors such as validation accuracy or performance on a separate test dataset may also play a role in deciding when to stop training.
