The method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is the use of acoustic sensors. These sensors generate reasonable amounts of data individually, but when multiple sensors are deployed, the amount of data that needs to be processed increases exponentially. The specific type of sensor used for recording garden birds is a Samsung S10 smartphone. This device records the audio and automatically uploads it to the platform using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Additionally, where in-field communication is unavailable, audio files can be batch uploaded through the website for offline inferencing.
