The text does not provide explicit information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that during each training stage, the model relative to the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set was selected to avoid any risk of overfitting. Additionally, it states that the weight decay was set to 5 Ã— 10^(-2.5), which could suggest the use of L2 regularization or weight decay as a form of regularization. Dropout, another common regularization method, is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
