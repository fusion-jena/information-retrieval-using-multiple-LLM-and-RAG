Based on the given context, it appears there is no direct mention or discussion about specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The focus of the provided information seems to be more on the use of various machine learning algorithms and their evaluation metrics rather than the preprocessing steps like data annotation. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the data annotation techniques used in this particular case.
