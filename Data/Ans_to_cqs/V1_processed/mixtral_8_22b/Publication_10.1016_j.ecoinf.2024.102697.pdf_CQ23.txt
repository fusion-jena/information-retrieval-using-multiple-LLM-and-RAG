To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models developed in this study, several measures were implemented. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, which likely includes various types of crops and environmental conditions. Secondly, a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach was employed for all ML models. This approach involved dividing the data into holdout data and data for model development using an outer 10 k-fold cross-validation. Then, an inner 5 k-fold cross-validation was applied to minimize the bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results. Lastly, the training performance was determined based on the inner cross-validated ensemble, while the testing performance was established by choosing the best set of hyperparameters from the whole training set to forecast on the holdout data. This procedure was carried out 15 times for every distinct model to mitigate any possible bias or variance related to random sampling.
