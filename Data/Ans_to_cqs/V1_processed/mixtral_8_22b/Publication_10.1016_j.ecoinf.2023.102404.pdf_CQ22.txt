To evaluate the performance of their deep learning model, the authors used three main metrics: Mean Bias Error (MBE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R². These metrics are commonly used in regression tasks like this one.

Mean Bias Error (MBE) measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values. It provides information about whether the model tends to underestimate or overestimate the target variable. In this case, the MBE for the 10 m CHM was 0.05 m, which means that the predicted values were slightly more than the observed values on average, indicating a slight overestimation.

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the average magnitude of the errors made by the model. It gives us an idea of how far off the predictions are from the actual values. Here, the RMSE for the 10 m CHM was 4.40 m, meaning that the average difference between the predicted and observed values was 4.40 meters.

R², also known as the coefficient of determination, shows the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. An R² value close to 1 suggests that the model explains most of the variability in the response data around its mean. In this study, the R² value for the 10 m CHM was 0.74, indicating a moderate correlation between the predicted and observed values.
