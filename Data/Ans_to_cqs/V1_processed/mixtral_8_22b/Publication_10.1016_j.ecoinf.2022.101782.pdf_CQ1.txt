In the provided context, the authors discuss a workflow designed to leverage citizen science data and extract relevant records from social media posts about a specific species, in this case, red kites. While the context doesn't explicitly mention the collection of raw data via surveys, sensors, or public datasets, it does imply that the researchers utilize existing citizen science data and social media data.

Citizen science data refers to scientific observations made by non-professional volunteers, typically collected through platforms like iNaturalist, eBird, or Zooniverse. In this case, the researchers likely sourced bird sighting data documented and recorded by citizen scientists.

For social media data, the researchers employed a method that combines textual metadata and image content to identify relevant sightings. They achieved this by utilizing off-the-shelf, pre-trained algorithms capable of identifying predefined classes, such as the presence of birds, in image data with reasonable accuracy.

To summarize, although the context does not directly state the use of traditional data collection methods like surveys, sensors, or public datasets, it implies that the researchers rely on citizen science data and social media data. They employ advanced techniques, including content-based classification and pre-trained algorithms, to process and analyze these data sources within their workflow.
