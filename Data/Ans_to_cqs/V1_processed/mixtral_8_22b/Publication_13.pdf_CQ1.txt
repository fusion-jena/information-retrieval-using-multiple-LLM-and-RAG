The study utilizes deep learning approaches for classifying insects, specifically Coleoptera (beetles), based on bulk-sample images obtained from high-throughput biodiversity surveys. The raw data collection involves gathering bulk samples of poorly known communities of Coleoptera from various locations worldwide. These samples are then subjected to high-throughput processing and imaging techniques.

For instance, a subset of single specimens taken from these bulk samples is individually photographed using a conventional stereoscope, namely the NIKON SMZ1270i, equipped with a NIKON DS-Fi3 Microscope Camera (5.9 megapixels) controlled by the NIKON DS-L4 v.1.5.0.3 control unit. This process results in the creation of the Local Low Quality (LL) dataset, representing a more realistic scenario of local-based classification in biodiversity studies.

Therefore, the primary method employed for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is through conducting high-throughput biodiversity surveys and utilizing specialized equipment such as stereoscopes and microscopes to capture detailed images of individual specimens within the gathered bulk samples.
