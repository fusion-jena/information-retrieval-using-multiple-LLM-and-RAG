The text does not provide explicit information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study involves identifying ecological mechanisms governing natural plant distributions using remote sensing techniques. This suggests that the datasets could be related to remote sensing or satellite imagery rather than commonly known computer vision datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Furthermore, the paper discusses mapping individual tree species in tropical forests, which implies that the datasets might contain high-resolution images of forest landscapes. Unfortunately, without more detailed information from the original source, we cannot definitively state what datasets were used in their deep learning pipeline.

Based on the given context, I can infer that the authors likely used custom datasets tailored to their research objectives involving remote sensing and semantic segmentation tasks. These datasets would have been specifically designed for training and evaluating models capable of accurately identifying and classifying various tree species within complex forest environments.
