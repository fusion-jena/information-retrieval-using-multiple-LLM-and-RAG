The text does not provide explicit information about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, some aspects can be inferred indirectly. For instance, the use of diverse datasets such as remote sensing images of the study area and mean groundwater data from April to September suggests that the model might have been trained on varied data sources. Additionally, the mention of iterative testing implies that the model underwent several rounds of validation or optimization, which could potentially contribute to its robustness and generalizability. Nevertheless, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated what exact measures were taken for ensuring the model's generalizability.
