The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and feature engineering. Normalization scales numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling adjusts the values to a standard scale. Cleaning involves handling missing or inconsistent data points. Feature engineering creates new features from existing ones to improve model performance. These preprocessing steps help ensure optimal performance and accuracy when training a deep learning model.
