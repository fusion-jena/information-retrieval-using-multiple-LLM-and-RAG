The text does not provide explicit information about the specific strategy used to monitor the model performance during training. However, it mentions that the proposed method significantly reduces computational complexity and model size compared to the original YOLOv5 algorithm. This suggests that monitoring strategies such as tracking resource utilization (e.g., GPU memory usage), training time, or other relevant metrics could have been employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimized model. Additionally, techniques like validation set evaluation or cross-validation might also be utilized to assess the model's generalization capabilities during training. Nevertheless, without further details from the authors, one cannot definitively state the exact strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
