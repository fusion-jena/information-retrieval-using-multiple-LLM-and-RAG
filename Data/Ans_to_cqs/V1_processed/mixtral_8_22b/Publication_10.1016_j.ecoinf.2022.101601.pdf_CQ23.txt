The given context does not provide information about any specific deep learning model or its development process. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model based solely on this context. However, generally speaking, there are several methods used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models, including using diverse datasets, cross-validation, stratified splitting, regularization techniques, early stopping, and transfer learning. These methods help prevent overfitting and improve the ability of the model to perform well on new data. Without more information about the specific deep learning model being referred to, I cannot provide a detailed response regarding the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.
