To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was utilized, consisting of samples collected from different locations and times. This diversity in the dataset helped to capture various patterns and characteristics present in the real world, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data. Secondly, cross-validation was employed during the training process. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or folds and then iteratively training the model on one fold while validating it on another. This technique helps to reduce overfitting and provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance on new data. Lastly, stratified splitting was applied when partitioning the dataset into training and validation sets. Stratified splitting ensures that both sets maintain similar distributions of classes or labels, preventing any bias towards certain classes during training and evaluation. By implementing these measures, the researchers aimed to enhance the reliability and applicability of their deep learning model across different scenarios and datasets.
