Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting. These techniques help increase the size of the dataset and improve model performance by introducing variations into the existing data. It should be noted that the choice of data augmentation technique depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset.
