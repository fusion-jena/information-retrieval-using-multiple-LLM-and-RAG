The context does not provide specific details on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that one requirement for deep learning is the availability of a vast amount of training data. It suggests augmenting the training dataset by using different brightness levels, adding vertically and horizontally flipped versions, shifting, rotating, or adding noisy versions of the training images. These techniques imply that the original raw data might come from various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. In general, common methods for collecting raw data include using sensors like cameras, LiDAR, radar, etc., conducting surveys through questionnaires or interviews, and utilizing publicly available datasets.
