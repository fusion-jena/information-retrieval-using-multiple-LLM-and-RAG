The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data might include categorical and continuous discrete values based on the use of regression and classification prediction tasks. Additionally, the use of QGIS suggests geospatial data may be involved. Without more explicit information about the data types, it is difficult to definitively state what data formats are being used.
