The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is object detection. This is evident from several references made throughout the text, including mentions of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8), which is a popular object detection algorithm. Additionally, there are discussions about improving the model's performance in terms of speed and accuracy, which are common goals when working with object detection models. Furthermore, the mention of using the model for tasks like NBSB detection and counting reinforces the idea that the primary function of this deep learning model is object detection.
