The text does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it mentions several strategies that could potentially address this issue. These include combining labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised framework, which might enhance the model's ability to learn generalized features even with limited training data. Additionally, the use of self-supervised learning, which employs unsupervised methods to create training data for supervised models, was mentioned as a possible solution to overcome data limitations in deep learning applications. Furthermore, the text suggests that improving the model might require a combination of better validation data and more hand-annotated training samples, particularly for customizing the model to local geographical areas. Lastly, the integration of hyperspectral data could aid in subdividing the 'tree' class into various species labels, offering extra insights into aspects like economic value or carbon storage capacity across extensive geographical regions. Despite these suggestions, the text emphasizes that further research is necessary to determine the optimal method for integrating data among different scales and sensors.
