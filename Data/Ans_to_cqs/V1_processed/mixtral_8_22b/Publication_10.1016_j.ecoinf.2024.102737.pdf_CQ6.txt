Based on the given context, the preprocessing step mentioned involves face preprocessing adjustment to handle various conditions like poses, illuminations, expressions, and occlusions. This process is divided into two categories: one-to-many augmentation and many-to-one normalization. One-to-many augmentation generates multiple patches or images of pose variability from a single image, enabling deep networks to learn pose-invariant representations. On the other hand, many-to-one normalization recovers the canonical view of face images from images of a non-frontal view, allowing face recognition to be performed as if it were under controlled conditions. However, the context does not explicitly mention any general preprocessing steps typically used before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
