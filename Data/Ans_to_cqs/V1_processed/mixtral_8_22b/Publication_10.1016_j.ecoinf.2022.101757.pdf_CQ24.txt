The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it mentions the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to improve the precision of object delineation in semantic segmentation. This technique helps compensate for the limited performance of neural networks in generating precisely delineated objects due to the loss of effective spatial resolution during the learning process. To evaluate the improvement gained from using CRF, the authors calculated the length of signals extracted with and without CRF and evaluated the gain length. While this approach doesn't directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it demonstrates a strategy for improving the accuracy of object delineation in semantic segmentation tasks.
