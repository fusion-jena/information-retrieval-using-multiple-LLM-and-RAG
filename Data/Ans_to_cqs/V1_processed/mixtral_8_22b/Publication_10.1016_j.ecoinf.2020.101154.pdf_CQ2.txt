Based on the given information, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses non-image or non-audio data formats such as CSV files containing numerical values. This can be inferred from the use of Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) as the machine learning method, which typically works well with structured tabular data like CSV files. Additionally, the mention of salinity measurements, sea surface temperature (SST), and other environmental factors suggests that the input features are likely numeric rather than images, videos, or audio files. However, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively state the exact format of the data being used in the deep learning pipeline.
