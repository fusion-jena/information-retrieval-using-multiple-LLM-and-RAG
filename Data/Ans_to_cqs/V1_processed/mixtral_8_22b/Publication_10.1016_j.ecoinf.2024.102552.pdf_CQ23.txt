The text does not provide explicit details about any specific deep learning models used or the measures taken to ensure their generalizability. However, it mentions that machine learning methods, including deep learning techniques, could potentially help refine classifications with the aid of spectral libraries or other remote sensing products. The authors caution that while machine learning methods have significant potential for automatic or supervised classification, they are still constrained by the quality of their input data, both imagery and training datasets. They suggest that using high-quality imagery like NAIP and large training datasets can yield good performance, but warn that these methods might struggle when applied to historical imagery due to its variability in terms of blurriness and distortion. Therefore, further testing is required. Based on this information, one can infer that diverse datasets and possibly cross-validation or stratified splitting might have been considered to enhance the robustness and generalizability of the deep learning models. However, without concrete evidence, it remains speculative.
