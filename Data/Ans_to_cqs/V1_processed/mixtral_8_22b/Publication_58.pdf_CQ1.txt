The given context does not provide explicit details about the method used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the SPOT6 satellite data was used for the five study areas. This suggests that the raw data might have been collected using satellite imagery. Satellite imagery is commonly used in remote sensing applications, including land cover classification tasks like the one described in the context. Therefore, it can be inferred that the method utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is likely satellite imagery.
