The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning models. However, it can be inferred from the context that the models were deployed on Nvidia Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs for training purposes. Additionally, one of the models mentioned, MnasNet-A1, was specifically designed to be faster for mobile devices, suggesting that platform selection may have been considered during deployment. Unfortunately, without explicit details about the deployment process, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the exact methods used for model serialization or platform selection.
