The table titled "MLP parameters and performance" provides information on the performance of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) deep learning model. Two main metrics are used to evaluate its performance: Training Root Mean Square (RMS) error and Testing RMS error. These errors represent the difference between predicted values and actual values during training and testing phases respectively. Additionally, the Accuracy Rate and Skill Measure (%) provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify data. In this case, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 88.79% and a skill measure of 0.8719. However, it should be noted that other common evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
