Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model because there is no mention of any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch being used. Instead, the context mentions the use of the Python programming language and the'sklearn' library to implement the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the context does not provide information about the use of any deep learning frameworks.
