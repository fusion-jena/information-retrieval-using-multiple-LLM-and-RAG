The authors do not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, they do state that Python 3.8.0 and Jupyter Notebook v6.4.5 were used for image processing. This suggests that the deep learning models might have been built using libraries compatible with Python, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation from the authors, we cannot definitively determine which framework was used.
