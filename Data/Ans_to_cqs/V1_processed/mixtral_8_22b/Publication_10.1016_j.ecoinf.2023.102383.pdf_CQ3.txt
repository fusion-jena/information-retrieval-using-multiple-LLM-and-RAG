The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the method employed is bounding box annotation. This is evident from Figure 10, where the instances of deer are enclosed within rectangular bounding boxes. Bounding box annotation is a popular technique used in object detection tasks, where the objective is to draw a rectangle around the target object in an image.

In this case, the goal was to create a comprehensive dataset comprising 2278 thermal images and 13,509 deer instance annotations. To achieve this, a team of two scientists and two students dedicated four hours each day over seven days to manually annotate the images. A rigorous verification process was also implemented to eliminate any subjective biases and maintain the accuracy and reliability of the annotations.

While the text does not discuss other data annotation techniques such as semantic segmentation or instance segmentation, these methods could potentially be applied to similar datasets depending on the specific requirements of the project. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to every pixel in an image, whereas instance segmentation focuses on identifying individual instances of objects belonging to the same class.
