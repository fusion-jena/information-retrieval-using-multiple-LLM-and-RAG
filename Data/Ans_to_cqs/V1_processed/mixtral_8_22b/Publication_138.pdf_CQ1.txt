Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various models such as LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, which are known to use large-scale image datasets like ImageNet for training and evaluation purposes. These datasets are publicly available and consist of millions of labeled images across thousands of categories. Therefore, one could infer that the authors might have used these public datasets for their experiments. Nonetheless, without specific details regarding the collection process or any other sources mentioned, it cannot be definitively stated what methods were employed for gathering raw data.
