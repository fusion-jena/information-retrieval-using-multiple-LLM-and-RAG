Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned what specific data annotation techniques were used in their deep learning pipeline. However, they did mention classifying thumbnail characteristics into six categories and recording each category as a separate column with a value of 0 or 1. This suggests that they might be using binary classification or multi-label classification methods. They also mentioned identifying objects such as cameras or binoculars in the videos, which could imply the use of object detection techniques like bounding boxes or semantic segmentation. But without more detailed information about their deep learning pipeline, it cannot be confirmed which exact data annotation techniques were employed.
