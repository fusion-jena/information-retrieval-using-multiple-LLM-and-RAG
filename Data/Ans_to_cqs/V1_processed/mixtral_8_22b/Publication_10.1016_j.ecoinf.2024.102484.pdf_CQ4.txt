The given context does not provide information about specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning for monitoring ecosystem service changes in the city of Shenzhen (Huang et al., 2019). In general, common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, zooming, and shifting images. These techniques help increase the diversity of training datasets and prevent overfitting. Nevertheless, without explicit mention in the provided context, we cannot confirm which specific data augmentation techniques were employed in this case.
