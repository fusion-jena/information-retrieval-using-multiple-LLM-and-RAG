Based on the given context, there is no mention of using a specific deep learning model like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, the text discusses the process of generating redescriptions based on certain constraints and filters applied to the data. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer regarding the use of a specific deep learning model in the pipeline.
