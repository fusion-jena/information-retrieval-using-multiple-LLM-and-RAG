The text does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does indicate that the input images were resized to a 512 x 512 resolution and rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments were applied as augmentation techniques for better network generalization. These techniques suggest that some form of image annotation was performed, possibly involving pixel-level labeling for semantic segmentation, given that the task involves distinguishing between leaves and background. Semantic segmentation typically requires dense pixel-level annotations, where each pixel in the image is assigned a class label. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data annotation technique used in this case might involve pixel-level labeling for semantic segmentation.
