The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score. Precision refers to the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a single metric for evaluating the overall performance of the model. F2-score is similar to F1-score but gives more weightage to recall than precision. In this case, the performance of the PTDLEN-VAE model was compared with other techniques based on these metrics. For instance, on the UCM dataset, the PTDLEN-VAE model achieved a maximum average precision of 96%, while the DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM techniques had a minimum average precision of 95.70%, 95.68%, and 95.49%, respectively. Similarly, the PTDLEN-VAE model achieved a maximum average recall of 95.35%, while the DLEN-VAE, DLEN-DNN, and DLEN-LSTM techniques had a lower average recall of 94.90%, 94.93%, and 94.73%, respectively.
