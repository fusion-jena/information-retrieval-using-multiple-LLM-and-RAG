To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is using fixed random seeds during training, which ensures reproducibility by generating the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers each time the code is executed. This allows researchers to compare results across different experiments or architectures more accurately. Another strategy involves averaging multiple runs with different initializations to reduce the impact of any single initialization on the final performance metrics. Additionally, techniques such as dropout regularization and data augmentation introduce controlled randomness into the model architecture and input data, respectively, helping prevent overfitting and improving generalizability. Lastly, Bayesian methods like Monte Carlo Dropout can provide uncertainty estimates alongside predictions, accounting for inherent stochasticity within the model itself.
