In the given context, several data augmentation techniques were applied to the entire training dataset for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. These techniques include rotations between 0 and 360 degrees, reflection by the vertical axis, and vertical shifting by Â±5 pixels. Additionally, standard image normalization for CNNs was performed, which maps the 8-bit pixel values to floating-point values between 0 and 1. Data augmentation helps improve the generalizability and robustness of the model by creating new training examples through various transformations of existing ones. It also prevents overfitting by increasing the diversity of the training data without collecting additional samples.
