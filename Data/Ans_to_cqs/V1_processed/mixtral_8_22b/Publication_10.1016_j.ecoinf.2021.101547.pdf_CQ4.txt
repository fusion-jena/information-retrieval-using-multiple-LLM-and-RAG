In the given context, there isn't explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc. However, the text does discuss the use of deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for analyzing satellite imagery. Data augmentation is often employed when working with CNNs to increase the variability of input data and improve model performance.

Data augmentation involves applying various transformations to existing images to create new ones. Commonly used techniques include:

1. Flipping: Images can be horizontally or vertically flipped to generate new samples. This helps the model become invariant to orientation changes.

2. Rotation: Images can be rotated by varying degrees to simulate different viewpoints. This improves the model's ability to recognize objects regardless of their angle.

3. Scaling: Images can be scaled up or down to alter their sizes. This allows the model to better handle variations in object scale during prediction.

4. Translation: Images can be shifted along horizontal or vertical axes to mimic spatial displacement. This enhances the model's robustness against positional shifts.

5. Shearing: Images can undergo shear transformation, distorting them without changing their area. This introduces additional geometric variance into the dataset.

While the exact data augmentation techniques utilized in this particular study aren't mentioned, it's reasonable to assume that one or more of these common techniques could have been implemented to enhance the model's performance.
