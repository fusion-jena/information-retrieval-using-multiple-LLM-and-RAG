The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, it discusses forestry and ecological informatics concepts, including equations for calculating weighted averages and references to NN1 and NN2 estimators. However, without further context, it cannot be determined if NN1 and NN2 refer to neural networks or some other concept within the field of ecological informatics. Therefore, based on the provided context alone, I do not have enough information to determine what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
