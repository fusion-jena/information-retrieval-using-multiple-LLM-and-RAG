The studies mentioned utilize various methods for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipelines. For instance, some researchers use Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or drones equipped with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors to collect High Definition (HD) LiDAR data (Yin & Wang, 2019; Windrim & Bryson, 2020). This method allows for the generation of Canopy Height Models (CHMs) with different spatial resolutions from the LiDAR data (Yin & Wang, 2019). Additionally, other researchers employ satellite remote sensing techniques to gather data, such as multispectral images (Liu & Abd-Elrahman, 2018). Furthermore, some studies leverage publicly available datasets like the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) dataset (Xu et al., 2021). Lastly, ground-based LiDAR data has also been used for data collection purposes (Jin et al., 2018).
