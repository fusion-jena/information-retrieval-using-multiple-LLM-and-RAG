Data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include various transformations applied to the training images. These transformations aim to simulate the deformations that data might experience in real-world scenarios. Some common data augmentation techniques include scaling, rotation, translation, changes in illumination conditions, and cropping parts of the image. The primary goal of data augmentation is to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), making them more effective in handling diverse input data.
