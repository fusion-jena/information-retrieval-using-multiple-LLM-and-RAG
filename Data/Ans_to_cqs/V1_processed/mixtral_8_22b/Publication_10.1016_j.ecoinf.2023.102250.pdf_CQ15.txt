The given context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization technique such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). However, there are some clues about optimization methods used in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, the paper mentions the use of spectral normalization in the discriminator of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. Spectral normalization is a method used to stabilize the training process of GANs by ensuring that the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator remains bounded. It achieves this by constraining the spectral norm of the weight matrices of each layer in the discriminator. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Leaky ReLU activation functions in the convolutional layers of the discriminator. Leaky ReLU is often used as an alternative to traditional ReLU activation functions because it helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation. Overall, while the exact optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the given context, we can infer that spectral normalization and Leaky ReLU activations were employed to improve the stability and efficiency of the training process.
