In the field of freshwater ecology, remote sensing data and water quality parameters are commonly used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, Hong et al. (2022) used hyperspectral imagery to estimate cyanobacteria pigments in the main rivers of South Korea. Similarly, Irons et al. (2012) discussed the use of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission for obtaining remote sensing data. Additionally, Jargal et al. (2023) studied monsoon-induced responses of algal chlorophyll to trophic state, light availability, and morphometry in temperate reservoirs using environmental monitoring data. However, it should be noted that obtaining sufficient and high-quality data from a wide range of reservoirs can be limited by logistical and financial constraints, which can hinder the development of robust and generalized models (Hwang et al., 2003). In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include remote sensing data, water quality parameters, and environmental monitoring data obtained through surveys or sensors. Public datasets may also be available but can vary depending on the specific application and location.
