To ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, I. Grijalva et al. employed several strategies. Firstly, they utilized a diverse dataset consisting of various types of images with different input resolutions (640 x 640 pixels and 1280 x 1280 pixels). This diversity allowed the model to learn from a wide range of examples, improving its ability to perform well on previously unseen data. Secondly, they adopted a stratified splitting approach to divide their dataset into three distinct sets: training, validation, and testing. By maintaining a consistent ratio of 80:10:10 across these sets, they ensured that the distribution of classes remained balanced during both training and evaluation phases. Lastly, they independently trained five different versions of the YOLOv5 model family, namely YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x, to detect alates on sorghum leaves. Training multiple models helped them assess the robustness and consistency of their results, further contributing to the overall generalizability of their study.
