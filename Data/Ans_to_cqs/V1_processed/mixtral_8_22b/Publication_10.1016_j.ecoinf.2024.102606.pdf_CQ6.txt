Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps may be involved depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the model. However, based on the given context, one significant preprocessing step mentioned is data augmentation. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by creating new samples from existing ones. It helps improve the model's ability to generalize and increases its accuracy on the test dataset. In the context of images, various transformations can be applied to create new samples, including but not limited to: Random crop, Mosaic, Color distortions (like brightness, contrast, saturation, hue), Gaussian blur, Random scaling, Random rotation, and Random horizontal flipping. These techniques help recreate the state of old microscope slides on new ones, improving results on old projects. While other common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning aren't explicitly mentioned in the context, these are often necessary steps in preparing data for deep learning models. Normalization scales numeric columns to a standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information, while scaling adjusts the magnitude of the feature to avoid dominance of one feature over others. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data points.
