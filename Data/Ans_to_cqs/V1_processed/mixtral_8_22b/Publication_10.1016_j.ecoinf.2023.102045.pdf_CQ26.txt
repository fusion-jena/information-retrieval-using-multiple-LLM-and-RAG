The given context does not provide specific details regarding the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes within each set. This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the class balance in the dataset. In oversampling, samples from the minority class are duplicated to match the number of samples in the majority class. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves removing samples from the majority class until it matches the size of the minority class. These techniques help improve the performance of models trained on imbalanced datasets.

Finally, diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset represents all relevant scenarios. This helps reduce bias and improves the robustness of the model.
