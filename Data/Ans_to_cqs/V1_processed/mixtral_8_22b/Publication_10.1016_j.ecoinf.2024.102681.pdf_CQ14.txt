The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it mentions that the model was trained using an iterative approach to extract the weights assigned to the fully connected layers. This suggests that some form of optimization or tuning might have been employed during this process. Unfortunately, without more specific details, we cannot definitively state whether techniques such as grid search or random search were utilized for hyperparameter optimization.
