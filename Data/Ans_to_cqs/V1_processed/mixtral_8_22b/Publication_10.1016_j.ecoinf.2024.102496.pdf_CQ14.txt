The text does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Therefore, I cannot determine whether they used methods like grid search or random search.

Based on the given context, it appears that we are discussing a geospatial tool designed to help identify priority locations for implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce water pollutants and improve environmental justice outcomes. However, the context does not mention anything about machine learning models or their optimization techniques, such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning. Thus, I am unable to provide an accurate response regarding the method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
