In the given context, the raw dataset was randomly shuffled before being divided into three distinct subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. Each subset serves a specific purpose in the development and assessment of the deep learning model.

The training set is utilized to teach the model about the underlying patterns within the data. By exposing the model to various input-output pairs, it can gradually learn and update its internal parameters through backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms.

On the other hand, the validation set plays a crucial role in tuning the model's hyperparameters and preventing overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex or specialized to the training data, resulting in poor generalization on unseen data. To mitigate this issue, the validation set is employed to monitor the model's performance throughout the training process and guide the selection of appropriate hyperparameters.

Lastly, the test set is reserved exclusively for evaluating the final model's performance and generalizability. It remains untouched until the completion of the training phase, allowing for an unbiased estimation of how well the model would perform on new, previously unseen data.

Regarding the data partition ratio, the context specifies that the training, validation, and test sets have been allocated in an 8:1:1 proportion. This means that 80% of the available data is dedicated to training, while the remaining 20% is evenly distributed between validation and testing purposes. Furthermore, the random partitioning process is repeated ten times to minimize the impact of chance splits and ensure consistent results across multiple runs.
