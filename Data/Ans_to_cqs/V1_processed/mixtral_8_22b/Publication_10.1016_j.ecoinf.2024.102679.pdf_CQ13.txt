Unfortunately, the given context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the type of optimizer. However, it does mention that the model was trained for 200 epochs during the initial phase and then for another 50 epochs with hard negative patches to improve its performance. It also states that the patch size was set to 1024 x 1024 pixels during inference to speed up the process.
