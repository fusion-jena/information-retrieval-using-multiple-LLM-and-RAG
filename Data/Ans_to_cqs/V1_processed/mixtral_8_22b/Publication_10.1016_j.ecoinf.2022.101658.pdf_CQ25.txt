The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a process where individual pixels in an image are classified according to their category or class. In this case, the deep learning model is being trained to identify different fuel types within ground photographs. The goal is to overcome the challenge posed by high class imbalance and few images, which has been identified as a barrier to performance in studies using semantic segmentation.
