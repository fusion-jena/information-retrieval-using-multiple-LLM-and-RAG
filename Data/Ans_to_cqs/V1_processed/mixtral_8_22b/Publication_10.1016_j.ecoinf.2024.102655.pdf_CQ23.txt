The given context does not provide explicit details about specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention some relevant aspects related to this topic.

In section 2.6, it discusses the issue of using too much data leading to model overtraining and precision loss. This implies that careful consideration was likely given to the selection of training data subsets to avoid such problems. The text also mentions the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality to identify the most variable and representative scenarios for machine learning model training. These points suggest that efforts might have been made to create a diverse dataset for training the model.

Additionally, while the context does not explicitly mention techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, these methods are commonly used to evaluate and enhance the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. Given the focus on improving predictive outputs through better training data selection, it is plausible that similar techniques could have been employed here.

However, without further information, we cannot definitively state which specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
