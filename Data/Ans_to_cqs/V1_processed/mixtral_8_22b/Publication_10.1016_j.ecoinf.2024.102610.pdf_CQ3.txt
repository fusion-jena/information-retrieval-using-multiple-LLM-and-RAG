The paper by Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) discusses various machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases but does not specifically mention any data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Similarly, Khun (2022) provides information on classification and regression training using the package 'caret,' but it also does not provide details about data annotation techniques. The study by Laaksonen et al. (2017) focuses on crowdsourced tick collections and their association with pathogens in Finland, which is unrelated to the topic of data annotation techniques in deep learning pipelines. None of these sources directly address the query regarding specific data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine what data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
