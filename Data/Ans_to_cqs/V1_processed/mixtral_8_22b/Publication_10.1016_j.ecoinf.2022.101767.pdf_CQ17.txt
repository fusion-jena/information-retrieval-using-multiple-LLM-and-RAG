The provided sources do not directly discuss regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, they do mention the use of a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest Analysis in the study. While Random Forest is not a regularization method itself, it can help reduce overfitting due to its ensemble nature, combining multiple decision trees to create a more robust model. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are techniques specifically designed for neural networks, which are not mentioned in the given sources. Dropout involves randomly dropping out nodes during training to prevent complex co-adaptations, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights, thus reducing complexity and preventing overfitting.
