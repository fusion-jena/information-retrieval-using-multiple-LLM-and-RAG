Unfortunately, there isn't any information available regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer about whether GPUs or TPUs were employed during the training process. However, typically, deep learning models like YOLOv8 would benefit from using powerful hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs to accelerate the training process.
