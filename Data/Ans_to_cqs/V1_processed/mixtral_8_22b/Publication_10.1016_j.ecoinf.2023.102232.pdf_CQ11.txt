Unfortunately, I cannot provide the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline since it was not mentioned or specified in the provided context. However, according to the information given, the scripts and datasets used to reproduce the results of this work can be found at <https://github.com/lucaros1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo>. This GitHub repository contains the necessary resources related to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and hybrid Genetic Algorithm used in the research. Please note that this does not necessarily contain the deep learning pipeline, but rather the materials relevant to the computational methods employed in the study.
