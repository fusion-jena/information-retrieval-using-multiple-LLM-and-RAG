In this study, the deep learning model used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The hyperparameters used for the CNN include a batch size of 32 images, a cross-entropy loss function, and the Adam learning rate optimizer. The initial learning rate was set to 1e-03, but it was automatically adjusted during training using the Adam optimizer. Each model was initially set to train for a maximum of 100 epochs, but early stopping was implemented if the validation error did not decrease for 10 consecutive epochs. This resulted in different numbers of epochs for each dataset: 14, 14, and 23 epochs for datasets 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
