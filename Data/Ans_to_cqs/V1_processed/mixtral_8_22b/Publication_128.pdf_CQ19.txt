Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was built using the TensorFlow framework. Specifically, version 1.12.0 of TensorFlow was utilized in conjunction with Python version 3.6.2. Additionally, other tool packages such as NumPy were also used within the virtual environment. However, there is no mention of any other deep learning frameworks being used besides TensorFlow. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, it can be concluded that TensorFlow was the primary framework used to build the deep learning model.
