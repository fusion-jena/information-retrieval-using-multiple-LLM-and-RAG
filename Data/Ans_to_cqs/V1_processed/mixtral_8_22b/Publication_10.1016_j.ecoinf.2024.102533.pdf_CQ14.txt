Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it can be inferred that some form of optimization was performed during the machine learning experiments mentioned in the text. Specifically, the researchers utilized 2 to 10 clusters to find the appropriate number of freshness clusters for each species, which suggests they tested various configurations to determine the optimal number of clusters. Furthermore, the use of the elbow method to evaluate the number of classes and their duration indicates that they sought to minimize subjectivity and enhance the objectivity of their findings by selecting the best configuration. Nevertheless, without specific details about the optimization techniques used, it cannot be definitively stated whether grid search, random search, or another method was applied.
