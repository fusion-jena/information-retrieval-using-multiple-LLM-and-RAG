The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it discusses the application of the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model for continuous bioacoustic monitoring of bird species. This model likely has its own methods for handling randomness during training or prediction processes, but these details are not covered in the given information.
