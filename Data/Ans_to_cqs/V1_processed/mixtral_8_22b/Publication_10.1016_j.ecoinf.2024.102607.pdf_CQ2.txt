The research primarily focuses on remote sensing (RS) imagery for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. Specifically, they utilize Landsat-8 satellite data obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. They select six bands from this data: blue, green, red, near-infrared, and two shortwave infrared bands. Additionally, they employ the quality assurance (QA) band to identify and remove clouds and shadows. Therefore, the primary data format used in their deep learning pipeline is RS imagery. However, there is also mention of incorporating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in future studies, which typically work with image data. There is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being used in their current or planned deep learning pipelines.
