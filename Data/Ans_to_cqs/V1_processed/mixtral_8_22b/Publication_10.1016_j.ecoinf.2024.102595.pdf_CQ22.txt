Two primary metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this study: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 score (also known as coefficient of determination).

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common metric used in regression problems to measure the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Lower MSE values indicate better model performance. In this study, MSE values varied among the tested models, ranging from approximately 1001 to over 1100.

The R^2 score, also called the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by independent variables in the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the model perfectly fits the data. In this study, R^2 scores varied among the models, with some reaching around 0.6 and others falling below 0.55.

These two metrics provide insights into the overall performance of the deep learning models in predicting oil palm yields. However, it should be noted that while higher R^2 scores and lower MSE values generally indicate better model performance, there may still be room for improvement due to factors such as overfitting or limitations in the dataset.
