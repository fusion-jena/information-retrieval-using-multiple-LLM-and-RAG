Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it discusses the application of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of recurrent neural network commonly used for processing sequential data like time series data. The LSTM model is known for its ability to handle long-term dependencies and multivariate time series data, making it suitable for solving prediction problems related to time series data. Additionally, the context mentions the comparison between the LSTM model and other models like the Backpropagation (BP) model and the Markov Chain model. It also briefly touches upon optimizing land allocation using a Multiobjective Programming (MOP) model combined with uncertainty analysis methods. Unfortunately, without further information regarding the specifics of the deep learning pipeline employed in this research, I cannot provide details about the data augmentation techniques used.
