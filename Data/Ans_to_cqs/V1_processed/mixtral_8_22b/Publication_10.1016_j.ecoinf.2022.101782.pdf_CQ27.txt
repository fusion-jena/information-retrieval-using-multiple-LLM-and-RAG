The text does not provide explicit information about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, some details can be inferred. The model was trained using TensorFlow, an open-source platform for machine learning, and Keras, a user-friendly neural network library built on top of TensorFlow. After training, the best model was selected based on minimum validation loss, occurring at epoch 448. This suggests that the model was saved during training, possibly through checkpointing or callbacks, common practices in TensorFlow and Keras. Unfortunately, there are no specifics regarding model serialization or platform selection for deployment.
