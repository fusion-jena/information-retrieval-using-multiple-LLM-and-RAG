The paper does not provide information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It only mentions that the study analyzed AGB estimation based on field data and predicted it using remotely sensed optical and SAR datasets and machine learning models such as RF, ANN, and SVM. Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
