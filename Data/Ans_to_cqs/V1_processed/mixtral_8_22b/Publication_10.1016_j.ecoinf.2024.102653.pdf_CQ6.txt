Unfortunately, there isn't any explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in the given context. However, it does mention that the model uses two distinct validation methodologies, one of which involves partitioning the dataset into training and validation sets. It also mentions that the model's weights were randomly initialized using a specific integer seed to ensure consistent reproducibility of results. Furthermore, it states that meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted to achieve optimal model performance. These hyperparameters, which yielded the best performance metrics, are presented in Table 1. Therefore, while we cannot provide specific details on the preprocessing steps, we can infer that some form of data preparation and manipulation likely occurred prior to training the model.
