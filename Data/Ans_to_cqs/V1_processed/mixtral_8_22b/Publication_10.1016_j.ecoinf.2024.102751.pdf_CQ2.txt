The study primarily uses two types of data formats in its deep learning pipeline - high-resolution topographic data from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and spectral information from PlanetScope imagery. The ALS data provides detailed topographic features like slope, aspect, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), while the PlanetScope imagery offers multispectral satellite images. These datasets are likely used in their raw format or preprocessed into suitable formats compatible with the deep learning models employed in this research. However, it should be noted that the specific file formats (like.csv,.png, etc.) are not explicitly mentioned in the given context.
