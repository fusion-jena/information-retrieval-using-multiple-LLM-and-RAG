The context does not provide explicit information regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to randomly divide the dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. Typically, the training set comprises around 60-80% of the total data, while the remaining data is divided equally between the validation and testing sets. This division allows the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training, validate its performance using the validation set, and finally evaluate its generalization capabilities on unseen data using the testing set. It should also be noted that the specific proportions may vary depending on factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the task, and the desired balance between bias and variance.
