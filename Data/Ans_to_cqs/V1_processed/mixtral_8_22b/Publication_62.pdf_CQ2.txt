The deep learning pipeline described in this study uses images as its primary data format. This is evident from the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are specifically designed for processing grid-like topology data such as images. Furthermore, the tables detailing the constitutive layers and tensor/vector shapes for the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN both indicate that the input data is a three-dimensional tensor, which is typically associated with RGB images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline are primarily images.
