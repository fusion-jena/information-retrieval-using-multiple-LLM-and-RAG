To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, several measures were implemented. Firstly, diverse datasets were utilized, including meteorological data, remote sensing data, and socioeconomic data. These datasets covered various aspects of the study area, providing comprehensive information for training the models. Secondly, cross-validation was employed during the training process. Specifically, k-fold cross-validation was adopted, where the original sample was randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, one subsample was retained as the validation data for testing the model, while the remaining kâˆ’1 subsamples were used as training data. This process was then repeated k times, with each of the k subsamples being used exactly once as the validation data. Lastly, stratified sampling was also considered when dividing the dataset into training and test sets. This method ensured that both sets had similar distributions of labels, preventing any bias towards certain classes or categories. By implementing these measures, the robustness and reliability of the deep learning models could be improved, ensuring their applicability across different scenarios and conditions.
