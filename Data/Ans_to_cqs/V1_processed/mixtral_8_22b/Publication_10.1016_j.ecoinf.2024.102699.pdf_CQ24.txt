The text does not provide explicit information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, some insights can be drawn from the use of data augmentation techniques mentioned in the given context. Data augmentation is a strategy used to increase the amount of training data by applying random modifications or transformations to existing data. These techniques help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.

In the given context, several data augmentation techniques have been employed for the classification of birdsongs within natural soundscapes. Some examples include mixing up random bird species, horizontal and vertical rolls, spectrogram augmentation methods, and adding weighted noise samples extracted from audio chunks without bird events. While these techniques do not directly address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they introduce controlled variability into the dataset, allowing the model to learn more effectively from diverse patterns and variations.

Moreover, the iterative selection process described in the context suggests that only those augmentations that enhance classification performance are chosen. This approach helps ensure that the introduced randomness contributes positively to the model's overall performance rather than negatively affecting it.

Although the text does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness related to specific aspects like random seed values, employing data augmentation techniques introduces controlled variability into the dataset, helping the model better manage randomness and improving its ability to generalize.
