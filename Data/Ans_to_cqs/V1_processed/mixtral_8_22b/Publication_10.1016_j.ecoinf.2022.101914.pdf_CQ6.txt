The provided context does not directly discuss the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention some relevant steps taken prior to building models. These include obtaining presence and generating background points, separating data into folds, setting aside one fold for external evaluation, performing scale optimization for environmental covariates, subsampling background points, and training component models separately using each background point subsample. While these steps may not be considered traditional preprocessing techniques for deep learning models, they do represent important preparatory work done before constructing and evaluating models. It should also be noted that the type of preprocessing required often depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model being trained. Therefore, without more information about the specific deep learning model and its input data, it would be difficult to provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps.
