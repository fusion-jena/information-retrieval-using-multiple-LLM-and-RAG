The text does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, common practices include splitting the dataset randomly or stratified based on class labels, using a fixed percentage such as 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, or employing techniques like k-fold cross-validation. It is essential to ensure that the splits maintain the same distribution as the original dataset to avoid introducing bias during the training process.
