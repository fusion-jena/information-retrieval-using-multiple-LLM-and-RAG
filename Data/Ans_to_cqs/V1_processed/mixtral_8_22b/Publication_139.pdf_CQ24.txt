Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred from the text that the authors use a cross-validation technique called "five training folds" to generate multiple prediction records. These records are then averaged together to create a single prediction record. This method could potentially mitigate some effects of randomness introduced by different initializations of weights in the neural network model. Additionally, when generating the final prediction record, the authors normalize the data by accounting for missing audio data, ensuring that any potential gaps do not skew the results. While these techniques help address issues related to variability in the dataset, they do not directly tackle the problem of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline due to factors like random seed values.
