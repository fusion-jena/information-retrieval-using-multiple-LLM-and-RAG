The papers cited do not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they mention some relevant concepts related to handling imbalanced datasets in species distribution modeling.

In the context of these studies, one common approach to dealing with imbalanced data is using machine learning algorithms like Maxent, which can handle imbalanced datasets effectively. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the R package ENMeval to detect the optimal Maxent settings for modeling current distributions. This suggests that careful parameter selection plays a crucial role in improving the reliability of species predictions when working with imbalanced data.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the given context, other commonly used techniques for addressing data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These methods aim to balance the dataset by either increasing the number of underrepresented samples or reducing the number of overrepresented ones. Stratified sampling ensures that each class is represented proportionally in the training and testing sets. In contrast, oversampling involves duplicating minority class examples, while undersampling removes majority class instances. Collecting more diverse data can also help mitigate data bias by ensuring better representation of all classes in the dataset.
