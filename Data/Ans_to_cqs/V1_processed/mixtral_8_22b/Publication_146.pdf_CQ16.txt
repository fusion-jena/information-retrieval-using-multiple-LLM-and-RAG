Based on the provided context, it appears that the model was trained for a fixed number of epochs rather than using specific criteria to determine when training is complete. The model was trained for a total of 350 epochs, which resulted in a total training time of 27 hours. However, there is no mention of any specific criteria used to determine when training should stop, such as a validation loss plateau or reaching a certain level of performance on a validation dataset. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that the decision to train for 350 epochs was made beforehand and not based on any particular stopping criterion.
