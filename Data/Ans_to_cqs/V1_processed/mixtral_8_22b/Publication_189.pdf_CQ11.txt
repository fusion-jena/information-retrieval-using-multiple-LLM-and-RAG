The given context does not provide information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific link to resources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF based on the available information. Further details would be required to accurately identify the relevant data repository link.

Based on the provided context, we can only infer that the system was implemented using TensorFlow version 1.14.0 and Keras version 2.2.4 alongside Python 3.6. It utilized ResNet 50 and ResNet 101 as backbone structures and employed anchor boxes of ratios 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. However, there is no mention of any links to data repositories containing the deep learning pipeline or related datasets.
