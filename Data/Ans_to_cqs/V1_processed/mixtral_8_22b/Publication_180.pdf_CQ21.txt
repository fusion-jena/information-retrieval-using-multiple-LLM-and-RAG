The text does not provide explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps used after training the TensorFlow models. However, based on common practices in machine learning projects, several general postprocessing steps can be suggested. These may include evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. A confusion matrix could also be generated to visualize the classification errors made by the model. Additionally, techniques like saliency maps might have been employed to understand how the model makes its predictions by highlighting important features in the input images. Nevertheless, without further details, these suggestions remain speculative.
