The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the model is likely being used for image classification tasks. This is because the authors mention using the ResNext-101 model, which is known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. Furthermore, they discuss using the model for recognizing empty camera trap images, which suggests that the model is classifying images as either containing animals or being empty. Additionally, the authors use terms such as 'loss value', 'optimizer', and 'hyper-parameter settings', which are commonly associated with training deep learning models for classification tasks.
