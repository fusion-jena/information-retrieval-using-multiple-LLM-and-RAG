Based on the given context, it does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, typically, the data is divided into three sets: training set, validation set, and testing set. The training set is used to fit the model, while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Lastly, the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. The division ratio can vary depending on the size of the dataset but commonly ranges between 60-80% for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing.
