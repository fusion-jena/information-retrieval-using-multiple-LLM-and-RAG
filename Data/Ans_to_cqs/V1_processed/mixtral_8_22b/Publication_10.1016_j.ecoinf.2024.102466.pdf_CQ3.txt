The authors utilized two main data annotation techniques in their deep learning pipeline. The first technique involved using a pre-trained object detection model, specifically YOLO v7, to perform initial image labeling. This state-of-the-art detection method was trained on bird camera tapping datasets to predict the frames, analyze the structure, and identify the positions of potential birds within the images.

Following the initial labeling with YOLO v7, the second technique applied was further processing of the data annotations using LabelImg. This tool allowed for adjustments to the boundaries and classes of bird species based on the labels detected by YOLO v7. During this stage, incorrect identifications were manually removed, and detection coordinates were fine-tuned to ensure accurate annotations.

These two techniques combined enabled the creation of a comprehensive dataset containing 9717 images of 15 wild bird species captured by camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. This dataset served as the foundation for evaluating eight deep learning algorithms for bird object detection and assessing their performance.
