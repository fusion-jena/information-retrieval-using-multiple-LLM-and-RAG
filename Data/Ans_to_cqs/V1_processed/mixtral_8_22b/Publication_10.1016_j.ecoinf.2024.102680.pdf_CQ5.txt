Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline within the given context. Therefore, I am unable to provide a direct answer to your query regarding the use of datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It would be best to refer back to the source material or consult additional resources for further clarification.
