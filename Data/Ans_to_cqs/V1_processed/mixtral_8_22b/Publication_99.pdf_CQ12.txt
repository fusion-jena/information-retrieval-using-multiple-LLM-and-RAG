In the given context, three types of deep learning models are mentioned: PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks. These models are all based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are widely used for image processing tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.

PConv networks are partial convolutions designed to handle irregularly shaped inputs or missing regions in images. They use a masking scheme to ignore the invalid pixels during the convolution operation.

Pix2Pix networks are generative adversarial networks (GANs) specifically designed for image-to-image translation tasks. They consist of a generator network and a discriminator network, where the generator tries to produce realistic output images, and the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and fake images.

Classification networks are CNNs used for classifying images into specific categories. In this case, they are used for identifying plant species. The context mentions adapting the VGG16 network, a popular CNN architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, for this purpose.

Therefore, the pipeline uses CNN-based deep learning models, including PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and classification networks.
