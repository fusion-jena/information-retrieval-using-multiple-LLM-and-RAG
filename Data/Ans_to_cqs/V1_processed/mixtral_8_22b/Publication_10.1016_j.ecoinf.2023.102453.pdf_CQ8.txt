Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available in the given context. It does not specify whether the code is hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or elsewhere. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided text.
