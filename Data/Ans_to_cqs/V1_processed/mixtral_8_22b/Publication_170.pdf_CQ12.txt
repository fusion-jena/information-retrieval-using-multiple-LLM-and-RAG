The deep learning model used in this study is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, it uses the AlexNet model, which includes five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. Each layer performs Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing, except for the last fully connected layer. Additionally, the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers perform a downsampling operation using the mean pooling method.
