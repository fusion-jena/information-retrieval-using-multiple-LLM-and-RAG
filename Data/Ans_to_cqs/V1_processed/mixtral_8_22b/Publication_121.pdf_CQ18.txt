To monitor the model performance during training, the authors employed two strategies: tracking training and validation accuracy. They utilized graphs to visualize the progression of these metrics over time. Specifically, they plotted the training and validation accuracy of their transfer learned models based on MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 architectures (as shown in Fig. 2). Similarly, they tracked the training and validation accuracy of their fine-tuned models based on the same architectures (as depicted in Fig. 3). By observing these graphs, one can assess how well the models are performing and whether they are improving or deteriorating over time. This information is crucial for making informed decisions about adjusting hyperparameters, modifying the architecture, or even stopping the training process if necessary.
