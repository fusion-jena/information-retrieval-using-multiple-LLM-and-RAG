The provided context does not contain information about the specific process used to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, common practices for deploying machine learning models include model serialization, platform selection, and version control. Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be easily stored and transferred, such as a binary file or a JSON object. This allows the model to be saved and loaded quickly without having to retrain it each time it is needed. Platform selection refers to choosing the appropriate environment or system for running the deployed model, which could be a cloud service like AWS or Google Cloud, or a local server. Version control is important for tracking changes made to the model over time and ensuring consistency across different versions of the model. It also helps with collaboration among team members working on the same project.
