The given context does not provide information about specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to handle data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse data.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes or labels in both sets. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of each class.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the number of samples in each class to balance the dataset. In oversampling, additional copies of minority class examples are added to the dataset, while in undersampling, majority class examples are removed from the dataset.

Collecting diverse data involves gathering data from various sources and ensuring that it represents all possible scenarios and variations. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalization ability of the model.

Again, please note that the given context does not mention any of these techniques specifically.
