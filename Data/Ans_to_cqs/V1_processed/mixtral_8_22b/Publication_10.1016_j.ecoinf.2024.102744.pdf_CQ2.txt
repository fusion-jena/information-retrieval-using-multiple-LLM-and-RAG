The given context does not explicitly mention the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred from the context that the primary focus is on image data. The text discusses various aspects related to image processing and analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), such as feature extraction, dropout layers, global average pooling, and fully connected layers. Furthermore, there are references to pre-training models like AlexNet, DenseNet-201, GoogLeNet, ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, and VGG-19 on the ImageNet dataset, which consists mainly of images. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data.
