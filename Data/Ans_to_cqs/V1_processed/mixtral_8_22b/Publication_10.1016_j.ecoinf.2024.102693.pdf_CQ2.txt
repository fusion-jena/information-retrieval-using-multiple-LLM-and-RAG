Based on the given context, it appears that the focus is primarily on image data within the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context discusses various models such as ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7, all of which are designed for processing images or image patches. However, the context does not explicitly mention other types of data formats like audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, we can infer that the primary data format used in these deep learning pipelines is image data.
