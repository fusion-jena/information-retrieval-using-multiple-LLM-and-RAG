The given context does not provide information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine what specific data formats such as images, audio, video, or CSV files were utilized in this case.

Based on the available context, it appears that the study focuses on analyzing and comparing various methods for predicting intensity distributions using lasso regularization and bias correction techniques. These methods include knn, LoopT, LoopA, CoinF, kmeans, random, LoopE, and others. The performance of these methods was evaluated based on their ability to accurately classify and predict intensity distributions, as shown in figures 1 through 6.

However, there is no mention of any specific data format being used in this analysis. It could be possible that the input data consists of numerical values stored in a structured format such as CSV, but without further context, it is impossible to confirm this assumption.
