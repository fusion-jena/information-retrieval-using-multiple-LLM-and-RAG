The given context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, these are common preprocessing techniques used for preparing datasets before feeding them into machine learning models like deep learning algorithms. Normalization involves rescaling values to fit within a certain range, often between 0 and 1, which helps prevent features with larger scales from dominating those with smaller ones. Scaling adjusts the range of feature values without altering their distribution, while cleaning removes noise, outliers, missing values, and irrelevant data from the dataset.
