Based on the given context, there is no direct information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as managing random seed values. However, it can be inferred that the authors have taken steps to address variability in their results by using multiple iterations and reporting average performance metrics with confidence intervals. Specifically, they mention using 20 random iterations for each feature type and distance category when evaluating classification accuracy. This suggests that they may have incorporated some form of randomization or shuffling in their dataset during these iterations. Additionally, they report the mean and standard deviation of classification accuracy across these iterations, providing insight into the stability and consistency of their models' performance. While this does not directly address the management of random seeds, it demonstrates an awareness of the need to account for variability in deep learning pipelines.
