The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques used in image processing include flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, translation, and color space transformations. These techniques help increase the size of training datasets and improve the generalization ability of deep learning models. It is likely that similar techniques could have been employed in the studies mentioned in the context, but without explicit information, it cannot be confirmed which specific techniques were used.
