Based on the given context, there isn't any explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the model training process determines the values for the trainable parameters of a model, such as the size of the model parameters. Additionally, it discusses the concept of hyperparameter optimization, where certain non-trainable parameters like learning rate, batch size, and dropout are adjusted to improve model performance. This suggests that monitoring the model performance during training might involve tracking metrics related to these hyperparameters or observing changes in the trainable parameters over time. But without specific details, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.
