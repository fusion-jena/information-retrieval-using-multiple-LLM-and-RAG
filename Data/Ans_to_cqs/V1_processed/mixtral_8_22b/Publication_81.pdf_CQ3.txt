The given abstract does not provide any specific details about the use of data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the proposed ESK model uses DNA barcode sequences to classify fish from different families and identify outliers. This suggests that the input data for the model consists of DNA sequences rather than images, so traditional image annotation techniques like bounding boxes or instance segmentation would not be applicable here. Instead, the focus seems to be on processing and analyzing sequencing data using deep learning models.
