Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some relevant information can still be extracted.

Firstly, it is mentioned that Random Forest is used as the baseline model. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees and aggregating their results. It helps reduce overfitting and improve prediction accuracy. Although not directly addressing data bias, using such methods can help mitigate its effects indirectly.

Secondly, the text mentions that candidate logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated via (1) random cross-validation (CV) and (2) spatial CV. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and prevent overfitting. In random CV, the dataset is randomly divided into k subsets or 'folds', where one fold serves as the test set and the remaining kâˆ’1 folds form the training set. This process is repeated k times, ensuring every observation has been part of the test set once. Spatial CV, on the other hand, involves dividing the dataset based on spatial criteria rather than purely random assignment. Both these approaches can help ensure that the trained model generalizes well across various parts of the input space, thus reducing any potential biases introduced due to uneven representation of certain classes or regions within the dataset.

Lastly, the table lists several features used in the analysis, including BIO03, TN10P, GSL, TNX, BIO08, TXX, BIO02, TN90P, ID, BIO14, BIO18, CWD, RX1DAY, WSDI, and others. These features likely represent various environmental variables or characteristics that could influence species distributions. By carefully selecting and engineering appropriate features, researchers can potentially minimize the impact of data bias on their models.

However, without more detailed information about the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific techniques employed to address data bias.
