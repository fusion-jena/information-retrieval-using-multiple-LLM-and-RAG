The text does not provide explicit details about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it mentions the use of massive training datasets and cautions that machine learning methods are limited by the quality of both imagery and training data. This suggests that the authors might have considered factors such as dataset size, image quality, and variability when splitting the data. It would be best to refer to the original research paper or contact the authors for precise information on the criteria used for data splitting.
