Based on the given information, there isn't explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing was done since the table shows accuracy results for both raw and preprocessed datasets. Typically, preprocessing steps may include image rescaling, normalization, augmentation, noise removal, among others. In this case, the authors mentioned that the preprocessing stage reduces noises and standardizes inputs, but they did not specify what exact techniques were used.
