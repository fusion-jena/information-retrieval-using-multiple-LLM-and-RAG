Based on the given context, it appears there isn't enough information to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help label datasets for tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. Without more details regarding the dataset or task, I cannot provide a definitive answer on which technique was used in this case.
