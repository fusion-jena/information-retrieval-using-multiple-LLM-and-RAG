Unfortunately, the given context does not provide information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer based solely on the provided text. However, some common postprocessing steps include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., creating confusion matrices, generating saliency maps, and performing other forms of analysis to evaluate the model's performance and interpret its predictions.
