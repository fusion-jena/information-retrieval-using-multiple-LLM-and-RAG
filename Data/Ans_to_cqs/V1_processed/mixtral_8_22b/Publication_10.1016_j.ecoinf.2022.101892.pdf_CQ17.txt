The authors mention several techniques to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline. One method they employ is aggressive data augmentation, which involves applying various transformations to the input images, such as horizontal flipping, to create new training examples. This helps improve the generalizability of the model by exposing it to more diverse inputs. Another approach used to mitigate overfitting is replacing the last three fully connected layers of the original VGG model with one fully connected layer. By reducing the number of parameters, this modification can help prevent the model from memorizing the training data. Additionally, batch normalization is adopted to stabilize the learning process and accelerate the training of networks. While specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization are not explicitly mentioned, these techniques could also be employed alongside the described approaches to further enhance the robustness of the model against overfitting.
