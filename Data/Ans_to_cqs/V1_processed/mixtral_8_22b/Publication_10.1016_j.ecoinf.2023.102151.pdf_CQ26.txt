While the provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, some general principles can be applied. Data bias can occur when certain classes or features are overrepresented or underrepresented in the dataset, leading to poor performance of the deep learning models. To mitigate this issue, various techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in each set. This ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of all classes.

Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the number of samples in each class to achieve balance. In oversampling, additional copies of minority class examples are added to the dataset, whereas in undersampling, majority class examples are removed until balance is achieved. These techniques help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection refers to collecting data from different sources, environments, and conditions to ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of scenarios. This helps improve its ability to generalize and perform well on unseen data.

In summary, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. By employing these techniques, one can improve the performance and reliability of their deep learning models.
