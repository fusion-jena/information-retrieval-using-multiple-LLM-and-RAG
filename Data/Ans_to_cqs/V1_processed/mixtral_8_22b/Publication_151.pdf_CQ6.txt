The text does not provide explicit information about any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, some common preprocessing techniques used in deep learning include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves rescaling the input features so that they have a mean of zero and unit variance. Scaling adjusts the range of values of input features to prevent certain features from dominating others due to their scale. Cleaning refers to handling missing or inconsistent data points, such as removing outliers or imputing missing values. These preprocessing steps help improve the performance and convergence rate of the deep learning model during training.
