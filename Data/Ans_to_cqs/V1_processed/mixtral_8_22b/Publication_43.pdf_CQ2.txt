The provided context primarily discusses the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet and GoogLeNet for image classification tasks. These networks are typically trained using image datasets, where each image is associated with its respective class label. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. However, the context does not explicitly mention any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files being utilized in the discussed deep learning pipelines.
