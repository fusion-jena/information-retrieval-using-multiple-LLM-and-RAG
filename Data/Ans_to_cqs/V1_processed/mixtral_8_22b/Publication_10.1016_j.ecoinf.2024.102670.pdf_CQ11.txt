Unfortunately, based on the given information, there isn't any explicit mention or reference to a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this case. The sources mentioned primarily discuss various aspects such as utilizing crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotations, examining network data, optimizing the angular branching process in fungal growth, and visualizing network structures. However, none of these directly provide a link to a data repository containing the deep learning pipeline itself. Therefore, without additional context or information, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
