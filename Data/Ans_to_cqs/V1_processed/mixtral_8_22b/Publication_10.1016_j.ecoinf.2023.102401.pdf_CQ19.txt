The text does not provide explicit information about the specific deep learning framework used to build the YWnet model. However, it mentions that the model was trained on hardware servers capable of training deep learning models, implying that popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch could have been employed. These frameworks offer tools and libraries that facilitate building, training, and evaluating deep learning models. Without additional context, it cannot be definitively stated which framework was used for developing the YWnet model.
