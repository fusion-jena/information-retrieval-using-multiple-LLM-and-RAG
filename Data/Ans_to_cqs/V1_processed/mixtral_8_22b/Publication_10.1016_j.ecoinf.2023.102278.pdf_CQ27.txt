Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available to provide a detailed response about the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, I can infer some general steps typically involved in such processes.

After training a deep learning model, the next step usually involves saving or serializing the model so that it can be used later for prediction or inference. This often includes saving the model's architecture, its learned weights, and any additional metadata required to load and use the model.

Once the model is saved, it needs to be deployed onto a platform suitable for running predictions. Depending on the application requirements, this could range from edge devices like mobile phones or IoT devices, to cloud servers, or even high-performance computing clusters.

In many cases, the choice of platform depends on factors such as computational resources needed, latency requirements, data privacy concerns, and cost considerations. For instance, if real-time predictions are necessary, a powerful local device might be preferred over a remote server due to lower network latencies. On the other hand, if large amounts of data need processing, a scalable cloud solution may be more appropriate.

However, without specific details regarding the deployment strategy employed in this case, these remain speculative suggestions.
