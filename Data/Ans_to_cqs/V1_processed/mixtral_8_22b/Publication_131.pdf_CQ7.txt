The data was split into two sets: training and testing. The training set consisted of 80% of the samples, while the remaining 20% were used for testing. To ensure a balanced sampling for the test set, one audio sample (along with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of every five was selected for each type of anuran call. As a result, 7623 samples were utilized for training, and 1892 samples were employed for testing. No specific mention was made regarding a separate validation set.
