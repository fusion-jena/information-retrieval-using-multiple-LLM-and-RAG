Based on the given context, it appears that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using Cluster Analysis (CA) and Time Series Analysis with Water Quality Index (TSAWQI) techniques. These methods help identify trends in historical data and select those providing greater variability for predictive model training. Specifically, the use of reduced amounts of data composed of the most representative scenarios improved the prediction performance of the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model. Furthermore, the data reduction did not significantly impact Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, as only a slight decrease in evaluation measurements was observed when BTS was used, despite containing less than 50% of the full dataset. Therefore, it can be concluded that the strategy employed to monitor the model performance during training involved selecting the most relevant data subsets for training, which led to improved prediction accuracy without requiring extensive datasets.
