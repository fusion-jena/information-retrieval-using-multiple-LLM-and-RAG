The given context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses various aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), such as shortcut connections, bottleneck architecture, global average pooling (GAP), and skip connections. It also mentions different pre-trained networks like EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3.

Regarding data annotation techniques, they are crucial steps in developing machine learning models, especially those involving computer vision tasks. Common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, polygon annotation, key point annotation, and landmark annotation. These techniques help train models to identify objects or regions of interest within images accurately.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing rectangles around objects of interest in an image. Semantic segmentation entails assigning each pixel in an image to a class or category. Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation, identifying individual instances of objects while also providing their boundaries. Polygon annotation uses irregular shapes to outline complex objects or structures. Key point annotation marks specific points on an object, often used for facial recognition or pose estimation. Landmark annotation identifies significant features or reference points in an image.

Without explicit mention of the data annotation techniques employed in the described deep learning pipeline, we cannot definitively state which methods were used. Nonetheless, understanding common data annotation techniques can aid in interpreting how the mentioned pre-trained networks might have been trained and applied in the given context.
