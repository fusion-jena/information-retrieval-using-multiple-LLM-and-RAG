Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be taken to improve its performance. These may include data normalization, which scales numeric variables to a common range or mean; data cleaning, where missing values, outliers, or irrelevant features are removed or handled appropriately; and feature engineering, where new features are created based on existing ones to better capture patterns in the data. Additionally, data augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, or cropping images can help increase the size and diversity of datasets for image classification tasks. It is also essential to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting.
