The given context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it mentions that the mainstream deep learning approach for sound recognition involves mapping the sound amplitude onto a 2-D mel-scale spectrogram and using a modified network architecture adapted from advanced image recognition for automatic feature learning. This suggests that the data preprocessing step might involve transforming audio signals into spectrogram images, which could be considered a form of data annotation. Nevertheless, without further details regarding the specific data annotation techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
