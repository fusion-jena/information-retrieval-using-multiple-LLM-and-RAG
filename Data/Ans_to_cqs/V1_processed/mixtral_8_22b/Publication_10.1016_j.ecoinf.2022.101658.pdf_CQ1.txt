The study utilizes field measurements and ground photographs for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. The field measurements involve collecting data at three field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK). These measurements include estimating overstory composition for each transect and calculating fuel loads for each Fine Woody Debris (FWD) size class using a specific formula. Additionally, ground photographs are captured using exposure settings that enable distributed data collection of nadir photographs by personnel working at different times of the day and using various brands of smartphones. The potential long-term implication of this research includes developing a smartphone-based application to estimate percent ground cover and surface biomass loadings in forest ecosystems rapidly and automatically.
