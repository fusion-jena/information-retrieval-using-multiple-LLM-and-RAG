The provided context does not directly address the query about what metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, I can still provide some information regarding common evaluation metrics used in deep learning models.

Deep learning models are typically evaluated using various metrics depending on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.) and the dataset characteristics. Some commonly used evaluation metrics for classification tasks include:

1. Accuracy: It measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of instances. While widely used, accuracy might not always be the best metric, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

2. Precision: Also known as Positive Predictive Value (PPV), precision measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. High precision indicates fewer false positives.

3. Recall (Sensitivity): Measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. High recall means fewer false negatives.

4. F1 Score: It combines both precision and recall by calculating their harmonic mean. F1 score provides a better measure of the incorrectly classified cases than accuracy.

5. Area Under Curve (AUC-ROC): ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, which plots True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate. AUC-ROC represents the degree of separability between classes. Higher values indicate better class separation.

For regression problems, common evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R^2 Score (coefficient of determination), and others. These metrics help assess how well the model predicts continuous target variables.
