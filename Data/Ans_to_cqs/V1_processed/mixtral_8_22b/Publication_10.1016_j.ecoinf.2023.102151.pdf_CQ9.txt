The given context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, based on the provided context alone, we cannot determine which platform hosts the data repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF). Further research or additional information is required to accurately identify the location of the data repository.
