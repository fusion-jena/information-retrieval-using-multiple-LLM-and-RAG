The provided context does not contain information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate response based solely on the given context. Typically, the dataset is divided into three parts: training set, validation set, and testing set. The division ratio depends on various factors like the size of the dataset, its complexity, and the problem statement. Commonly, the dataset is divided into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. However, these ratios may vary depending on the specific use case.
