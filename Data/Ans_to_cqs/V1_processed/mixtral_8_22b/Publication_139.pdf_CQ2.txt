The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses spectrograms, which are pictorial representations of raw audio data. These spectrograms are essentially images that convey temporal dimensions horizontally and frequency vertically, with the third dimension, sound power level, being represented through color. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data. This allows for the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are designed for image classification tasks, to accurately classify various sounds present in the audio recordings.
