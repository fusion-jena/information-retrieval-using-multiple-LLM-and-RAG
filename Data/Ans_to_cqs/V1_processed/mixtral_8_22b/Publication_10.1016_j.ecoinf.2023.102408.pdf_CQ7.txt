Based on the given context, it does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and testing set.

The training set is used to train the model, where the model learns patterns and relationships between features and target variables. The validation set is used during the training process to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The testing set is used after the model has been trained and validated to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Commonly, the dataset is split into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. However, the exact ratio may vary depending on the size of the dataset and the problem being solved. In some cases, cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation may be used instead of splitting the dataset into fixed subsets.

It should be noted that the context mentions the use of hyperparameters such as "mtry" and "ntree" in the random forest algorithm, which suggests that the authors likely considered the importance of proper data partitioning and avoiding overfitting. Additionally, the context discusses the use of regularization parameters to avoid overfitting in artificial neural networks, further indicating the authors' awareness of the need for appropriate data splitting strategies.
