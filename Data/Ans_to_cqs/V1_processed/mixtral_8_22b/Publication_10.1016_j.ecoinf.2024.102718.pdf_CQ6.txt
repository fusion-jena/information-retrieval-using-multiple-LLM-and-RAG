The text provides information about several preprocessing steps applied to the data before training the deep learning model. These include image augmentation techniques like Gaussian noise, speckle noise, rotation, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, saturation adjustment, hue adjustment, and tensor transformation. Additionally, normalization is performed using mean values of [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and standard deviation values of [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. Image resizing is also mentioned, with all images being resized to dimensions of (224, 224). However, it should be noted that the specific order or sequence of applying these preprocessing steps is not explicitly stated in the given context.
