The authors do not explicitly mention any specific deep learning model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, they discuss evaluating Species Distribution Models (SDMs) using metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC'), Maximum True Skill Statistic (maxTSS), and Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). These metrics help quantify and compare model performances. However, it is essential to note that these metrics might only provide a partial view of the model's quality. Other aspects, such as response curves and mapped predictions, should also be considered based on the focus of the SDM study. Additionally, factors influencing predictions, like covariate selection, model complexity, and parameter tuning, must be thoroughly examined. The paper does not directly address deep learning model evaluation metrics but focuses on assessing SDMs through various methods.
