The paper titled "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning uses a deep learning approach to improve the accuracy of near-surface wind field predictions in mountainous regions. However, the specific type of deep learning model used in this study is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the information available whether they use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. To find out which type of deep learning model is employed, one would need access to the full text of the article or additional sources providing more details about the research methods used.
