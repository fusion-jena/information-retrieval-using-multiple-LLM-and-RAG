The text provides insight into addressing data bias but does not explicitly mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it discusses several methods to improve the quality and reliability of the data. These include applying a series of filters to retain only relevant information, removing duplicates, and focusing on species-level taxonomic information. Additionally, the authors consider factors like body size, habitat depth, and commercial use to understand their impact on record representation in databases. While these approaches do not directly correspond to the mentioned techniques, they contribute to reducing bias by ensuring accurate and representative data.
