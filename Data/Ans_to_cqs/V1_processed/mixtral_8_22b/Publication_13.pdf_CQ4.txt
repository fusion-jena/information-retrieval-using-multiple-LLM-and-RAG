Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, etc., being applied in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined what data augmentation techniques have been implemented in this particular case. However, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
