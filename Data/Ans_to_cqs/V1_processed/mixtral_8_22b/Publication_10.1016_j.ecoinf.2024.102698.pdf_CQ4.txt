Based on the given context, it appears that the study utilizes two main types of data augmentation techniques within its deep learning pipeline - Variational Autoencoders (TVAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). These techniques are employed for generating synthetic data rather than traditional image manipulation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

The TVAE model is used to develop the initial coral cover model. It works by mapping the original data to distributions in a lower dimensional latent space, sampling data from the latent space, and then transforming it back to the original space using a decoder. The learning phase involves minimizing the loss between the original and final data distributions, which is quantified using the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).

On the other hand, the synthetic connectivity data is generated using a GAN model. This model consists of a generator component, which learns the latent features of the data to create a data sample, and a discriminator, which is a classification model that distinguishes between real and synthetic data. The model parameters in the generator are updated via backpropagation from the discriminator, with the magnitude of the update depending on the success of the discriminator in classifying the data.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention traditional data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, or scaling, it highlights the use of advanced deep learning techniques for generating synthetic data.
