The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using learning and loss curves. These curves provide insights into how the model is learning from the training data and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Specifically, the training accuracy curve indicates the model's performance on the training data, while the validation accuracy curve reflects the model's ability to generalize to new data. Similarly, the training loss curve displays the model's performance on the training data as it minimizes the loss function, whereas the validation loss curve evaluates the model's performance on new, unseen data. Additionally, visual representations such as Fig. 7 are employed to illustrate these learning and loss curves, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance during training.
