The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, based on the common practices in deep learning pipelines, these techniques could potentially be employed depending on the nature of the problem being addressed. For example, object detection tasks often use bounding boxes to identify and locate objects within images, while semantic segmentation involves assigning each pixel in an image to a particular class label. Instance segmentation combines both object detection and semantic segmentation to detect individual instances of objects and provide detailed outlines around them. It should also be noted that the choice of data annotation technique depends on factors like the complexity of the task, available resources, and desired level of accuracy.
