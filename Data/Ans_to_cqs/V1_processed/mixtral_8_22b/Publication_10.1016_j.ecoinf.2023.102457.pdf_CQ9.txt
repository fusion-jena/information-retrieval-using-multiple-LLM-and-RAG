Unfortunately, based on the given information, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It does not specify if it is accessible via platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding its availability.
