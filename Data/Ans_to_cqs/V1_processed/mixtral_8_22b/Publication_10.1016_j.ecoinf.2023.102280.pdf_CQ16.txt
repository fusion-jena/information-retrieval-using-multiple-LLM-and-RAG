The text does not explicitly mention any specific criteria for determining when training is complete. However, it does discuss the use of training data for fine-tuning audio enhancement models. In general, common practices for determining when training is complete include observing the performance of the model on a separate validation set and stopping training once the validation loss plateaus or starts increasing, indicating overfitting. Additionally, early stopping can be employed to halt training if no improvement is seen after a certain number of epochs. These principles would likely apply to the fine-tuning process mentioned in the text, although the exact criteria might vary depending on the specific application and model architecture.
