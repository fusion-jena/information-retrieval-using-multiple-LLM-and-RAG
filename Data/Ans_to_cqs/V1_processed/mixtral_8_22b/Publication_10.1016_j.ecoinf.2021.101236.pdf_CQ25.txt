The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. Specifically, the model, named BirdNET, is designed to classify 984 bird species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and spectrogram data. The model is built upon the Wide ResNet design and employs changes suggested in Xie et al.'s research. It consists of three main components: a pre-processing block, a series of residual stacks, and a classification block. The classification block results in probability predictions for all 987 classes per second, followed by global log-mean-exponential pooling and sigmoid activation. The overall process primarily adheres to current best practices in deep learning.
