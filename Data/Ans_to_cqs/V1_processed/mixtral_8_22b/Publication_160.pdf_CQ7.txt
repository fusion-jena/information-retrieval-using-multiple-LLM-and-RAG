Based on the given information, it appears that the data has been divided into training, validation, and test sets for the purpose of deep learning model training. However, the specific criteria used to split the data have not been explicitly mentioned. Typically, the data is randomly split into these subsets, with the majority of the data allocated to the training set, followed by smaller portions assigned to the validation and test sets. The exact proportions can vary depending on factors such as the total amount of available data and the desired balance between model performance and generalization ability.
