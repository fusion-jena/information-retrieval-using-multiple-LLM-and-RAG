The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for behavioral predictions or classification based on the mention of a dependent variable (binary dive/not dive column), which suggests a supervised learning approach. Additionally, the comparison of this model with other methods such as naive Bayes classifiers and hidden Markov models also indicates its application in classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is likely being used for classification purposes.
