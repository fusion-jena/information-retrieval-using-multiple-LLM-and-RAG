While the provided context does not directly discuss specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, some general principles and methods can be mentioned based on common practices in the field.

Data bias can occur due to imbalanced classes or unequal representation of certain groups within the dataset. To tackle these issues, several strategies can be applied during the preprocessing stage:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same class distribution in both subsets. It ensures that the model learns from a representative sample of all classes.

2. Oversampling: When dealing with imbalanced classes, one way to improve the balance is by duplicating samples from the minority class until they reach a similar number as the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is a popular oversampling method that generates new synthetic examples instead of simply copying existing ones.

3. Undersampling: Another approach to handling imbalanced classes is reducing the size of the majority class by randomly removing samples. However, this may lead to losing valuable information if not done carefully.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting more diverse data can help reduce bias by ensuring that different groups or scenarios are adequately represented in the dataset. This might involve gathering additional samples from underrepresented classes or acquiring data from various sources.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline often involves using techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and collecting diverse data. These methods aim to create a balanced and representative dataset that allows the model to learn effectively without being influenced by biases present in the original data.
