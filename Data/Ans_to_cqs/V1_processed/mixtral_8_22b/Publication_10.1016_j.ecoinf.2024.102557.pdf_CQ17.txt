The query asks about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function during training. Two common regularization methods mentioned in the given context are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst them. By ignoring certain neurons, the network becomes less sensitive to specific weights in the network and thus generalizes better. Dropout can be applied to any layer in the neural network, including input, hidden, and output layers.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights to the loss function. The goal of L2 regularization is to keep the weights small and avoid overfitting. It encourages the model to spread out the weights across all features rather than depending too much on individual ones.

Other regularization methods not explicitly mentioned in the given context include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights to the loss function. Early stopping stops the training process before it converges when the validation error starts increasing. Data augmentation generates new training samples by applying transformations to existing ones, helping the model learn more robust representations.

In summary, regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines by adding penalties to the loss function during training. Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation.
