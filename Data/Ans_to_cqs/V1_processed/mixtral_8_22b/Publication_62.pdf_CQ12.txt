The pipeline uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. This is evident from the table titled "Constitutive layers and tensor/vector shapes for the unstained/stained CNN" which lists various layers such as ConvolutionLayer, BatchNormalizationLayer, PoolingLayer, FlattenLayer, DropoutLayer, LinearLayer, SoftmaxLayer, etc., all of which are associated with CNN architectures. Furthermore, the paper mentions that the model includes two convolutional layers and two pooling layers, further confirming its use of a CNN architecture.
